6,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if the answer ""False"" is correct for whether the dog from Little Rascals is still alive. Let me look at the passage again.The passage mentions Pete the Pup in two different time periods. The original one was active from 1924 to June 1930 so that's about 12 years ago by now. Then there's a second Pete who started on September 9 1929 and ended around January 28 1946. So both versions of the dog were alive during their respective times but died long before today.The question is asking if the dog from Little Rascals is still alive now. Since the passage doesn't mention any living descendants or a continuation into modern times and both main characters are deceased it's safe to say that no the dog isn't still alive. The answer should be False.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,5.174382999975933,0.001620063615145481,0.00047568403478471995,0.01737610000418499,4.407499450468005e-06,1.2941325898006697e-06
1,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if anyone has climbed the North Face of Everest based on the given passage. Let me read through it carefully.The passage says that The North Face is the northern side of Mount Everest and mentions George Mallory's body was found there. It also quotes an author or climber saying that a slip on the North Face would mean death which implies its danger. Now the question is whether anyone has climbed it. I know that climbing Everest usually refers to reaching the summit but here ""climbed"" could be ambiguousâ€”does it mean ascending the mountain via the North Face or just being on that side? The passage doesn't explicitly state if someone successfully summited from there. George Mallory was found dead on the North Face so he attempted a climb but didn't succeed. Later expeditions might have used other routes to reach the summit like the South Col route. But has anyone actually climbed the North Face and reached the top? I'm not sure if that's mentioned here.The passage doesn't mention any successful ascents via the North Face. It just talks about Mallory being found there. So unless someone else did it after him but the question is whether anyone has climbed it at all. Since the passage only refers to Mallory's body being on the North Face without indicating he reached the summit from that side maybe no one had successfully climbed it by then? Or perhaps others have since his time.Wait I think the key here is that the passage doesn't provide information about anyone else climbing the North Face. It just says George Mallory was found there and notes its danger. So without explicit mention of a successful climb on that face in the passage we can't confirm it from this text alone. The answer would be ""False"" based solely on the given passage because no one is mentioned to have done so.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,7.7899415000283625,0.002492740957701946,0.0007319200711302366,0.030255400022724643,7.930976115555193e-06,2.328697887638047e-06
5,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Hope was married to Wyatt in Bold and Beautiful based on the passage provided.First I need to understand the key points of the passage. It describes a series of events involving Wyatt Rick Hope Liam Quinn and others. There's a mention of Hope marrying someone named Liam after being involved with him but then she marries Wyatt instead because she realizes her feelings for him. The passage also mentions that later after some conflict Hope leaves LA to join her mother in Milan and Wyatt files for divorce mutually.So the question is whether Hope was married to Wyatt on Bold and Beautiful. Since the show's name is Bold and Beautiful I need to check if the marriage between Hope and Wyatt happened within the context of that TV series. The passage seems to be a summary or part of the storyline from the show. The answer should be based solely on whether the events described in the passage indicate their marriage took place during the time period mentioned as being on Bold and Beautiful. From the text after Hope rejects Liam she marries Wyatt on the yacht with the HFTF diamond. Then later they get divorced. So yes their marriage occurred while both were part of the show's characters.I should make sure there's no trick here. The question is specifically about whether Hope was married to Wyatt during her time on Bold and Beautiful. Since she marries him after leaving LA with Liam but before he finds out about Quinn pushing Ivy into the Seine that marriage definitely happened while they were both in the show. Therefore the answer should be True.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,9.518096799991326,0.003095585780665623,0.0009089277238270666,0.01898840002832003,4.853236169160781e-06,1.4250100682016898e-06

Let me read through it carefully.The passage starts by mentioning Meredith moving into her dream home and selling her house to Alex. Then it says she gives birth to a son. The baby is delivered via C-section which means surgery was involved. During the procedure Shane Ross finishes stitching Meredith up because the obstetrician left. After that there's mention of DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) and Bailey performs a spleen removal to save her life. Then Derek and Meredith name their son Bailey.Wait so the question is whether Meredith has a baby in Grey's Anatomy. The passage clearly states she gives birth to a son. So yes that means she does have a baby there. But just to make sure let me check each part again. Meredith discovers she's pregnant and undergoes a C-section because of complications. She ends up with DIC during the surgery which is treated by Bailey removing her spleen. Then they name their son Bailey. So all these events happen in Grey's Anatomy right?

2,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Air Force One flies with a fighter escort usually or not. The passage says that ""The Air Force usually does not have fighter aircraft escort the presidential aircraft over the United States but it has occurred..."" So according to this normally there isn't an escort but sometimes they do use one.Wait so the question is specifically about whether Air Force One flies with a fighter escort in general.

3,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if the question ""has the world cup been won on penalties"" is true or false based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully again.The passage says that penalty shoot-outs were introduced in 1978 but didn't occur before then. The first time a World Cup title was won via penalties was in 1994 and there's another mention of ""the only other time"" which is probably referring to the final being decided by penalties again so maybe that's the second time it happened. Then it mentions that as of 2018 30 shoot-outs had taken place but only two reached sudden death after the initial kicks were tied.Wait the question is asking if the World Cup has ever been won on penalties. The passage explicitly states that the first time was in 1994 and there's another instance mentioned as ""the only other time"" which likely refers to a second occurrence of winning via penalties. So even though it says ""only two reached the sudden death stage "" I think those are the shoot-outs where penalties were used but maybe not necessarily that they were the sole method for determining the winner in those cases.But regardless the passage clearly mentions at least two instances (1994 and 2006) where the World Cup was won on penalties. So even if there's more than two after 2018 the answer to whether it has been won on penalties is definitely yes. The question isn't asking about recent times but in general so based on the passage the answer should be true.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,13.846105100004934,0.004570481702694535,0.001341987534885931,0.009347699990030378,2.2317911103729987e-06,6.552998229539058e-07
4,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether days get longer or shorter at the Equator. I remember that the passage says daytime length there remains 12 hours in all seasons. So no matter what season it is day and night are each about 12 hours long. That means the length doesn't change; it's constant throughout the year. The question seems to be implying some variation but according to the info that's not the case at the Equator.

It says it began broadcasting on March 26 2017 and describes characters like DS Kate Fleming DCI Roseanne Huntley etc. along with supporting cast members. Also it mentions that the storyline is thematically linked to Series 1.Since the passage explicitly states ""the fourth series "" that confirms there was a Series 4.

It also says he was made Baron Arklow and Earl of Inverness at the same time in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Then it mentions that after his death in 1843 the title became extinct because his children from an annulled marriage didn't inherit.Wait so Prince Augustus Frederick is referred to as a duke here? The question is whether there was a Duke of Sussex before. Since he received the dukedom in 1801 and it's part of the Peerage of the United Kingdom that would mean yes there was a Duke of Sussex at least from then until his death.But I should double-check if ""the sixth son"" implies he had siblings who were dukes before him.

I need to check the passage provided for any information that might confirm or deny this.The passage says both the UK and the Netherlands are constitutional monarchies. It mentions King Willem-Alexander as being around 890th in line to the British throne. That means he's related to the British royal family but it doesn't say anything about the Netherlands being part of the UK.

It says the first series premiered in June 2011 and then mentions a second series aired in 2013. That seems like a clear indication there was a Season 2. Wait but let me check again to make sure I didn't miss anything. The passage also talks about how the second series had three feature-length episodes each self-contained at ninety minutes per episode. It mentions that filming for the second series started in October 2012 and that the first two episodes of Season 2 are adaptations but the third is original.

From the passage provided it says ""Salt Lake City (often shortened to Salt Lake and abbreviated as SLC) is the capital and the most populous municipality of the U.S. state of Utah."" So yes being the most populous municipality means it's the largest city by population in Utah.

12,"<think>Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is asking if the Central Bank of India was a nationalised bank. I remember that in the passage it says in 1963 Burma's revolutionary government nationalized Central Bank of India's operations there turning them into People's Bank No. 1. But wait the Central Bank of India is actually based in India right? The name suggests it's Indian. So maybe the bank mentioned was a branch or part of CBI operating in Burma.Hold on I think ""Central Bank of India"" refers to the main institution established by the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934. But the passage mentions nationalization by the Burmese government affecting their operations there. That might mean that the specific branch was taken over but the central bank itself wasn't nationalized in India. The question is about whether Central Bank of India (the main entity) is a nationalised bank.I know that many banks in India were nationalized during the 1960s and 70s under government policies. For example major commercial banks like SBI's predecessors were taken over by the state. But was CBI itself nationalized? Wait noâ€”CBI is actually a private sector bank until it was merged with Canbank and UCO Bank to form SBI in 2008. So before that it wasn't part of the nationalised banks.The passage talks about an incident in Burma where their operations were nationalized. That doesn't necessarily mean CBI as a whole is considered nationalised. The question might be conflating the branch operation with the main bank's status. Since CBI was never nationalised by the Indian government but rather merged later the answer should be False.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,23.725001200014958,0.007914678897079568,0.0023239126887311776,0.016231299989158288,4.113747221870452e-06,1.2078808870774162e-06

It says they're the first main series installments on Switch since those games were remakes of older titles but part of the main series. The original question is whether it's a spin-off.Spin-offs usually take elements from the main series and create something new maybe with different characters or settings. But in this case Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee are enhanced remakes of PokÃ©mon Yellow (1998) which was part of the main series. They also integrate features from PokÃ©mon Go but aren't a separate spin-off themselves; they're more like updates to existing games. The passage doesn't mention them as spin-offs but rather as new entries in the main RPG series for Switch.So even though there might be some spin-off elements elsewhere (like PokÃ©mon Go) these specific games are part of the main series.

Then it mentions Leslie goes missing and Ron finds her in the council chambers where she's feeling down about letting her friends down. After some conversation Leslie tells Ben he should accept the job. The recount comes in later stating that Leslie has won. There's also mention of Jerry and Bobby being relieved which makes sense if Leslie wins instead.So initially it seems like Bobby won but then a recount is triggered because of his small win margin.

From the passage provided it says that the song is a 1987 power ballad from the film Dirty Dancing performed by Patrick Swayze. So yes the song is part of the movie. I need to make sure there's no trick here. The question uses ""in dirty dancing"" which might be interpreted as whether the song appears in the movie or if it was just inspired by it.

Let me read through the passage carefully again.The passage mentions Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson as film producers working on Top Gun. They had over 300 songs but weren't satisfied with any so they asked Giorgio Moroder to write something new. With Tom Whitlock's help Moroder composed ""Danger Zone"" and Joe Pizzulo recorded a demo. Then Columbia Records wanted an artist signed by them to perform it.Wait the question is about whether ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" was written for Top Gun. But in the passage the song mentioned is just called ""Danger Zone"". The title ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" might be a different version or perhaps a misremembered name. I recall that ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" is actually the official theme song from Top Gun but maybe it's an alternate version? Or could there be confusion between the track and its performance? The passage doesn't mention ""Highway "" just ""Danger Zone"". So unless the question refers to a different song with that title which isn't in the passage then based on this info the answer should be false. But wait maybe ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" is another name for the same song? Let me think... Actually upon checking my knowledge I know that ""Danger Zone"" was indeed written for Top Gun by Giorgio Moroder and performed by Berlin. The version with ""Highway"" might be a different track or an alternate mix. However since the passage only talks about ""Danger Zone "" unless it's explicitly stated elsewhere we can't assume that ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" is part of this process.So the answer should be false because the passage doesn't mention anything called ""Highway to the Danger Zone.""

I remember that the Champions League Final is a single match between the winners of the group stages from both the Premier League and the Champions League knockout phase. So each year there's just one final match played at the end to determine the winner. The passage mentions it was the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final which took place on May 26th in Kiev between Real Madrid and Liverpool. It says that this is the final match of the season organized by UEFA. So yes there's only one game at the end to crown the champion. I think sometimes people might confuse it with other tournaments or leagues having multiple rounds but the Champions League Final itself is just one game.

Wait no actually during that season finale Negan attacks the prison and kills most of the people there but I think Glenn was okay then. Then in Season 7 the premiere is mentioned here. The passage says that in the seventh season premiere Negan beats Abraham to death with Lucille and later he also kills Glenn. So if Negan killed him in Season 7 that means Glenn didn't die in Season 6. Let me double-check my memory. Yes in Season 6 Glenn survives the prison attack because they escape before it's all over.

So ""tea tree"" and ""melaleuca"" are different names for the same plant species? Or is there a distinction between them?Hmm in common usage tea tree often refers to Melaleuca alternifolia which is part of the Melaleuca genus. But sometimes people might use ""tea tree"" generically for other plants like Melaleuca cajuputi or even different species within related genera. However based on the passage it specifically says tea tree oil is from Melaleuca alternifolia and that's also known as melaleuca oil.So if someone asks whether ""melaleuca"" and ""tea tree"" are the same thing they're likely referring to the plant species. The answer would be true because Melaleuca alternifolia is commonly called tea tree making them synonymous in this context.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,26.50231330000679,0.008977401748597388,0.0026359499995762354,0.030332299997098744,7.892723338526073e-06,2.3174660846712864e-06
22,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if someone can get a rash from using a hot tub based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully again.The passage says that Hot tub folliculitis is caused by an infection of hair follicles due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is commonly found in places like hot tubs and water slides. It mentions that children are more prone because they stay longer but adults can also get it. The rash appears on the skin resembling chicken pox initially then turns into pimples. The question is asking if you can get a rash from using a hot tub. From the passage yes Hot tub folliculitis presents as a rash. So even though the condition might be more common in children who stay longer adults can still develop it by using hot tubs. The key point here is that the infection comes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa found in hot tubs and the symptoms include a rash. Therefore the answer should be True.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,23.77481869998155,0.008047094708971251,0.002362792697566061,0.019750600011320785,5.066123887243318e-06,1.4875182856240777e-06
23,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if it's possible to have twins with two different fathers based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully again.The passage explains superfecundation as the fertilization of two or more ova from the same cycle by sperm from separate sexual intercourses. It mentions that heteropaternal superfecundation involves two different fathers leading to fraternal twins who are half siblings. The term comes from fecund meaning offspring production. Also it says this can happen through natural intercourse or artificial insemination.The question is asking if you can have twin babies with two different biological fathers. From the passage heteropaternal superfecundation specifically refers to that scenario where two separate ova are fertilized by sperm from different fathers in the same cycle. So yes according to the text it's possible through this phenomenon.I should make sure I'm not missing anything. The passage says it's rare but can occur. There's no contradiction here; the answer is directly stated as true under heteropaternal superfecundation. No other factors mentioned that would prevent this from happening in natural circumstances or via artificial insemination. So the correct response should be 'True'.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,23.897557899996173,0.008099831868250439,0.002375971934612889,0.024490100011462346,6.407134998395729e-06,1.881266759499183e-06
24,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if Thousand Island dressing is the same as French dressing. I need to check the passage for any information that directly compares them.The passage mentions that sociologists found different origin stories among villages and islands in the Thousand Islands region. One of those stories involves a third origin where it was based on French dressing supported by a recipe from The Fannie Farmer Cookbook (1965). But wait does this mean they are the same? No because the passage says that all claims were oral traditions without written records. So even though there's an origin story suggesting Thousand Island might have come from French dressing it doesn't necessarily mean they're identical.The Fannie Farmer Cookbook recipe is from 1965 which is after the supposed creation of Thousand Island dressing in the late 19th century. But that just shows a connection through history not that they are the same today. Also the passage indicates multiple origin stories exist so maybe French dressing was an influence but not exactly the same.So the answer should be False because even if there's historical overlap or similarity Thousand Island isn't the same as French dressing.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,23.663381699996535,0.008009724520559846,0.0023518200407901075,0.021324099972844124,5.548127222250009e-06,1.6290443893104962e-06
25,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether liquid nitrogen is the same as dry ice based on the passage provided.First I need to understand what the passage says about both substances. It mentions that they are occasionally used for freezing and removing warts but points out that liquid nitrogen performs better because it's colder and requires less time. Then there's a mention of dry ice having fewer storage issues since it can be generated from compressed carbon dioxide.So the key point here is comparing their effectiveness in freezing. Liquid nitrogen being colder than dry ice suggests they are different substances. Dry ice is solid CO2 while liquid nitrogen is a liquid gas at very low temperatures. The passage doesn't say they're the same; instead it contrasts them by saying liquid nitrogen works better due to its temperature and other factors.Also storage differences: dry ice can be generated from compressed CO2 as needed which implies it's not stored in the same way as liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen is typically kept in specialized tanks because of its extremely low boiling point (-196Â°C). Dry ice melts at a higher temperature (-78Â°C) and is easier to handle in terms of storage.Therefore they are different substances with distinct properties. The answer should be False.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,24.264255600020988,0.008217921149031698,0.0024129508577124866,0.021735999995144084,5.594572780117031e-06,1.6426817614219787e-06
26,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if Fred from First Dates has a partner. From the passage provided it mentions that Sirieux (which I assume is a typo for Fred Sirieix) said he was living with his former partner and their two children in 2016 but was in a new relationship. Then in 2018 he announced being in a relationship referring to his partner as 'fruitcake'. So the key points are that he has mentioned both a current partner (in 2018) and previously had one who left him with two kids. The question is whether Fred from First Dates has a partner now.The passage doesn't specify if this new relationship in 2018 is still ongoing or ended later but it does mention that he was in a new relationship at the time of the interview (2016) and then again referred to his 'fruitcake' partner in 2018. Since the question is about whether he has a partner now without any information on what happened after 2018 I can't say for sure if he still does. The passage only confirms that as of 2016 and possibly up to 2018 he had one but doesn't give recent status.Therefore based solely on the given passage which ends in 2018 without mentioning a current partner beyond that time I can't definitively say yes. The answer should be 'False' because there's no information indicating he has a partner at present.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,26.250912899995456,0.00889232875965413,0.00261097081835557,0.018766900000628084,4.826815557155189e-06,1.4172524325120733e-06
27,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if breakfast lunch and dinner are always served in Italy. I remember from the passage that Italian meals have a structure typical of the Mediterranean region which differs from Northern Europe or other areas. It mentions that while these three main meals exist there's less emphasis on breakfast compared to other countries. So Italians do eat breakfast but sometimes they skip it or make it lighter. Also late-morning and mid-afternoon snacks are common. The passage says ""though it still often consists of breakfast lunch and supper."" Wait supper is mentioned instead of dinner here. Supper might be the evening meal in Italy. But does that mean dinner (seconda colazione or something) isn't part of it? No actually in Italian contexts dinner can refer to cena which is the main evening meal. The passage uses ""breakfast lunch and supper "" so maybe they use different terms for the same meals.But the question says ""always served."" Even though breakfast is often included but sometimes skipped or light does that mean it's not always there? Yes because if it can be omitted then it's not a universal part of Italian meal structure. The passage also mentions snacks and dividing celebratory meals into courses which adds more complexity to their eating habits.So the answer should reflect whether these three are consistently present in every Italian day. Since breakfast isn't always served (sometimes skipped) the statement that they are always served is false.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,25.47382519999519,0.00862899084516251,0.002533649384489581,0.029402099986327812,7.656346664104299e-06,2.2480610260261996e-06
28,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if Scar is alive in Lion King 2. I remember that Lion King 2 refers to ""The Lion King 1 and a Half"" or possibly another sequel but usually it's just called Lion King 2. Wait the passage mentions Scar appearing in Simba's nightmare as a reflection. So in that dream sequence Scar is shown through a reflection which implies he might be dead because reflections are often used for deceased characters. Plus in the original movies Scar died when Mufasa pushed him off the cliff. The movie where Simba faces Kovu again is probably ""The Lion King Returns"" or something similar but I think the main sequel after Return of the King (which might be considered as part 2) still shows Scar through a reflection in a dream. So yes that suggests he's not alive anymore.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,25.782219000015175,0.008732100420996416,0.0025639244789976505,0.053190200007520616,1.4199637801508579e-05,4.1693060314157335e-06
29,<think>Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is asking if alligators drown their prey and eat it later. I need to check the passage for that information.Reading through the passage again... It says they may kill larger prey by grabbing it and dragging it into water to drown. So yes drowning is part of how they handle big meals. Then it mentions that after killing they might not eat it immediately but instead let it rot or use a death roll to tear it into smaller pieces. The passage specifically states that alligators can't eat prey in one bite if it's too large and uses the death roll method by spinning until chunks are torn off.So when an alligator drowns its prey they don't necessarily eat it right away. They might drag it underwater to suffocate it first then bring it up for a death roll or let it partially rot before consuming. The question is whether they drown and then eat later. From the passage yes that's correct because they kill larger prey by drowning but process it through methods like death roll or allow it to rot which implies eating later.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,25.969080900016706,0.008787116630346724,0.0025800783708557584,0.03314640000462532,8.669684445744174e-06,2.5455978635083297e-06
30,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if cowpeas and black-eyed peas are the same thing. I remember from the passage that cultivated cowpeas have a common name called ""black-eyed pea."" So since one of their names is black-eyed pea they must be referring to the same plant or bean.Wait but sometimes people use different terms interchangeably. The passage mentions several common names for cowpeas: black-eyed pea southern pea yardlong bean catjang and crowder pea. Southern peas are another name for yellow-eyed peas which might be confused with black-eyed peas. But the question specifically says ""cowpeas"" and ""black eyed peas."" I think in culinary contexts both terms are used to describe similar types of beans but they're actually the same speciesâ€”Vigna unguiculata. The passage lists ""black-eyed pea"" as a common name for cowpeas so that directly links them. There's no mention here of two different species; it just says cowpeas are known by those names.So even though there might be regional variations in how they're called (like southern peas vs. black-eyed peas) the passage explicitly states that ""cultivated cowpeas"" include ""black-eyed pea"" as a common name.

31,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if the Isle of Man is part of the European Economic Area (EEA). I remember that the passage says the Isle of Man holds neither membership nor associate membership of the EU and lies outside the EEA. So it's not a member state or an associated country. But wait there's something about Protocol 3 allowing trade without non-EU tariffs. That might be confusing because if they're outside the EEA but still have some trade agreements maybe they are part of it? No the passage clearly states that the Isle of Man is outside the European Economic Area. Even though there's a protocol for trade being outside the EEA means not part of it. So the answer should be false.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,25.84768870001426,0.0087530235230305,0.0025700679325649915,0.03545060000033118,9.316488888968403e-06,2.735512965849516e-06
32,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if King Louie died in the Jungle Book (2016). I remember that in Disney movies especially the older ones like the original Jungle Book from 1967 King Louie does die at the end after he tries to fly and fails. But wait the passage mentions something else: during the credits Louie is shown emerging from the rubble and performing a song with modified lyrics. That sounds more like the 2016 version's change.So in the original story King Louie does die tragically when he attempts to fly too close to the tree where Shere Khan is waiting. But in the 2016 live-action remake they probably changed that part because the passage says during the credits Louie emerges and performs. That means in this version he didn't die but instead survived and sang his song again.Therefore the answer should be False because according to the passage provided King Louie is shown emerging from the rubble after the credits implying he's alive not dead.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,25.70555690000765,0.008704481657187707,0.0025558150412684946,0.04022819999954663,1.062712333433511e-05,3.120342225189362e-06
33,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the dorsal root ganglion carries sensory input. I remember that from biology classes the dorsal root ganglion is part of the spinal cord and it contains cell bodies for sensory neurons. These neurons are responsible for carrying sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. So yes they handle sensory input like touch pain temperature. The passage mentions that the cell bodies of first-order sensory neurons are located there which definitely means they process sensory data.

So Wade's rookie season included that year where they made the playoffs. But wait does ""qualified"" mean he was part of the playoff team? Yes since he played for the Heat during their entire season as a rookie.Then it mentions his playoff performance against the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals. That would be after his rookie year because the 2004 All-Rookie Team and rookie of the year voting are discussed separately. So that playoff appearance was actually in his second year not the first.Wait so during his rookie season (2003-2004) did he make the playoffs? The team qualified for the playoffs after the regular season which is part of Wade's rookie year as a player. Even though they lost in the first round to the Indiana Pacers later that same season that playoff run was still during his rookie year because it happened before June 2004 when he earned All-Rookie honors.So yes Wade did make the playoffs as a rookie with the Miami Heat.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,26.610253799997736,0.009010078468157502,0.00264554455725815,0.01890540000749752,4.840920001151972e-06,1.4213937876823654e-06
35,<think>Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is asking if England has ever won the FIFA Women's World Cup. I need to check the passage provided for any information about that.Looking at the passage again: It says they qualified four times reached quarter-finals in 1995 2007 and 2011 and finished third in 2015. Also mentioned is reaching the final of the UEFA Women's Championship in 1984 and 2009.So England didn't win any World Cup according to this passage. The closest they got was finishing third in 2015. They also reached finals but not necessarily won those either especially since it specifies the UEFA Championship final which is different from FIFA's World Cup. Wait did they ever reach the FIFA Women's World Cup final? The passage doesn't mention that. It only talks about their performance in the World Cup up to 2015 where they were third. So no win there. Also winning the UEFA Championship isn't the same as the FIFA World Cup because different tournaments have different winners.So putting it all together: England qualified four times but didn't mention any wins or even reaching a final in the FIFA Women's World Cup. They did reach finals of another tournament (UEFA) but that doesn't count for this question. Therefore the answer should be False.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,27.138721199997235,0.009194120688280223,0.002699583142545958,0.04060199999366887,1.0590247911070387e-05,3.10951484164777e-06
36,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if finding a four-leaf clover is considered lucky based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully again.The passage starts by mentioning that the four-leaf clover is a rare variation of the three-leaf clover. It says that according to traditional superstition it brings good luck but doesn't specify when or how this started. Then there's an early mention from 1640 where they talked about keeping ""Fower-leafed or purple grasse"" because it was good for purples in children. That seems more medicinal than lucky.Next a description from 1869 talks about sorceresses gathering four-leaf clovers at night during the full moon to mix with vervain and other ingredients. This suggests some magical use but not necessarily luck. Then there's a letter from an 11-year-old girl in 1877 where she asks if fairies whispered that finding a four-leaf clover brings good luck. So here someone is associating the find with luck through fairy folklore.Putting this together: The passage mentions both historical uses (medicinal and magical) and later superstition about luck. However it doesn't explicitly state that finding one is lucky until the 1877 letter. Before that the references are more about practical or ritualistic purposes rather than luck. So while there's a tradition linking it to good fortune the passage itself presents multiple origins without confirming its luckiness definitively.But wait the question is asking if it *is* lucky based on the passage. The answer provided was ""True"". However I need to determine if that's correct or not. Let me check again. The first part says according to traditional superstition four-leaf clovers bring good luck. So even though there are other historical uses mentioned the initial statement is about superstition and luck. Therefore despite some ambiguity in how exactly the superstition started (as per the passage) the overall implication from the text is that it's considered lucky due to traditional beliefs.So yes according to the passage finding a four-leaf clover is associated with good luck through traditional superstition.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,27.613381600007415,0.009359962769942474,0.0027482777924379086,0.015026000008219853,3.7735222266443696e-06,1.1079838231900688e-06
37,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if the mafia is still active in New Jersey based on the passage provided. I need to answer with just 'True' or 'False'.First looking at the passage it mentions the DeCavalcante crime family operating in Elizabeth New Jersey and surrounding areas. It also refers to them being part of the American Mafia (or Cosa Nostra). The passage says they are still active because their operations are described as ongoing including various illegal activities like bookmaking extortion etc.The question is whether the mafia is still active there. Since the DeCavalcante family is explicitly mentioned as an Italian-American organized crime family in New Jersey and their activities are listed without any indication that they stopped it implies current activity. Also references to documentaries and TV shows about them being aired suggest that their influence or operations were recognized even after some time but doesn't necessarily mean they're still active.Wait the passage says ""operates"" which is present tense so as of the information given yes they are currently active in New Jersey. The term ""still"" might imply whether it's ongoing now and since the passage uses current language (""operates"") that should confirm the mafia is still active there.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,28.47766380000394,0.009663648925221797,0.0028374463005761243,0.030201499990653247,7.903307218091667e-06,2.320573729635577e-06

It mentions that the program is based on real-life forced adoption in Australia. Julia Gillard the former Prime Minister offered a national apology related to this issue in 2013. So the key point here is that the show's premise comes from actual events involving forced adoptions in Australia. The passage explicitly states it was ""based on the real life forced adoption...""

39,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if liquor stores in Oklahoma are open on the 4th of July. I remember from the passage that sales are prohibited on Independence Day. Since Oklahoma observes Independence Day as a holiday and the passage says it's illegal to sell packaged liquor on that day off-premises which includes Sundays but also lists specific holidays like Memorial Day Independence Day etc. where sales are banned.So if Independence Day is one of those days prohibited for selling low-point beer off-premises then yes liquor stores can't legally sell alcohol on the 4th.

40,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if thread seal tape is the same as Teflon tape. From what I remember both terms are used interchangeably in plumbing contexts but there might be a nuance here.The passage mentions that Thread seal tape is made of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) and also refers to it by the genericized trademark ""Teflon tape."" However it specifically says that Chemours who own the Teflon brand consider this usage incorrect because they no longer manufacture Teflon in tape form. So technically since they don't produce it under their brand anymore maybe there's a difference.But wait genericized trademarks mean people use ""Teflon"" even though it's a brand name for PTFE products generally. The passage clarifies that while Teflon is the same as PTFE the term ""Teflon tape"" isn't officially recognized by Chemours anymore because they stopped making their own version in tape form. So thread seal tape is indeed made of PTFE and often called Teflon tape even though it's not a direct product from DuPont anymore.So the answer should be True because despite the trademark issue both terms refer to the same material (PTFE) used for sealing threads.</think>True",True,False,0,0.0,28.91724750000867,0.009800929930555312,0.0028777548303806685,0.021101599995745346,5.432801107235719e-06,1.5951822673585026e-06
41,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if Dr. Burke comes back after Season 3. I remember that in Grey's Anatomy Dr. Meredith Grey's ex-boyfriend who was a surgeon had an arc about his departure and return.The passage says he officially returns in the tenth season to conclude Cristina Yang's exit. So seasons 4 through 9 are mentioned as part of later seasons where he might have been referenced but not necessarily returning until Season 10. The question is specifically about after Season 3 which would be Seasons 4 onwards.If he returned in Season 10 that means before Season 10 including up to Season 3 he wasn't back.

42,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether a dog can be mixed with three breeds based on the passage provided.First I need to understand what ""designer dogs"" are according to the text. From the examples given like Schnoodle (Schnauzer and Poodle) Shepsky (German Shepherd and Husky) and Puggle (Pug and Beagle) it's clear that these terms combine parts of two purebred names.Now the passage mentions ""complex crosses"" with multiple breeds in recent ancestry. Specifically it gives German Chusky as an example combining German Shepherd Dog Husky and Chow Chow. So three different breeds are involved here. The question is whether a dog can be mixed with three breeds. Since the passage explicitly states that there are complex crosses involving more than two breeds labeled in this manner the answer should be true. The examples provided confirm that combining three or more breeds into a ""designer dog"" label exists.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,27.091280599997845,0.009182626334700537,0.00269620816366432,0.055182999989483505,1.4806829527882372e-05,4.347590024457234e-06
43,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if someone has to be a Mormon to attend BYU. I remember that in the passage provided it mentions that Slightly more than 98 percent of these students are active members of the LDS Church. Since Mormons and members of the LDS Church are essentially the same thing that means most students there are Mormons. But does that mean non-Mormons can't attend? The passage says ""Students from every state in the U.S. and from many foreign countries attend BYU."" It doesn't specify religion as a requirement for admission. However it's noted that nearly all attendees (98%) are LDS members. So while the majority is Mormon there might be exceptions since 2% aren't. The question is whether you have to be a Mormon and given that non-members exist but are a small minority the answer would still be yes because the institution is closely tied to the LDS Church. BYU was founded by the LDS Church so it's likely they prefer or require affiliation with the church for admission. But the passage doesn't explicitly state that as a requirement; it just reports on the existing student body composition. However based on common knowledge and the context of such universities even if not stated outright being a member is probably necessary. The question might be interpreted strictly from the text: does the passage say non-Mormons attend? Yes but only 2%. So technically you don't have to be a Mormon because there are exceptions but in practice it's required. Wait noâ€”the passage doesn't mention any admission policies just that students come from various places and backgrounds. The question is asking if one must be a member to attend. Since the LDS Church owns BYU they might require affiliation. But without explicit statement maybe the answer is false? Hmm but the fact that 98% are members suggests it's a de facto requirement. However the passage doesn't say non-members aren't accepted; it just states their enrollment stats. So strictly speaking based on the text alone we can't confirm if non-Mormons are allowed or not. The answer would be false because there isn't direct evidence in the passage that admission requires being a Mormon.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,30.789694499981124,0.010441215041342374,0.0030657557224841683,0.038762299984227866,1.0222960558086117e-05,3.0016717123041927e-06
44,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether a certification of birth is the same as a birth certificate. I need to check the passage provided for any information that might clarify this.The passage says that ""the actual record of birth is stored with a government agency"" and they issue ""certified copies or representations of the original birth record."" It also mentions that these certifications are signed by the registrar who's commissioned by the government. So here the term used is ""certification "" which refers to official documents issued from the original record.Now in common usage a ""birth certificate"" is indeed an official document proving someone's birth and containing details like name date time parents' information etc. issued by a government authority. The passage talks about certified copies of that record being used for benefits like passports. So it seems the certification mentioned here is essentially another term for the birth certificate itself.Wait but sometimes ""certification"" might refer to an attestation or verification process rather than the document. However in this context since they mention issuing representations (copies) signed by the registrar as part of applying for benefits those certified copies are what people typically call a birth certificate. Therefore yes the certification of birth is the same as a birth certificate.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,27.500163300021086,0.009325921325740134,0.0027382825235011303,0.022828999994089827,5.875224996513377e-06,1.7250870308315381e-06
45,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if the right atrium receives blood from the lungs based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully again.The passage says that humans have a four-chambered heart with two atria and two ventricles. The right atrium is described as receiving deoxygenated blood from several sources: superior vena cava inferior vena cava anterior cardiac veins smallest cardiac veins and the coronary sinus. Then it sends this blood to the right ventricle via the tricuspid valve which then pumps it into the pulmonary artery for pulmonary circulation.Now the question is whether the right atrium receives blood from the lungs. The lungs are involved in oxygenating the deoxygenated blood that goes through them during pulmonary circulation. But does the right atrium directly receive blood from the lungs?From what I remember the right atrium collects deoxygenated blood from the body via veins like the vena cava and then sends it to the right ventricle which pumps it into the lungs through the pulmonary artery. The left side of the heart handles oxygenated blood after it comes back from the lungs.So in this case the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from systemic circulation (like the vena cava) not directly from the lungs. The lungs are part of the pathway where that blood goes to get oxygenated but the actual reception into the heart is done by the left atrium via pulmonary veins.Therefore the answer should be false because the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body's circulation not from the lungs.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,30.098291999980574,0.010212513614271423,0.0029986042744958967,0.01742389998980798,4.495118337379406e-06,1.3198592990852421e-06
46,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether every country has their own sign language. I need to check if that's true or false based on the passage provided.First looking at the passage. It mentions there are about three hundred sign languages globally. Then it says these can emerge through creolization and de novo processes sometimes with language planning. The example given is Sri Lanka and Tanzania where each deaf school might have a separate sign language. But wait does that mean every country has their own? Not necessarily because the passage also talks about countries sharing sign languages under different names like Croatian and Serbian or Indian and Pakistani sign languages.So even though some countries have unique sign languages within their educational systems others share them. That means not every single country has its own distinct sign language. The answer should be false.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,27.477576499979477,0.009321958278186404,0.0027371188911395504,0.032317700010025874,8.451751107835057e-06,2.4816081482147106e-06
47,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if the answer ""True"" or ""False"" correctly responds to whether there is such a thing as dry water based on the passage provided. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.The passage describes dry water as an unusual form of ""powdered liquid "" specifically a water-air emulsion where tiny water droplets are coated with silica making them feel sandy and preventing them from combining into bulk liquid. It mentions that it's 95% liquid water but appears as a white powder similar to table salt. Researchers also call it ""empty water.""Now the question is asking if there exists such a thing as dry water. The passage clearly states its existence by explaining what it is and how it works. So yes according to the information given dry water does exist. I should check for any contradictions or misleading parts in the passage. It says ""Dry water actually consists of 95% liquid water "" which confirms that it's a real substance with a specific composition. The term ""emulsion"" is used here and emulsions are mixtures where two liquids normally don't mix are combined with an emulsifier. In this case the silica coating acts as the emulsifier to keep the water droplets separate.Also mentioning that it's known among researchers as ""empty water"" adds credibility because if they have a name for it and refer to it in their work it suggests its existence is recognized within scientific communities. The answer provided was ""True "" which aligns with the passage confirming the existence of dry water. There's no indication in the passage that this is fictional or not real; instead it gives detailed explanations about its structure and properties. Therefore the correct response should be ""True.""</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,29.018476199998986,0.009843070332062366,0.002890128119940982,0.021958199999062344,5.653782233942077e-06,1.6600668761974674e-06
48,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether all states enforce a minimum drinking age of 21. I need to check the passage for information about this.The passage mentions that the act did not outlaw consumption by those under 21 but just its purchase. Then it says some states like Alabama Indiana etc. extended the law into an outright ban. So in these states they have a drinking age of 21 because the law was made stricter to prohibit underage drinking entirely.But then there's another part that talks about most states permitting underage consumption under certain circumstances. It lists several states where private consumption is allowed with family members present. This means those states don't enforce a strict ban on underage drinking even though purchase might be restricted by federal standards (which are 21). So the key point here is whether all states have a minimum drinking age of 21. The passage says that while some states extended it to an outright ban most still permit underage consumption in certain situations. That implies not all states enforce 21 as their absolute minimum for alcohol consumption. Some allow it under specific conditions.Also the act doesn't criminalize religious occasions where minors might drink. So even if there's a law against it elsewhere exceptions exist. Therefore since some states permit underage drinking in certain contexts they don't strictly enforce 21 everywhere. The answer should be False because not all states enforce a minimum drinking age of 21; many allow underage consumption under specific circumstances.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,29.12678849999793,0.009877699948158451,0.0029002960882563203,0.03199399998993613,8.372885001881514e-06,2.458451435640574e-06

Let me read through it carefully.The passage says that I-70 intersects a child route called I-470 twice in Topeka. The second intersection involves the Kansas Turnpike merging which makes I-70 a toll road there. It mentions that this is one of only two sections of I-70 that are tolled and the other section is along the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The maximum toll distance costs $17.50 as of 2016 from Topeka to Bonner Springs.Wait so between Topeka and Bonner Springs it's part of the Kansas Turnpike and thus has tolls. But beyond that up to 18th Street in Topeka and extending to the eastern border it's free. So yes there are toll sections on I-70 in Kansas specifically from Topeka to Bonner Springs.The question is asking if there are tolls on I-70 in Kansas.

Then it mentions that it's based on a 2011 novel of the same name by Charles Martin. The plot involves Idris Elba and Kate Winslet surviving a plane crash in the wilderness with injuries and harsh weather including a dog.Since the passage explicitly states that the film is based on a novel written by Charles Martin it's clear that the story isn't true but fictional.

It says that before the 1999-2000 season away goals were used as a tie-breaker after extra time. But then it mentions that this was abolished because Ipswich Town chairman David Sheepshanks launched an initiative after his club lost twice on away goals in 1997 and 1999. After that away goals have played no part in the play-off system.So before 1999-2000 away goals were used as a tie-breaker. The question is about whether they count now.

It mentions that it's her first in a seven-volume series focusing on her coming-of-age journey and how elements like strength of character and love for literature helped overcome racism and trauma. The book starts with Maya being three years old and ends when she becomes a mother at 16. During this time she transforms from someone affected by racism into a self-possessed woman.So the question is whether ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" is an autobiography.

54,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether money from Guernsey is legal tender in the UK. From the passage provided it says that the Guernsey pound is not a separate currency but a local issue of banknotes and coins denominated in pound sterling. It mentions being exchanged at par with other sterling coinage and notes within the sterling zone.So since it's part of the same sterling zone as the UK does that mean Guernsey money can be used legally there? Legal tender refers to forms of payment that must be accepted if offered. The passage says the Guernsey pound is denominated in pound sterling and can be exchanged at par with other sterling notes. That probably means it's recognized as equivalent to UK currency within the zone but does that make it legal tender?In the UK legal tender includes coins and banknotes issued by the Bank of England or authorized bodies like the Royal Mint. The passage doesn't explicitly say Guernsey money is legal tender in the UK just that it can be exchanged at par. So maybe it's not considered legal tender there because it's a local issue even though it's part of sterling. I think the answer here would depend on whether being denominated in sterling and interchangeable with other sterling makes it legal tender. But typically legal tender is specific to each country's official currency forms. Since Guernsey issues its own notes but they're equivalent to UK pounds maybe they are accepted as legal tender elsewhere in the sterling zone including the UK? Or perhaps notâ€”maybe only UK-issued money counts as legal tender there.Wait no. The passage says it can be exchanged at par with other sterling coinage and notes (sterling zone). So if someone uses Guernsey banknotes in the UK would they have to accept them? Probably not because the Bank of England doesn't issue them as legal tender; instead they're part of a currency union. The key point is that while it's denominated in sterling it might not be considered legal tender outside its own jurisdiction unless specified otherwise.So maybe the answer is false because Guernsey money isn't issued by the UK authorities and thus doesn't meet the criteria for being legal tender there.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,30.789443000016036,0.010432107942825137,0.003063081690842841,0.017525300005218014,4.539615615102714e-06,1.3329246160311193e-06

The question is asking if the transmission and engine are the same thing based on the passage provided.First I need to understand what the passage says about both components. It mentions that transmissions are used in motor vehicles to adapt the output of the internal combustion engine to the drive wheels. So there's definitely a distinction here because it refers to adapting the engine's output through the transmission. The passage also states that such engines (internal combustion) need high rotational speeds which isn't suitable for all driving conditions like starting or slow travel. The transmission then reduces this speed while increasing torque. This clearly shows they have different functions: the engine produces power and motion but it operates at a specific RPM range. The transmission adjusts that to match the wheels' needs.Additionally transmissions are used in other contexts like bicycles and fixed machines where adapting rotational speeds is necessary. So even beyond vehicles their roles are separate. Putting this together the passage indicates they serve different purposes. Therefore the answer should be false because they're not the same thing.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,27.60556229998474,0.009363461065198916,0.0027493049639556776,0.01879880001069978,4.77417500175458e-06,1.4017960815687055e-06

It also mentions that a dollar in the mid-70 cents US range was usual for much of the 2010s. So if the typical exchange rate is around 70 cents USD per CAD that means one Canadian dollar can only buy about 70% of a US dollar. Wait but ""worth more"" usually refers to purchasing power or value in comparison. If CAD is worth less than USD (since it's buying fewer dollars) then the answer should be false. The passage doesn't mention any increase in value beyond that point; it just says the rate was around 70 cents for most of the decade. So unless there's a specific part where CAD exceeded USD which isn't indicated here the statement is incorrect.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,27.48819849998108,0.009319968295913078,0.0027365345913700372,0.01425139998900704,3.6638784529619685e-06,1.0757901536534663e-06
57,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is a prequel. I remember that Indiana Jones movies are part of a series by Steven Spielberg. The first one was Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981. Then there's Temple of Doom from 1984. Now according to the passage provided it says that Temple of Doom is ""a prequel to the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Wait does that mean it comes before Raiders? But I think in the timeline the events of Temple of Doom are set after the events of Indy's first adventure. Let me double-check.Hold on maybe I'm confusing things. The passage mentions that Temple of Doom is a prequel to Raiders because it features Indiana Jones reprising his role and sets up some backstory before the events of Raiders. But actually in the chronological order of the movies Temple of Doom comes after Raiders. However within the story's timeline since it references characters and events from earlier adventures (like introducing how he got married or something) but wait no let me think again.Wait I'm getting mixed up here. The franchise has four main films: Raiders in 1981 Temple of Doom in 1984 then Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade in 1989 and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 1997. But the passage says it's a prequel to Raiders because it's set before some events? No actually Temple of Doom is not considered part of the main timeline that connects directly to the next films. The original trilogy starts with Raiders as the first film then Last Crusade and Crystal Skull are sequels. So Temple of Doom was intended by Lucasfilm as a sequel but it's more like an anthology because it doesn't connect chronologically to the rest.Wait maybe I'm wrong here. Let me recall: in the movies after Indy gets captured at the end of Raiders he goes on adventures in Temple of Doom and then Last Crusade. But actually the films are not strictly chronological; Temple of Doom is set between the first adventure (which isn't shown) and the second one. The original trilogy starts with Raiders as the first Indiana Jones film so Temple of Doom is a sequel but it's also considered part of the timeline that leads into the next movies.But in terms of prequel does ""Temple of Doom"" come before ""Raiders""? No because Raiders was released first. However within the story some events in Temple might reference things from Indy's past but actually the character development in Temple is more about his background and how he got involved with Marion. Wait no in Raiders we see him as a married man already. So maybe Temple of Doom isn't part of the main timeline that connects to the next films.Wait according to Lucasfilm's plan Temple was meant to be a sequel but it's not connected chronologically. The passage says it is a prequel because it features events before Raiders? No actually Raiders takes place in 1936-1938 while Temple of Doom is set in 1924 or around that time. So yes the story of Temple comes before the events of Raiders chronologically. Therefore since it's a film that sets up events and characters' backgrounds before those in Raiders it can be considered a prequel to Raiders.So the answer should be True because the passage explicitly states that Temple of Doom is a prequel to Raiders.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,33.82809819999966,0.011475161708907366,0.003369343753214285,0.01798060000874102,4.588160560847932e-06,1.347178411650384e-06
58,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if there's ever been a perfect tennis match based on the passage provided. Let me start by reading through the passage carefully.The passage mentions that a ""golden match"" is when an opponent doesn't lose a single point in the entire match. It says this has only happened three times in competitive tennis history and never in a best-of-five set match. The first was Hazel Wightman in 1910 then two others in 2016 by Tullou and de Schepper against the same opponent Tomas Fabian.Now the question is asking if there's ever been a perfect tennis match. Wait ""perfect"" here might be synonymous with ""golden "" right? Because in some contexts a golden set or golden match refers to not losing any points. So does that mean the answer depends on whether these instances are considered perfect matches?The passage states that a golden match has occurred three times but never in best-of-five sets. The question doesn't specify if it's referring to singles matches (which might be part of a tiebreak) or just regular matches. But since the examples given are from qualifying tournaments which I assume are standard matches without set restrictions mentioned beyond not being best-of-five.Wait the passage says that in these golden matches the opponent didn't lose any points. So if ""perfect"" means no lost points then yes there have been such matches. But maybe the term ""perfect match"" is more commonly associated with winning all games without losing a single point? The examples here are about not losing any points so that's what defines a golden match.The passage also mentions that Tomas Fabian failed to win a single game in five different matches against these players. So each of those matches was won by the player (Tullou and de Schepper) without losing any points. That means there were three instances where someone didn't lose a point which would be considered perfect matches.But wait is ""perfect match"" the same as ""golden match""? Maybe in some contexts they are used interchangeably. The passage uses ""golden match "" so unless specified otherwise I think that's what the question refers to. Therefore since there have been three golden matches (three instances where an opponent didn't lose a single point) then yes there has been a perfect tennis match.But let me double-check. Maybe the term ""perfect"" here is different? Or perhaps it requires winning all sets in a best-of-five? The passage says that a golden match never happened in best-of-five but doesn't mention if those three instances were part of larger tournaments or just singles matches. However since each match (singular) was won without losing any points then the answer should be true.So putting it all together: A perfect tennis match is defined as one where an opponent does not lose a single point. The passage states that this has occurred three times in history.

It says that starting December 5 2016 under the new Collective Bargaining Agreement there's a ban prohibiting players entering MLB for the first time from using tobacco. However those who were already in MLB before that date are grandfathered in and can still use it.Now the question is whether chewing tobacco is banned in Major League Baseball. The passage states that the ban applies to new players but not existing ones. So does this mean that chewing tobacco is completely banned? Not exactly. It's banned for rookies but allowed for veterans. Therefore overall it's not a complete ban across all players.But wait maybe I should check if there are other parts of the passage indicating broader bans. The MLB has taken actions to lower tobacco usage including a complete ban on tobacco with fines. However this might refer more to sponsors and product placement rather than personal use by current players. The specific mention is about new players not being able to use it while existing ones can continue.So the answer should be false because there's still an allowance for experienced players.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,34.5467031999724,0.011720053738818856,0.003441249095563732,0.024245300010079518,6.351306667137476e-06,1.864874411927178e-06
60,"<think>Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is asking if Mickey and Minnie's House is still in Magic Kingdom. I remember that the passage mentions ""Mickey's House and Meet Mickey"" as a walk-through attraction at Mickey's Toontown in Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland. It also says similar attractions used to exist in Magic Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland but it doesn't specify if they are currently there.So the question is specifically about whether Mickey and Minnie's House (which I think might be a different name or version) is still present at Magic Kingdom. The passage refers to ""Mickey's House"" as part of attractions in Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland not mentioning Magic Kingdom directly for that exact name. However it says similar attractions existed there before. I need to check if the current Mickey and Minnie's House is located in Magic Kingdom or elsewhere. From what I know Disney parks have different iterations of such meet-and-greet areas. For example at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World there's a place called Mickey & Friends that includes characters like Mickey Minnie Donald etc. but maybe not exactly ""Mickey and Minnie's House."" The original passage is about Disneyland's Toontown having Mickey's House as part of their Meet Mickey experience. The question uses the term ""Mickey and minnie's house "" which might be a variation or specific name used in different parks. Since the passage says similar attractions were in Magic Kingdom but doesn't mention that particular version still being there I should consider if it's current. However without explicit information from the passage about its removal maybe the answer is true? Wait noâ€”the passage states that similar attractions *formerly* existed in Magic Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland implying they are not currently present. So unless there's a specific mention that it was kept or renamed elsewhere but the question is specifically asking if Mickey and Minnie's House (the exact name) is still in Magic Kingdom. Since the passage doesn't say it exists now there and mentions ""formerly "" I think the answer should be false because the attractions are no longer present as described.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,36.761680799972964,0.012472028947167703,0.0036620445000289685,0.031087599985767156,8.145437219193102e-06,2.391668083455761e-06
61,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if there's still a water crisis in Cape Town based on the passage provided.First I need to understand what constitutes a ""water crisis"" here. From the passage it mentions that Day Zero was initially predicted for April 2018 but got postponed because of increased dam levels by June 2018. The city still has water restrictions until the dams reach 85% capacity.Now as of July 16 2018 the storage level is at 55.1%. Since the restrictions are in place until 85% even though Day Zero wasn't happening that year there's still a restriction because they haven't reached 85% yet. So yes there's still some crisis or ongoing measures to address water scarcity.The question doesn't specify if ""crisis"" means active Day Zero threat or just general restrictions. But since the passage says water restrictions remain until 85% and as of July 2018 they're at 55.1% which is below that threshold there's still a situation requiring caution with water usage. Therefore even if not in full crisis mode like Day Zero there's definitely an ongoing issue.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,35.684403300023405,0.012109878499456737,0.0035557096718433633,0.03549919999204576,9.335545557971475e-06,2.741108396248787e-06
62,<think>Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is asking if Guitar Center and Musicians Friend are the same company. Looking at the passage provided it says that in 2000 Guitar Center purchased Musician's Friend for $50 million. So after the purchase Musician's Friend became a wholly owned subsidiary of Guitar Center. That means they're part of the same larger company now.But wait there's another detail here. The passage mentions that until 2011 Musician's Friend was headquartered in Medford Oregon and then their operations were consolidated into Guitar Center's facilities in Westlake Village California. So after 2011 they're under the same company but maybe not separate anymore? The question is whether they are the same company now. Since Guitar Center owns Musician's Friend as a subsidiary until consolidation even after that they're still part of the same corporate structure. A wholly owned subsidiary means it's controlled entirely by the parent company so yes they should be considered the same company under different names or divisions.But maybe there's some nuance here. After consolidation does Musician's Friend cease to exist as a separate entity? The passage doesn't say that; it just says their headquarters were moved into Guitar Center's facilities. So unless specified otherwise they're still part of the same parent company but might operate under different management or branding now.So the answer should be True because after acquisition they are both under Guitar Center.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,35.27566109999316,0.011974104442397694,0.0035158436130805185,0.03474560001632199,9.17254722735379e-06,2.693248730216826e-06
63,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether any Civil War battles were fought in Florida. I need to check the passage provided for information about this.The passage mentions that there was little fighting in Florida but points out the Battle of Olustee near Lake City in February 1864 as the only major conflict. So yes there was at least one battle.

64,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if minors can get the death penalty. I remember that the passage mentions capital punishment for juveniles was banned by the U.S. Supreme Court on March 1 2005 in Roper v. Simmons. So before that date it existed but after that they couldn't anymore. The question is about minors getting the death penalty now or generally. Since the ban happened minors shouldn't be able to get the death penalty anymore under U.S. law. But wait maybe there are exceptions? I don't think so; usually a ruling like this applies broadly unless specified otherwise.

65,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Beckett finds out who killed her mom. I need to check the passage provided.The passage mentions that Bracken was involved in her mother's murder. It says she was blackmailing Montgomery and his friends for their mobster extortion scheme and killing an FBI agent named Arman. So Brackon is part of a group that committed these crimes. Then there's a tape recording mentioned by Mr. Smith. The question is whether Beckett finds out who killed her mom. From the passage when she arrests Bracken it says ""for conspiracy fraud and the murder of my mother."" So the arrest includes the murder charge. But does that mean she found out directly from the tape? The passage states that Castle helps deduce where the tape is which reveals Bracken's involvement in blackmailing Montgomery and his friends. It also says Bracken admits to killing someone (FBI agent Arman) as part of his mobster scheme. But does he admit to her mother's murder directly? Wait actually the passage doesn't explicitly say that Bracken confesses to her mother's murder on the tape. He talks about having other people killed and mentions her mother in relation to his blackmail victims. So maybe the tape shows evidence linking him indirectly but not a direct admission. However Beckett uses this information along with Castle to figure out the case against Bracken includes her mother's murder as part of the conspiracy or fraud charges.But the question is whether she finds out who killed her mom. The passage says that Montgomery and his friends were involved in extorting drug lords (Vulcan Simmons) whose money was used by Bracken for his campaign. So maybe they set up the killing to frame someone else? Or perhaps Bracken himself ordered it as part of his mob ties.Wait actually the passage says that Bracken had Pulgatti wrongfully convicted for her mother's murder. That means he framed Pulgatti so he didn't kill her mom but was involved in the crime by orchestrating the frame. So Beckett finds out that Bracken is the mastermind behind the murder of her mother through the tape and other evidence.Yes because she arrests him for conspiracy fraud and the murder itself. Even if he doesn't directly confess to killing her mom but arranging it as part of his scheme the charges imply he was responsible.

I remember from the passage that characteristic properties are chemical or physical ones that help identify substances.

Let me check those dates again.From 1966 to 2002 they didn't make it then again from 2010 to 2018. So during 2010 and 2018 specifically they weren't qualified. The question is about the World Cup in 2018. Since the passage mentions that they failed to qualify between 2010 and 2018 including 2018 then they didn't participate in 2018. Wait but maybe I should confirm if there's any other info. The passage says ""then again in 2010 to 2018.""

68,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether North and South Korea speak the same language. The passage says that the Korean language has changed between the two states because they've been separated for a long time. So if there's separation leading to changes in the language then it implies that their languages are different now compared to before the split.I remember that historically both North and South Korea used variations of the same language but over decades apart dialects and standard languages can diverge. The passage explicitly mentions change due to separation duration so yes they probably don't speak exactly the same anymore.

69,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if having six wisdom teeth is rare. From the passage provided I remember that it says most adults have four wisdom teeth but it's possible to have fewer or more. Specifically when you have more than four those extra ones are called supernumerary teeth.So if someone has six that would mean two extra beyond the usual four. The passage mentions that having none fewer or more is possible. Therefore having six isn't impossibleâ€”it's just a case of having supernumerary teeth. Since it says ""it is possible to have none fewer or more "" then yes six is one of those possibilities. So the statement in the question would be false because it's not rare; it's possible.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,32.50246650000918,0.011035218685143084,0.0032401674229374086,0.03841240002657287,1.0439940274117672e-05,3.0653814245793276e-06
70,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if Aslan comes back to life in Narnia based on the passage provided. Let me read through it carefully again.The passage says that after the White Witch kills Aslan by having him bound and put to death at the Stone Table his body is gone. Then Lucy Susan and some mice free him from the bonds. When they do Aslan reappears alive because of a Deeper Magic from before time. The Witch didn't know about this magic since she only entered Narnia at its Dawn.So the question is whether Aslan comes back to life in Narnia. From what I understand he was killed by the Witch but then returns alive through some ancient magic. That means his death wasn't just a regular one; it's reversed by this special rule that applies when an innocent offers their life for a traitor. Since Aslan is considered innocent and offered himself up (even though the passage doesn't explicitly say he volunteered the context implies that) the Deeper Magic brings him back.The key point here is that his return isn't just in Narnia but specifically after being killed there by the Witch's methods. The magic mentioned is from before time so it's a supernatural force within Narnia's creation. Therefore Aslan does come back to life in Narnia as a result of this event.I think the answer should be True because the passage clearly states that he reappears alive after his death at the Stone Table.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,33.47572750001564,0.011365011989461936,0.0033370015275841504,0.024777699989499524,6.412038885496763e-06,1.8827066417238939e-06

The passage says the fourteenth season was ordered on February 10 2017 by ABC and premiered later that year. So yes there is a Season 14. But wait sometimes TV shows have gaps between seasons or might not follow consecutive numbering if they restart after cancellation. However the passage clearly states it's the fourteenth season ordered in 2017 so I think it's safe to say Season 14 exists.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,32.5727748000063,0.011062371658121451,0.0032481400948880653,0.01805330000934191,4.610262225065122e-06,1.3536679153414756e-06
72,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if the answer to ""can I have multiple foreign keys in a table"" is true or false based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage again carefully.The passage says that ""A table may have multiple foreign keys..."" Hmm it explicitly states that a table can have more than one foreign key. That's pretty clear. So if the question is asking whether having multiple foreign keys in a single table is possible then according to the passage yes that's allowed. Wait but maybe I should double-check. The first sentence directly addresses this by saying ""A table may have multiple foreign keys."" There's no ambiguity here; it's stating that it's permissible. So even though there are other parts about parent tables and cascading relationships the core question is whether a table can have more than one FK. The answer should be true because the passage confirms that a table can indeed have multiple foreign keys.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,32.75345310001285,0.011121812613970642,0.003265593183424508,0.04689389999839477,1.244234722334012e-05,3.653329334761583e-06
73,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether cows have to keep getting pregnant to produce milk. I remember that in the dairy industry cows are kept lactating by not letting them go through natural calving cycles too often. But does that mean they need to get pregnant regularly?The passage mentions that to maintain lactation a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves. So breeding leads to producing milk? Wait no. Actually after giving birth cows start producing milk. The process is: cows are bred (to have calves) then the newborn calves are removed quickly. But does being pregnant directly cause milk production?I think lactation happens after a cow gives birth. Once they calve their body produces milk to feed the calf. So if you breed them again soon after they'll produce another round of milk. The passage says farmers start breeding heifers around 13 months old which is before they've had their first calf? Wait no probably they wait until the cow has given birth once and then use her for multiple lactations by rebreeding shortly after weaning.So cows need to be bred periodically to produce milk. But does that mean each time a cow produces milk she must get pregnant again? Yes because without pregnancy (or at least kidding/impregnation) they wouldn't have calves and the cycle of producing milk is tied to calving. So if you want continuous milk production cows need to be bred regularly so they keep giving birth and thus stay in lactation cycles.But wait some animals like goats can produce milk without being pregnant? I think for dairy cows it's necessary because their reproductive cycle triggers the hormonal changes needed for milk production. The passage says ""To maintain lactation a dairy cow must be bred..."" So yes breeding is required to keep producing milk. Therefore they have to keep getting pregnant (or at least impregnated) to continue milking them.So the answer should be True.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,36.39159239997389,0.012346544580210646,0.0036251997061464893,0.020255799987353384,5.327365666906342e-06,1.5642242511446283e-06
74,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if Call of Duty Black Ops III has zombies. I remember that the passage mentions it includes a standalone Zombies mode. So even though there might be other modes like Nightmares which also involves zombies the existence of a Zombies mode confirms that yes the game does have a zombie component. Wait but maybe the question is specifically about having any form of zombies not just the main campaign.

No the passage says Stallone was inducted because he entertained and inspired fans through Rocky Balboa. It also mentions he got a lifetime achievement award but again it's about him as an actor/director not the character.

76,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if I have to pay to watch ITV Hub. Looking through the passage provided there are a few key points here.First the service started as a website and was later extended to TV and other platforms. It mentions that initially it used Microsoft Silverlight instead of Adobe Flash or Windows Media Video. Then in September 2009 they switched to using Flash for their player. In November 2009 there was another revamp improving navigation and visuals.The important part is the funding: ""The service is free to use funded by pre- mid- and post-roll adverts."" So it's explicitly stated that the service is free but supported by ads. Previously users could skip these ads with ad-blocking software but during Summer 2010 they upgraded their website to detect such software. That means now if someone uses an ad-blocker the site might not allow them to watch videos without ads.But does that mean you have to pay? The passage doesn't mention any subscription fees or payment requirements for watching ITV Hub. It just says it's free funded by ads. Even after implementing ad detection they're still relying on ads as their funding method so the service remains free unless there's a change mentioned elsewhere.So the answer should be False because the passage indicates that the service is free and uses advertisements to fund itself.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,34.21357640001224,0.011612444825296116,0.003409652902868113,0.017741700023179874,4.516767222149712e-06,1.3262158574079249e-06
77,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the internal intercostal muscles contract during inspiration. I remember that intercostal muscles are divided into external and internal. External ones help with inhalation by lifting the rib cage while internal ones are involved in exhalation.The passage says the internal intercostal muscles angle obliquely downward and backward from rib to rib and assist in lowering the rib cage during exhalation. So they're part of exhalation. Inspiration is inhaling which requires expanding the chest cavity. That's done by the external intercostals contracting to lift the ribs up. The internal ones would contract when exhaling to push down on the rib cage.So if the passage states that these muscles assist in lowering the rib cage during exhalation then they shouldn't be involved in inspiration. Therefore the answer is False.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,26.13563749997411,0.008863192696609404,0.0026024158703292785,0.01751259999582544,4.525758889697802e-06,1.3288559961399675e-06
78,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if ""log x"" is the same as ""ln x"". Let me start by recalling what these terms mean. First ""ln x"" stands for natural logarithm which uses the base e (Euler's number) approximately 2.71828. On the other hand ""log x"" without a specified base usually refers to common logarithm in mathematics but sometimes it can be ambiguous.Wait the passage says that log x is often used if the base e is implicit so maybe in some contexts they are the same? But I remember that in many cases especially when there's no specification ""log"" defaults to base 10. However in higher math or computer science sometimes ""log"" implies natural logarithm.But according to the passage provided: it mentions that parentheses are used for clarity with log(x) and ln(x) implying they might be different notations but perhaps referring to the same thing if the context is clear. The question specifically asks whether ""log x"" is the same as ""ln x"". Hmm so in standard mathematical notation unless specified otherwise (like using a subscript or writing it out) ""log x"" typically means log base 10 while ""ln x"" explicitly denotes natural logarithm. Therefore they are not the same unless there's an explicit context indicating that ""log"" here is for base e.But wait sometimes in certain contexts like computer science ""log"" can mean natural log. However without additional information or specification it's safer to assume that ""log x"" refers to common logarithm (base 10) and not the same as ""ln x"". So unless specified otherwise they are different.

79,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if runs must be the same suit in Gin Rummy based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully again.The passage says that there are two types of melds in Gin: sets and runs. For sets it mentions three or four cards of the same rank like 8â™¥ 8â™¦ 8â™ . Then for runs it gives examples such as 3â™¥ 4â™¥ 5â™¥ which is a run of three all hearts. It also says that Aces are considered low so Aâ™  with 2â™  and 3â™  would be legal because the Ace is at the low end. But in the case where Qâ™  Kâ™  Aâ™  are together it's not allowed because the Ace can't be part of a high run.The question is whether runs have to be the same suit. From the examples given both sets and runs require all cards to be of the same suit. The set example uses three different suits (hearts diamonds spades) but same rank. Wait no actually in the passage's set example: 8â™¥ 8â™¦ 8â™  â€“ that's three eights from different suits. So sets can have multiple suits as long as they're the same rank.But for runs it says ""runs of 3 or more cards in sequence of the same suit."" The examples given are all within the same suit: 3â™¥4â™¥5â™¥ and Aâ™ 2â™ 3â™  (all spades). So yes runs must be consecutive cards in the same suit. The passage also mentions that a player can form any combination of melds but both types require the same suit for runs. There's no mention of mixing suits within a run or having different suits in a run. Therefore the answer should be True because runs are required to be the same suit.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,27.12359709996963,0.009197896807825786,0.002700691888995462,0.019116799987386912,4.889274445950933e-06,1.435591648301363e-06
80,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if a cougar and a mountain lion are the same based on the passage provided. Let me read through it carefully.The passage starts by introducing the cougar as Puma concolor and lists several common names including puma mountain lion panther and catamount. It says they're native to the Americas with a wide range from Canada to South America. The text also mentions that the cougar is an adaptable species found in most habitats across the Western Hemisphere. Then it talks about being the largest cat in North America and second-heaviest in the New World after the jaguar. The passage notes their secretive solitary nature and behavior patterns like nocturnal and crepuscular activity though they can be seen during the day sometimes. Finally there's a mention that cougars are more closely related to smaller felines including domestic cats than to species of Pantherinae which only includes the jaguar in the Americas.The key part here is when it says ""also commonly known as the puma mountain lion..."" So right at the beginning it establishes that mountain lion is one of the common names for the cougar. That means they are referring to the same animal under different terms. I don't see any conflicting information in the passage. It doesn't mention them being separate species or anything like that. The classification as Puma concolor and being part of the subfamily Felinae which includes domestic cats further supports that they're the same. Also the fact that it's called a mountain lion elsewhere confirms the synonymy.So putting it all together yes the passage clearly states that cougar is another name for mountain lion. Therefore the answer should be True.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,27.557026399997994,0.009350688338330663,0.0027455546283545987,0.019649399997433648,5.0523066624817954e-06,1.4834612639351496e-06
81,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if Comcast and Time Warner are the same company. I need to check the passage provided for any information about that.The passage mentions a merger between Comcast and Time Warner Cable (TWC) which was planned by the Department of Justice due to reduced competition. Then it says that on April 24 2015 Comcast announced withdrawing its proposal to acquire TWC. Afterward TWC entered into an agreement with Charter Communications.So from this I can tell that Comcast and Time Warner Cable were separate companies because they considered merging but then decided against it. Later TWC was acquired by Charter instead of being merged with Comcast. That means they are not the same company. The answer should be False.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,25.038847800024087,0.008498285077790704,0.002495271479935833,0.017362099984893575,4.4261244444189484e-06,1.299601271516375e-06

83,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if I need a visa to visit Oman. Looking at the passage provided it says that citizens of Gulf Cooperation Council member nations can travel without visas. Then it mentions that nationals from 71 other countries and territories can apply for visas online valid for 30 days. But what about everyone else? The passage doesn't explicitly say whether people from other countries need a visa or not.Hmm the question is general: ""do you need a visa to visit oman."" Since the passage only covers two specific groupsâ€”Gulf members without visas and 71 others needing online applicationsâ€”it doesn't address all possible nationalities. Therefore for those not mentioned in either category it's unclear from the passage whether they require a visa or not.But wait maybe I should consider that if someone isn't part of the Gulf nations or the 71 countries/territories listed then according to the passage there's no mention of their situation. The passage doesn't say anything about requiring visas for other nationalities beyond those two groups. So unless it's specified otherwise perhaps people from other countries do need a visa? Or maybe not.The question is asking if you generally need a visa. Since the passage only exempts certain Gulf nations and mentions 71 others where visas can be applied online (implying they are required) for all other nationalities it's possible that a visa is needed but not mentioned here. However without explicit information from the passage about requiring a visa for any country outside those two groups I can't definitively say yes or no.But wait maybe the answer should be ""False"" because the passage doesn't state that a visa is required for all visitors. It says members of GCC don't need one and 71 others can apply online (so they do need to get one). But what about the rest? The passage doesn't mention them requiring a visa either. So perhaps the answer is ""False"" because it's not stated that every visitor needs a visa.Wait noâ€”the question is whether you *need* a visa in general. Since some people don't (GCC citizens) and others do (71 countries) but there are other nationalities whose status isn't mentioned maybe the passage doesn't provide enough info to say yes for everyone else. However the answer choices here are only 'True' or 'False'. The question is asking if you need a visa in general.But looking at the passage again: it says all visitors must hold a passport valid for 6 months but that's about passport validity not necessarily requiring a visa. So maybe some don't require a visa (like GCC citizens) others do (the 71 countries). The question is whether you need one in generalâ€”since there are exceptions where no visa is needed the answer should be ""False"" because it's not universally required.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,30.81305140000768,0.01045144001725319,0.00306875798594553,0.010400500003015622,2.568565559987392e-06,7.541837356023559e-07
84,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if the Falkland Islands are part of the Commonwealth. I need to check the passage provided.The passage says that as of April 2018 Tariq Ahmad was the Minister responsible for the Territories excluding the Falkland Islands Gibraltar and the Sovereign Base Areas. That means these territories aren't included in whatever he's responsible for. Then it mentions Sir Alan Duncan MP is responsible for the other three territories which are probably part of Europe and Americas.Wait so if Tariq Ahmad is handling territories *excluding* the Falkland Islands that implies the Falkland Islands are not part of those territories under his responsibility. The passage doesn't explicitly say whether the Falkland Islands are in the Commonwealth or not but it does mention that he's responsible for territories excluding them. The term ""Commonwealth"" here might be referring to a specific set of responsibilities. Since Tariq Ahmad is Minister of State for the Commonwealth and the UN his role excludes the Falkland Islands. That suggests the Falkland Islands aren't part of the Commonwealth under this ministerial responsibility. Alternatively maybe they are part but managed differently by another minister.But looking at the structure: The passage lists territories excluding the Falkland Islands as being handled by Tariq Ahmad. So if he's responsible for everything except the Falklands then perhaps the Falklands fall under a different category or aren't included in that particular responsibility set. The question is whether they are part of the Commonwealth. Since the passage doesn't mention the Falklands being excluded from another minister's role but just states they're not under Tariq Ahmad's it might be ambiguous. However the fact that he's responsible for territories excluding them implies they aren't included in his portfolio which is linked to the Commonwealth and UN. Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The passage says ""the Territories excluding..."" so if the Falkland Islands are excluded from being part of Tariq Ahmad's responsibility then they must not be part of those territories he handles. Since his role includes the Commonwealth perhaps that means the Falklands aren't part of the Commonwealth under this context.Alternatively maybe the Commonwealth here refers to something else entirely. But without more info it's safer to assume that since Tariq Ahmad is responsible for territories excluding the Falkland Islands in relation to the Commonwealth and UN then yes the Falkland Islands are not included in those responsibilities. Wait no. The passage says he's responsible for territories *excluding* the Falkland Islands as part of his role for the Commonwealth and UN. So if he handles all other territories but not the Falklands under that responsibility does that mean the Falklands aren't part of the Commonwealth? Or maybe they are part but managed differently.Hmm perhaps I need to think about it differently. The passage mentions two ministers: Tariq Ahmad for territories excluding the Falkland Islands (so those territories include parts of the Commonwealth) and Sir Alan Duncan for the other three territories which are Europe and Americas. But the question is specifically about whether the Falkland Islands are part of the Commonwealth. Since they're excluded from being under Tariq Ahmad's responsibility maybe that means they aren't part of the Commonwealth at all. Or perhaps they are part but not included in his specific responsibilities.Wait actually looking again: The passage says ""the Territories excluding..."" so if he is responsible for territories excluding the Falkland Islands then those other territories (which include parts under his responsibility) might be part of the Commonwealth. But does that mean the Falkland Islands are excluded from being part of the Commonwealth? Or just not included in his specific responsibilities?I think there's a nuance here. The passage doesn't explicitly state whether the Falkland Islands are members of the Commonwealth or not but it implies they're not under Tariq Ahmad's responsibility for that aspect (Commonwealth). So maybe they aren't part of the Commonwealth? Or perhaps another minister handles them.Wait no. The question is about being part of the Commonwealth. Since Tariq Ahmad is responsible for territories excluding the Falkland Islands in relation to the Commonwealth and UN it suggests that the Falkland Islands are not included in those responsibilities. Therefore they might not be part of the Commonwealth under this context. Alternatively maybe the Commonwealth here refers to a different set entirely. But without more info I think the answer is False because if he's responsible for territories excluding them then perhaps they aren't part of that responsibility set which includes the Commonwealth.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,35.33686879999004,0.0120033850856372,0.003524441012828929,0.01715829997556284,4.370931116200714e-06,1.2833953739117373e-06
85,"<think>Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is asking if a Quarter Pounder weighs a quarter pound. From the passage it says that the Quarter Pounder is named for containing a patty with a precooked weight of a quarter pound (113.4 grams). So initially yes it was called that because the patty weighed a quarter pound.But then in 2013 they expanded the name to represent a whole line of hamburgers replacing their discontinued Angus burger. The question is specifically about whether the Quarter Pounder weighs a quarter pound now. However the passage also mentions that in 2015 McDonald's increased the precooked weight to 4.25 oz (which is 120.5 grams). Wait so originally it was 113.4g but then they changed it to 120.5g. The name ""Quarter Pounder"" still refers to a quarter pound patty? Or does the expansion mean that all these burgers are called Quarter Pounders regardless of their actual weight?The passage says in 2013 the Quarter Pounder was expanded to represent a whole line replacing the Angus burger. Then in 2015 they increased the precooked weight to 4.25 oz (120.5g). So maybe after expansion some versions are still quarter pound but others might not be? Or perhaps all the burgers under this new name have a patty that's now 4.25oz?But the question is asking if a Quarter Pounder weighs a quarter pound. The original definition was yes but in 2015 they changed it to 4.25 oz (which is slightly more than a quarter pound). So unless ""Quarter Pounder"" still refers specifically to the one that's exactly a quarter pound even after expansion and weight increase then maybe no.Wait the passage says the Quarter Pounder was expanded to represent a whole line of hamburgers in 2013. Then in 2015 they increased the precooked weight to 4.25 oz (which is about 0.28 pounds). A quarter pound would be 0.25 pounds so 4.25 oz is more than a quarter pound. So maybe now the Quarter Pounder doesn't necessarily weigh exactly a quarter pound anymore? Or does it still mean that?Hmm I'm getting confused here. The name was originally based on the weight of the patty being a quarter pound (113.4g). Then in 2015 they increased it to 120.5g. So if ""Quarter Pounder"" is now defined as having a patty that's 4.25 oz which is more than a quarter pound then the answer would be false because a quarter pound is less than 4.25 oz.Wait but maybe they just changed the name to Quarter Pounder for all their burgers in this line even though the weight increased beyond a quarter pound? Or perhaps ""Quarter Pounder"" still refers to the original quarter-pound patty despite the expansion and subsequent change?The passage says it was expanded to represent a whole line. So now when they say Quarter Pounder does that mean all burgers in that line are called Quarter Pounders regardless of their actual weight being more than a quarter pound? Or is each burger still referred to by its original name but grouped under the Quarter Pounder brand?But the question specifically asks if a Quarter Pounder weighs a quarter pound. Since they increased it to 4.25 oz (which is over a quarter pound) unless there's another Quarter Pounder that's still at 113.4g then maybe no.Wait but McDonald's might have different versions of the Quarter Pounder in different countries or times. The passage mentions the expansion in 2013 and weight increase in 2015. So perhaps after expanding the name to a whole line they changed the standard patty size from quarter pound to slightly more? Then the answer would be false because now it's not exactly a quarter pound.But maybe ""Quarter Pounder"" still refers to the original one that was a quarter pound even though there are other burgers under that umbrella. Or perhaps in some regions they still use the Quarter Pounder name for the 113.4g patty while others have the larger version?The question is general: does a Quarter Pounder weigh a quarter pound? Without specifying time or location maybe we should consider the original definition versus the current one.Given that in 2015 they increased it to over a quarter pound (since 4.25 oz = about 0.26875 pounds) which is more than 0.25 pounds. So unless ""Quarter Pounder"" still refers specifically to the original quarter-pound patty then no.But maybe McDonald's continues to offer both versions? Or perhaps in some places they still have it as a quarter pound while others don't?The passage says that after expansion all hamburgers under this line replaced the Angus burger. Then in 2015 they increased the weight of these hamburgers (the Quarter Pounder) to 4.25 oz. So now when you order a Quarter Pounder it's actually weighing more than a quarter pound.Therefore the answer is false because currently the Quarter Pounder weighs more than a quarter pound.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,39.48530830000527,0.013416714503054662,0.0039394236304693495,0.019945799984270707,5.125249443840908e-06,1.5048787664461274e-06
86,"<think>Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is asking if Murphy Brown had a baby on the show. I remember that in 1991-92 season of Murphy Brown there was a storyline where she got pregnant again after having her daughter earlier. Her ex-husband who was part of the cast wasn't going to be involved as a father because he wanted to keep his radical lifestyle. So she decided to have and raise the baby alone.The passage mentions that in the show's 1991-92 season Murphy became pregnant again. It also says that her ex-husband didn't want to give up his lifestyle for parenting. Then it talks about her choosing to have the child and raising it alone. The key point here is that she did become pregnant during the show so yes having a baby on the show refers to giving birth or bringing a child into existence through pregnancy.The question specifically asks if she had a baby on the show. Since the passage states she became pregnant and then chose to have the child it implies that the event of having a baby occurred within the series. The term ""had a baby"" can mean either conception leading to birth or just being pregnant but in common usage especially in TV contexts it often refers to giving birth. However even if it's about pregnancy the question is whether she had a baby on the show which could be interpreted as the child was born during that time.But wait sometimes ""had a baby"" might just mean being pregnant without necessarily delivering. The passage says she became pregnant and then chose to have the child so both conception and raising it are part of the story. However in TV plots especially sitcoms like Murphy Brown having a baby usually refers to giving birth unless specified otherwise.The question is phrased as ""did murphy brown have a baby on the show."" The passage mentions she became pregnant again during that season after previously being a single parent. So regardless of whether she gave birth or not the fact that she had another child (or at least was expecting one) happened on the show.

Then it mentions the modern era's best result as quarterfinals in 2002 and worst results were first-round eliminations in '90 '98 and '2006'. Hmm ""semifinal"" and ""quarterfinal"" are stages before the final so they didn't win those matches. The question is specifically about winning the World Cup. Did any of these results include a championship? Nope just advanced rounds but not the top prize. Also there's no mention in the passage that they won any edition.

That means according to the passage yes Illinois does have it either through case law or other methods.Wait but sometimes ""adopted"" might mean something different from having an explicit statute. The question specifically asks about a ""stand-your-ground in practice."" Since the passage says Illinois has adopted it in some way (like through precedents) that should answer the question as true.

I remember reading that in evolutionary biology terms can be tricky because they're often repurposed.The passage mentions using ""Darwinian fitness"" to distinguish it from physical fitness. It also talks about Herbert Spencer's phrase ""survival of the fittest "" explaining that here ""fitness"" refers to a form (phenotypic or genotypic) that leaves more copies in successive generations. So biological fitness isn't just about surviving; it's about reproductive success.Wait so if survival is being alive longer and avoiding death but fitness includes leaving offspring then they're different.

In many contexts especially in discussions about constitutional rights this usually relates to the Second Amendment of the US Constitution which protects the right to keep and bear arms.Now looking at the passage: It says that the right to keep and bear arms is not legally or constitutionally protected in the United Kingdom. Also most handguns automatic and centerfire semi-automatic weapons are illegal to possess without special permission. So according to the passage there's no constitutional protection for this right in the UK. The term ""right"" here might be referring to a legal or constitutional entitlement. Since the passage explicitly states that such a right isn't protected it means Britain does not have it as part of its laws or constitution.The question is phrased as ""does britain have the right to bear arms."" Based on the passage's information about the lack of constitutional protection and the illegality of most weapons without special permits the answer should be false.

Let me read through it carefully.The passage starts by mentioning that the Hawaiian Islands are an archipelago with eight major islands and other geographical features in the North Pacific. It then says they extend about 1 500 miles from HawaiÊ»i to Kure Atoll. The key part here is when it talks about their former name: ""Formerly the group was known to Europeans and Americans as the ``Sandwich Islands''"" which was chosen by James Cook in honor of John Montagu the Earl of Sandwich.So according to this yes Hawaii (referring to the islands) used to be called the Sandwich Islands. The question is asking if Hawaii used to be called that so I should confirm whether ""Hawaii"" refers to the state or the islands as a whole here. Since the passage mentions the archipelago and its former name was Sandwich Islands it's clear that the group of islands collectively had that name.

It mentions that it's also known as plumber's tape or sometimes referred to by the genericized trademark Teflon Tape.But wait there's a catch here. The passage says that while Teflon is identical to PTFE Chemours (the owners of the Teflon brand) consider using ""Teflon Tape"" incorrectly because they no longer manufacture it under that name. So even though both materials are the same chemically the term ""Teflon Tape"" might not be accurate in this context since the manufacturer doesn't produce it as such anymore.So to answer whether Thread Seal Tape and Teflon Tape are the same: yes they're made of the same material (PTFE) but the branding aspect makes them different. The question is just asking if they are the same not about the brand names. Since PTFE is indeed the same as Teflon then in terms of material composition Thread Seal Tape and Teflon Tape would be identical.But wait maybe I should double-check. The passage says that Chemours considers ""Tef'tron"" a better term now because they don't make Teflon tape anymore. However the question is specifically about whether Thread Seal Tape (which is PTFE) and Teflon Tape are the same. Since both refer to PTFE film even if one brand name isn't used anymore the material itself hasn't changed.So despite the branding issue the answer should be True because they're made of the same substance.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,39.949998399970355,0.013571140585233434,0.003984766307855632,0.04664820001926273,1.2430661110718371e-05,3.6498980514768446e-06

There's no mention of Disney anywhere in these details. The stars include Matthew Broderick Frances Conroy Stanley Tucci Tracey Ullman and Emma Watson but again none of them are associated with Disney unless specified.The passage also states that the film grossed $86.9 million on a $60 million budget and received mixed reviews. But nothing about Disney's involvement. Since the production companies don't include Disney and Universal is mentioned as the distributor it seems like this movie isn't part of Disney.

I need to check the passage provided for information.The passage says that CCBC is a centre of the County Court of England and Wales created to handle claims using electronic media. It also mentions that unlike other centers CCBC doesn't physically hear cases but transfers those needing hearings elsewhere. So CCBC isn't a standalone court; it's part of the County Court system. The passage refers to it as ""a centre"" rather than a separate entity or court building. Therefore even though it processes claims it's not considered a real court in itself because actual cases requiring physical hearings are moved elsewhere. The answer should be False.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,41.11676070000976,0.013973087604336161,0.004102786228819851,0.017387400002917275,4.42185722123314e-06,1.2983483269261902e-06
96,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether a batter gets an RBI on a fielder's choice. I remember that in baseball scoring RBIs are credited when a run scores due to the batter's action but there might be exceptions.The passage says that if a runner keeps going after a misplay (like a dropped third strike or an error) then it's considered a fielder's choice and the RBI is credited. But if the runner stops because of the mistake then maybe not. Wait no let me read again. It mentions two scenarios: one where the runner keeps going so credit the RBI as usual; another where the runner stops but takes off again after noticing the misplayâ€”then credit it as scored on a fielder's choice.Wait actually in standard baseball rules an RBI is not credited if the run would have been unearned due to a defensive error. But here the question specifically asks about ""fielder's choice."" A fielder's choice occurs when a fielder makes a play at another runner instead of the batter. For example a bunt down the line where there are two bases empty and the defense goes for an out at first but allows the run to score.In that case even if it's a fielder's choice (meaning the defense made a decision to prioritize one out over preventing a potential run) the RBI is still counted because the batter's hit allowed the runner to advance. The key here is whether the scoring is attributed correctly. The passage says: ""if the runner keeps going credit an RBI; if the runner stops and takes off again after noticing the misplay then credit as scored on a fielder's choice."" Wait that part might be confusing. Actually in standard rules when there's a fielder's choice you still count the RBI because it was the batter's action (like a bunt) that allowed the run to score. The exception is if the run is unearned due to an error but a fielder's choice isn't necessarily an errorâ€”it's more about the defense choosing another play.So in most cases yes the batter gets an RBI on a fielder's choice because the credit goes to their hit or bunt. The passage seems to align with that by saying if the runner keeps going (which is typical for fielder's choices) then credit the RBI as usual. Therefore the answer should be True.</think>True",True,False,0,0.0,42.86819559999276,0.014573749230853235,0.0042791528500875815,0.031779799988726154,8.34755500779549e-06,2.4510140278281463e-06

I need to check the passage provided.The passage mentions that production of the $2 bill stopped when it was discontinued around 1966. Then ten years later it was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new design. So after 1966 plus ten years would be 1976. That means up to 1976 they were making them again.Now the question is about 2018. Since 1976 is way before 2018 and there's no mention of any reissuance after that in the passage it seems like production stopped long ago. The passage also says low production numbers due to lack of demand but doesn't indicate any recent changes.So if they stopped making them in 1976 then by 2018 which is much later they wouldn't be producing $2 bills anymore.

Then there's Black Ops which I think released later maybe around 2010 or something.Wait the passage says ""The game is also the first title in the Black Ops story line."" Oh right! So World at War introduced a new storyline called Black Ops. That means all subsequent games would be part of that storyline. But does that mean World at War itself is part of it? The wording here might be tricky.Hmm if World at War is the first title in the Black Ops story line then yes it's part of Black Ops. Because the story starts there and continues from that point.

99,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if quantum entanglement can transfer information faster than light. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.Quantum entanglement links particles in such a way that measuring one instantly affects the other no matter the distance. But does this mean information is transferred faster than light? The passage says it's well understood that quantum entanglement doesn't allow superluminal influence or information propagation. It mentions the microscopic causality postulate from axiomatic quantum field theory which implies no superluminal communication through phenomena described by orthodox QFT.Then there's the no-communication theorem which specifically addresses using entanglement between two spacelike-separated observers to send a message. The passage points out that some authors argue this deduction might be circular because the theorem assumes the system is composite. But even so I think the general consensus in physics is that while entanglement shows correlation it doesn't enable faster-than-light communication.To transfer information via entanglement you'd need to send classical information about the measurement outcomes through normal channels. Otherwise without knowing what was measured the correlations don't convey useful data. So even though there's instantaneous correlation using that for communication requires classical info exchange which is limited by the speed of light.The question is whether quantum entanglement can transfer information faster than light. Based on this reasoning the answer should be false because while entanglement allows instant effects it doesn't bypass causality or enable FTL communication.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,42.167835000000196,0.014330017458891045,0.004207588183361954,0.03474239999195561,9.136637779172612e-06,2.68270497684935e-06

I remember that in the passage provided it says Corinthian leather was coined by Bozell for Chrysler luxury vehicles' upholstery back in 1974. It also mentions that despite its name suggesting a connection to Corinth there isn't any actual relationshipâ€”it's just a marketing term.So the key point here is whether ""Corinthian leather"" refers to an actual material or if it's just a brand name created for advertising purposes. The passage explicitly states that the term has no real origin related to Corinth and was made up by Bozell as part of their marketing strategy. That means while it might sound like a type of genuine leather from ancient times in reality it's not an authentic material but rather a label used to market certain upholstery.Therefore answering ""True"" would imply that such a thing exists as a real product or material which isn't the case here. The correct answer should be ""False"" because there is no actual Corinthian leather; it's just a term created for marketing.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,38.827384100004565,0.013180740413427051,0.003870136779009117,0.0218608999857679,5.905240178440529e-06,1.7339001062629144e-06
101,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if tonic water and quinine water are the same thing. I remember that from the passage tonic water contains quinine dissolved in it. So maybe they're related.Hmm the passage mentions ""tonic water (or Indian tonic water)"" which includes another name. It says originally used as a prophylactic against malaria because of quinine. Now the main use is for its bitter flavor similar to grapefruit and often mixed with gin. Wait does it say anything about ""quinine water""? The passage uses ""Indian tonic water"" but not directly ""quinine water."" Maybe Indian tonic water refers to a type that's high in quinine? But the question might be considering ""quinine water"" as another term for tonic water.I think in some contexts people use ""quinine water"" interchangeably with tonic water because of its quinine content. The passage does mention that tonic water has quinine dissolved so perhaps they are the same thing just different names. But let me double-check. The passage says ""Tonic water (or Indian tonic water)"" which implies those are alternative terms for the same drink. So if someone refers to it as quinine water maybe that's another name. However I'm not sure if ""quinine water"" is a standard term or just synonymous.Given that the passage explicitly uses parentheses with ""Indian tonic water "" and doesn't mention ""quinine water "" but since quinine is part of tonic water they might be considered the same.

The top two teams from each group (which are 16 groups) moved to the knockout stage which is a single-elimination tournament. Then it mentions that there was also a third-place playoff between the two losing teams of the semi-finals.Wait so the question is asking if there's a playoff for third place in the World Cup. The passage explicitly states that ""A third place play-off was also played between the two losing teams of the semi-finals."" That means yes there is such a playoff. I should make sure I'm not missing anything here. Let me check again. The passage clearly mentions the third-place playoff as part of the knockout stage setup. So even though the main focus is on the knockout matches leading to the final the existence of the third-place game is confirmed.The user wants a simple answer: either 'True' or 'False'.

Then it says that services restarted in 1893 when two Mexican priests were allowed to restore it as a Franciscan college.

Then in the season three finale they confirmed the premiere date was July 7 2015. But wait Total Bellas is actually another show that's part of WWE's programming structure. The passage talks about Total Divas not Total Bellas. So maybe there's a confusion between the two names? I think Total Bellas might be a different series or perhaps an older name for something else. Let me check again.The passage clearly refers to ""Total Divas"" being renewed for Season 4. It doesn't mention anything about Total Bellas in that context. So unless there's some crossover or the question is referring to a different show I should stick with what's given.

From the passage it mentions that six people died including Ronnie Van Zant Steve Gaines and Cassie Gaines. So those three didn't survive.Then it says the group disbanded after the crash. But later in 1978 they released Skynyrd's First and... Last which includes unreleased recordings from before the crash. Then in 1979 the surviving members (except Wilkeson) reunited for a performance. Wait Wilkeson was injured but not killed? The passage says ""reportedly declared dead three times"" but then mentions he was left in critical condition and that the group disbanded after the crash. So maybe Wilkeson survived as well.Hold on let me check again. The question is about original members being alive. The key points are: those who died (Ronnie Van Zant Steve Gaines Cassie Gaines) plus Wilkeson was injured but not mentioned in the deceased list. Then the surviving members reunited. So if Wilkeson survived and wasn't part of the original lineup? Wait no he's a member as well.Wait the passage says ""including band members Ronnie Van Zant Steve Gaines and Cassie Gaines"" so they were members. Then it mentions ""many of the other passengers onboard were seriously injured including Wilkeson"". So Wilkeson was also on board but not necessarily an original member? Or maybe he is part of the group.But regardless the question is whether any original members are alive. The crash killed Ronnie Van Zant and two others (Steve and Cassie). Then in 1978 they released unreleased recordings from before the crash so those members must have been part of the band then but died after? Wait no Steve and Cassie Gaines were killed in the crash which happened three days after their fifth album. So the original members who survived would be the ones not mentioned as deceased.The passage says ""the surviving members (with the exception of Wilkeson)"" so Wilkeson was injured but didn't die? Then the group disbanded after the crash and in 1978 they released unreleased recordings from before. So maybe some original members were still alive then. But the question is whether any are alive now.Wait the passage doesn't specify current time or how many years later. It just says that after the crash the group disbanded. Then in 1978 and '79 they reunited without mentioning Wilkeson's status beyond being injured. So if Wilkeson was seriously injured but survived then he would be an original member still alive? Or maybe he wasn't part of the band anymore.But regardless the question is whether any are alive today. The crash happened in 1977 so all those who died back then wouldn't be around now. But some members might have passed away later or survived until now. However without additional info on current status beyond the passage I can only rely on what's given.The passage says that after the crash the group disbanded. Then in 1978 they released unreleased recordings from before the crash implying those who were part of the band at that time (before crash) are still alive? Wait no Steve and Cassie Gaines died in the crash so their deaths would be mentioned.Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is whether any original members are alive now. Since the crash was in 1977 all those who were killed then wouldn't be alive today. But some might have survived and passed away later? Without knowing current dates or additional info on their deaths beyond the crash I can only say that at least some members died in the crash.But the passage says ""the surviving members (with the exception of Wilkeson)"" so Wilkeson was injured but not killed. So he is an original member who survived the crash and presumably is still alive today? Or maybe he passed away later but without info on that I can't assume.Wait the question doesn't specify current time just whether any are alive now. Since the crash happened in 1977 if Wilkeson was injured but not killed then he would be an original member still alive today. But wait is Wilkeson even an original member? The passage says ""including band members Ronnie Van Zant..."" so Steve and Cassie were members. Then it mentions other passengers including Wilkeson. So maybe Wilkeson wasn't a member but was part of the tour crew?But regardless if he's considered part of the group (like a roadie or something) then perhaps not an original member. The question is about ""original members"". So I need to check who were the original members.Lynyrd Skynyrd's original lineup included Ronnie Van Zant Gary Rossington Riceland Roebuck and Mark Knopfler? Wait no wait their founding members are usually Ronnie Guitar Bass (Leon Russell left in 1697?) then there was Bob Nesson on drums. Then after the crash they had other members.Wait maybe I should focus on what's given. The passage says that six people died including band members Ronnie Van Zant Steve Gaines and Cassie Gaines. So those three are dead. Then it mentions ""many of the other passengers onboard were seriously injured including Wilkeson"". If Wilkeson was a passenger but not a member then he's not an original member.But if he is part of the group (like maybe a band member?) then perhaps he survived. The question is whether any original members are alive now. Since Steve and Cassie Gaines died in 1977 they aren't alive today. But other original members like Gary Rossington or Riceland Roebuck might have passed away later? Or not.Wait the passage says ""the surviving members (with the exception of Wilkesely)"" so that means some members survived beyond the crash. So if there were original members who weren't on the plane or somehow survived then yes. But without knowing how many original members died in the crash versus those who didn't I can only infer from the passage.Ronnie Van Zant and two other band members (Steve Gaines and Cassie Gaines) are mentioned as dead. So at least three original members died. The rest of the surviving members (excluding Wilkeson) reunited later. But if there were more than five original members then some might have survived. However I think Lynyrd Skynyrd's classic lineup is four: Ronnie Van Zant Gary Rossington Riceland Roebuck and Mark Knopfler? Wait no wait their founding members are usually four or five?Wait maybe the question is whether any original member from before 1977 (the crash) is still alive. Since the crash killed some key members but others might have survived.But without knowing all the original members and their current status beyond what's in the passage I can't be certain. However since the passage mentions that surviving members (excluding Wilkeson) reunited later it implies that at least those who were not killed or injured are still alive today? Or maybe just after the crash.Wait perhaps the answer is true because some original members survived the crash and presumably are still alive now. But I need to check if there's any info on whether they died later or not.The passage doesn't mention further deaths of other members beyond the crash. So unless specified otherwise those who were part of the surviving members in 1979 would be alive today? Or maybe some passed away later but that's not stated here.But since the question is about now and without additional info on their current status I can only rely on what's given. The crash was in 1977 so if a member survived then they could still be alive unless there's other information. However the passage says ""the surviving members"" implying that some are still around.But wait the question is whether any original members are alive today. Since the crash happened over 40 years ago it's possible that all remaining original members have passed away as well. But without knowing their current status beyond what's in the passage I can't be sure.Wait perhaps the answer is false because only those who survived the crash and were part of the band are alive now but maybe they died later? Or maybe not.But looking back at the passage: it says that after the crash the group disbanded. Then in 1978 they released unreleased recordings from before (so members like Steve and Cassie who died wouldn't have been part of that). Then in 1979 surviving members (excluding Wilkeson) reunited.So if there were original members beyond those killed or injured then some might still be alive. But without knowing the exact number of original members at the time of the crash versus how many survived I can't say for sure.Wait perhaps the answer is true because some surviving members are mentioned as being part of the band after the crash so they must have been alive then and presumably now unless stated otherwise.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,64.27361590001965,0.02181987686125585,0.006406765121341159,0.05646120000164956,1.5037742219283245e-05,4.41539074518307e-06

So even though the question specifically mentions ""lice "" not eggs maybe they're related. Lice have different stagesâ€”nits (eggs) lice nymphs and adults. The passage talks about killing eggs with a blow dryer. But does that mean it can kill adult lice as well? I think some sources say that the heat method is effective against nits but not sure about the live lice. Wait maybe if you use the blow dryer repeatedly every 1-7 days until their life cycle ends (about 4 weeks) then yes because by killing the eggs over time it disrupts the infestation. But does the question mean adult lice or all stages? The passage doesn't explicitly say that the hair dryer kills live lice; it just mentions eggs. However maybe the answer is true if we consider that repeated use can kill both new hatches and prevent reinfestation by targeting nits. Let me check again. The passage says ""kill 96.7% of eggs"" but doesn't mention adult lice directly.

The question is asking if ""Lord of all Hopefulness"" is a funeral hymn based on the passage provided.The passage says that the hymn is used in liturgy at weddings and at the beginning of funeral services. So it mentions funeral services as one context where it's used but specifically notes that it's at the *beginning* of those services. I need to determine if being part of a funeral service makes it a funeral hymn. The passage doesn't explicitly say it's exclusively for funerals or that its primary use is in funerals. It also mentions weddings and liturgy which are different contexts. However since it's used at the beginning of funeral services maybe it can be considered part of funeral music.But wait ""funeral hymn"" typically refers to a song specifically composed for funerals or commonly associated with them as their main purpose. The passage doesn't state that this is its primary use; it just mentions one context among others. So even though it's used in funeral services the question might be asking if it's *specifically* a funeral hymn.The answer should only be 'True' or 'False'. Since the passage says it's used at the beginning of funeral services but doesn't specify that it's solely or primarily intended for funerals I think the correct answer is False. It's associated with funerals but not exclusively classified as such.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,50.33645269999397,0.017107769077191238,0.005023193252860514,0.016839399992022663,4.266847776468947e-06,1.2528343622732965e-06
111,"<think>Okay let me check if there will be a 14th season of Grey's Anatomy. The passage says that the fourteenth season was ordered on February 10 2017 by ABC and premiered in September 2017. So yes it did happen. But wait the question is asking about whether there will be one in the future. However the passage only mentions past eventsâ€”the ordering and premiere of Season 14. It doesn't provide any information about a future season beyond that point. Since the user's query specifically asks if there will be a 14th season without specifying time I need to clarify whether they mean the one already mentioned or another upcoming one.Hmm maybe the confusion is because the passage refers to Season 14 as past tense (""was ordered"" and ""premiered""). The question uses ""is going to "" which implies future. But since the passage confirms that a fourteenth season existed in the past (as of its publication date) it's true there was one but not necessarily another. However without additional context about future seasons I can't definitively say if there will be another 14th season later on.Wait noâ€”the question is specifically ""is there going to be a 14th season..."" The passage doesn't mention any plans for another Season 14 beyond the one that aired. So unless the user meant whether the series has had a fourteenth season (which it did) but if they're asking about future seasons then I don't have enough info from the passage to confirm or deny.But looking back at the question: ""is there going to be a 14th season of grey's anatomy"" The passage states that ABC ordered and aired Season 14. So in the past yes. But for the future unless specified otherwise I can't assume another one is coming. However since the user didn't specify time frame beyond ""a 14th season "" maybe they're referring to any occurrence of a fourteenth season? Or perhaps just confirming that Season 14 exists.Wait noâ€”the passage says ""the fourteenth season... was ordered"" and ""premiered."" So it's past tense. The question is about the future (""is going to be""). Therefore based on the information given in the passage we know there was a fourteenth season that aired but not if another one will happen later. However since the user didn't specify whether they're asking about the already mentioned Season 14 or a future one I need to consider both possibilities.But wait the question is phrased as ""is there going to be..."" which clearly refers to the future. The passage doesn't mention any plans for another fourteenth season beyond the one that aired in 2017-2018 (since it's a medical drama with many seasons). So unless the user meant whether Season 14 exists at all but given the tense of their question they're asking about future events. Therefore without additional info from the passage indicating another upcoming season I can't say for sure that there will be one.However perhaps the confusion is because the passage refers to ""the fourteenth season"" as a past event so if someone asks whether there's going to be a 14th season in general (without specifying time) they might think it's about existence. But actually the question uses future tense (""is going to"") which requires information about future plans.Since the passage doesn't mention any future seasons beyond Season 14 being already aired I can only confirm that there was a fourteenth season ordered and premiered in the past. The user is asking whether one will happen in the future but without further details from the passage it's impossible to answer with certainty based on this text alone.But wait maybe the question is misinterpreted because ""is going to be"" could refer to any time in the future not necessarily immediate. However since the passage doesn't provide information about future seasons beyond what was already mentioned (Season 14) I can only say that there was a fourteenth season ordered and aired as of its publication date.Therefore if the user is asking whether ABC has produced a fourteenth season at some point in time then yes. But since they used ""is going to "" which implies future intent not yet fulfilled without additional info from the passage about future plans for another Season 14 I can't confirm that either way.But wait perhaps the user is asking whether there will be a fourteenth season (Season 14) in the series' timeline. Since the passage refers to ""the fourteenth season"" as past tense maybe they're referring to any occurrence of a Season 14 beyond what's already happened? Or perhaps just confirming that one exists.Given all this I think the safest approach is to recognize that the question uses future tense (""is going to be"") but the passage only mentions the existence and airing of Season 14 in the past. Therefore without information about future seasons being planned or ordered beyond what's stated here I cannot definitively answer ""True"" for whether another fourteenth season will occur.However perhaps there was a misunderstanding because the question is asking if there will be a 14th season (future) but the passage only talks about past events. Since the passage doesn't mention any future plans or orders beyond Season 14 being already aired I can't say for sure that another one exists.But wait maybe the user meant whether ABC has ordered and is producing a fourteenth season at all in their history (past). The passage says they did order it on Feb 2017. So if ""a 14th season"" refers to any occurrence of Season 14 being produced then yes. However given the phrasing with future tense (""is going to be"") I think the answer should reflect that based on the passage alone we don't know about a future one.But wait perhaps the user is asking whether there will be a fourteenth season (Season 14) in the series' timeline. Since the passage refers to ""the fourteenth season"" as past tense maybe they're referring to any occurrence of a Season 14 beyond what's already happened? Or just confirming that one exists.Given all this I think the correct answer is False because the question uses future tense (""is going to be"") and the passage doesn't mention any plans for another fourteenth season. However if ""a 14th season"" refers to whether Season 14 has been produced at some point (past) then it's True.But wait looking back at the original question: ""is there going to be a 14th season of grey's anatomy"". The passage states that ABC ordered and premiered Season 14. So if they're asking about whether such a season exists in the future beyond what was already mentioned then without additional info from the passage I can't say True.However perhaps there is ambiguity here because ""a 14th season"" could mean any occurrence of the fourthteenth season (past or future). But since the question uses ""going to "" it's about the future. The passage doesn't mention anything beyond Season 14 being aired so I can't confirm a future one.Therefore based on the information provided in the passage which only talks about past events regarding Season 14 and without any indication of future plans for another fourteenth season (Season 14) the answer should be False.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,56.34225449999212,0.019155787773358808,0.0056245337110992786,0.014060999994399026,3.517787221547526e-06,1.0328947600675485e-06
112,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether a peck is the same as a bushel. I remember from the passage that four pecks make a bushel. So if someone asks if a peck equals a bushel the answer would be no because one bushel is four times larger than one peck. Wait but maybe they're thinking of different units? The passage mentions both imperial and US customary systems so I should check that part again.Ah right here: ""four pecks make a bushel."" So each bushel contains four pecks. Therefore a peck is not the same as a bushel; it's smaller. The question says ""is a peck the same as a bushel "" which would require them to be equal in volume. Since they're different units with one being larger than the other the answer should be false. Wait maybe there's confusion because sometimes people might think of the term differently? But according to the passage four pecks are a bushel. So unless someone misinterprets that as each unit being equal which isn't right then no. The question is straightforward: does one peck equal one bushel? No so false.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,50.922149299964076,0.017321298933309057,0.00508589001523179,0.008172000001650304,1.972190001591419e-06,5.790755921858322e-07
113,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if someone can die from a bullet shot into the air. Let me start by reading through the passage again carefully.The passage says that bullets fired into the air usually have terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they fall back. But it also mentions that people can be injured sometimes fatally because these bullets still fall down and might hit someone. Then it adds that bullets shot at angles less than vertical are more dangerous since they maintain a ballistic trajectory meaning they don't tumble as much and travel faster.So the question is whether someone can die from such an event. The passage explicitly states that people ""can be injured sometimes fatally"" when bullets fall back down. That means there have been cases where bullets shot into the air caused fatal injuries. Even though their speed decreases compared to muzzle velocity they're still fast enough and heavy enough to cause death if they hit someone.I should check if there's any part of the passage that contradicts this or gives a reason why it wouldn't be possible. The answer seems straightforward from the text: yes fatalities can occur because bullets shot into the air have been known to kill people upon falling back.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,50.042769799998496,0.017029157325490294,0.005000111223932137,0.028056799987098202,7.293993331323792e-06,2.1416666266067403e-06
114,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if a cougar and a mountain lion are the same based on the passage provided. Let me read through it carefully.The passage starts by introducing the cougar as Puma concolor and lists several common names including puma mountain lion panther and catamount. It says they're native to the Americas and have one of the widest ranges among large wild terrestrial mammals in the Western Hemisphere. The text also mentions that the cougar is an adaptable species found in most American habitats making it the biggest cat in North America after mentioning its size compared to other cats like jaguars.Further down there's a mention about its behavior: secretive and solitary nocturnal or crepuscular but with daytime sightings possible. Then it talks about taxonomyâ€”how the cougar is more closely related to smaller felines like domestic cats than to species in Pantherinae except that only jaguars are native to the Americas from that subfamily.The key part here is when the passage says ""also commonly known as..."" and includes mountain lion among its other names. So right there it's stating that mountain lion is a common name for the cougar. That means they're referring to the same animal under different terms. I don't see any conflicting information in the rest of the passage. It continues to describe the cougar using both terms interchangeably without distinguishing them as separate entities. The taxonomy part clarifies that cougars are part of Felinae which includes domestic cats and other small felines but doesn't mention a different species for mountain lions.So putting it all together yes the passage indicates that ""cougar"" and ""mountain lion"" are alternative names for the same animal.

117,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if the hand ""ace 2 3 4 5"" counts as a straight in poker. Let me start by recalling what a straight is. A straight is five cards of consecutive ranks regardless of suit. The key here is that they have to be sequential.Now the question mentions an ace. In standard poker rules an ace can either be high (so it's part of A-K-Q-J-10) or low (like in A-2-3-4-5). But wait there are different variants like deuce-to-seven where aces only count as high and others where they might count differently. The passage provided explains that under certain rules the ace can be considered both high and low.The specific hand here is ""ace 2 3 4 5"". If we consider the ace as low then it would form A-2-3-4-5 which is a straight because all are consecutive. But if the game uses strict rules where an ace can't be both high and low in the same hand does that matter here?The passage says under some rules like deuce-to-seven aces only rank high so A-2-3-4-5 wouldn't count as a straight there. However standard poker allows this sequence when the ace is considered low. The question doesn't specify which rule set is being used but typically in most variants an ace can be both high and low unless stated otherwise.But wait looking at the passage again: it mentions that under certain rules like deuce-to-seven aces only rank as high so A-2-3-4-5 would not be recognized. However standard poker does allow this sequence to count as a straight if the ace is low. The question just asks ""is an ace 2 3 4 5 a straight"" without specifying rules.Since the passage doesn't mention any specific rule set in the context of the hand being asked about and assuming standard rules where such sequences are allowed unless specified otherwise then yes it should be considered a straight. But I need to make sure there's no trick here.The answer is supposed to be either 'True' or 'False'. The passage says that under some low rules like ace-to-six the ace counts as low and can't be high so in those cases A-2-3-4-5 would still count as a straight if we're using ace-to-six where aces are low. Wait no let me check again.Under ace-to-six low rules aces can only rank low. So the hand ""Aâ™¥ Kâ™¥ Qâ™¥ Jâ™¥ 10â™¥"" is considered a king-high flush because the ace is low here. But in that case for A-2-3-4-5 if we're using ace-to-six where aces are low then it would still be a straight since all ranks are consecutive with ace as low.Wait but under deuce-to-seven rules (which I think is the lowest possible) aces can only rank high. So in that case A-2-3-4-5 wouldn't count because the ace is considered high here making it not consecutive with 2 through 5. But standard poker allows both possibilities unless specified.The question doesn't specify which rules are being used so perhaps we should assume standard rules where a straight can include an ace as low (A-2-3-4-5).

I remember from biology that the gastrointestinal tract includes organs like the mouth esophagus stomach intestines etc. but what about the liver? The passage mentions that the complete human digestive system consists of the GI tract plus accessory organs such as the tongue salivary glands pancreas liver and gallbladder. So the liver is listed separately here as an accessory organ. That means it's not part of the main GI tract but supports digestion in other ways like producing bile. Accessory organs help with digestion but aren't directly part of the digestive tube itself. The GI tract includes structures from mouth to anus so the liver isn't included there.

119,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if a person can have twins with different fathers based on the passage provided. Let me read through it carefully again.The passage starts by explaining superfecundation as fertilizing two ova from the same cycle with sperm from separate sexual intercourses. That leads to twin babies each having a different biological father. Then there's heteropaternal and homopaternal superfecundation mentioned which are specific types of this phenomenon.Heteropaternal means two different fathers for fraternal twins while homopatentials are the same father but still fraternal twins. The passage says that heteropaternal is a form of atypical twinning where genetically they're half-siblings. It also mentions that superfecundation can occur through natural intercourse or artificial insemination.The question is asking if it's possible for someone to have twins with different fathers. From the information given heteropaternal superfecundation directly addresses this scenario. So yes according to the passage such a case exists and is called heteropaternal superfecundation. The term ""can"" implies possibility which the passage confirms as rare but possible through separate sexual acts or artificial insemination.I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Are there any other factors mentioned that might contradict this? No it seems straightforward. So the answer is true.</think>True",True,False,0,0.0,54.59522449999349,0.018635544029732186,0.005471779436065705,0.011749600002076477,2.8878627796075307e-06,8.479359736654343e-07
120,<think>Okay let's see. The question is whether you can buy alcohol on Sunday in WI. I remember that state laws usually have specific rules about when bars and liquor stores can sell alcohol. From what I know some states allow sales every day except Sundays due to historical reasons or religious observances.The passage mentions that state law requires bars to be closed between certain hours on weekdays and weekends. Specifically for Saturday and Sunday they must close between 2:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. But does this mean you can't buy alcohol at all during those times? Or are there other places where you can buy alcohol outside of bar hours?Wait the passage says that municipalities cannot further restrict closing times but can prohibit liquor licenses entirely. So if a municipality is dry they don't sell alcohol at all. But in areas with wet municipalities bars have to close during those specified times. However there might be grocery stores or other retail places where you can buy alcohol even after bars are closed.But the question specifically asks about buying alcohol on Sunday in WI. The passage doesn't mention liquor stores directly; it talks about bars needing to close certain hours. So maybe the answer depends on whether state law allows sales at those times but does it?WI's laws might be similar to other states where bars are closed early on weekends but you can still buy alcohol elsewhere. However without specific info on WI's retail alcohol sale hours I'm not sure. The passage says exceptions for New Year's Eve and DST changes but doesn't mention Sunday sales specifically.Hmm the user is asking about buying alcohol on Sunday in Wisconsin. They might be planning to go out or buy groceries late on a weekend day. Their deeper need could be understanding if there are any restrictions that would prevent them from purchasing alcohol at certain times especially after bars close. Maybe they want to know where and when they can legally buy alcohol without running into local prohibitions.But the passage doesn't directly address retail sales outside of bars. It only mentions bar closing requirements. So unless WI's state law allows liquor stores or other outlets to sell beyond those hours which I'm not sure about but generally speaking in many states you can buy alcohol 24/7 except on Sundays if it's a dry state for Sunday sales.Wait the passage says municipalities cannot restrict closing times further. So maybe they are allowed to have their own rules regarding when bars must close but not beyond that. However does this affect where you can buy alcohol? Probably not directly; the restriction is on bar operations not necessarily retail stores.But in Wisconsin I think liquor sales are regulated by the state and local municipalities might have some control over wet/dry status through prohibiting licenses. So if a municipality allows bars but with specific closing times then after those closing times you can't buy at bars but maybe other places like grocery stores or liquor stores allow 24-hour sales.The question is specifically about Sunday in WI. The passage says for Saturday and Sunday bars must close between 2:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. So if someone wants to buy alcohol on Sunday after 6:00 a.m. they might be able to do so at other retail outlets that aren't restricted by the same hours.But the answer provided is 'False'. Wait why would that be? Maybe because in Wisconsin Sundays are traditionally closed for alcohol sales. Even though bars have specific closing times perhaps liquor stores also close on Sundays or there's a state-wide restriction beyond bar closures?I think I remember that some states allow alcohol sales every day except Sunday. So if WI follows that tradition then the answer would be falseâ€”no you can't buy alcohol on Sunday in Wisconsin.But let me double-check. The passage doesn't mention retail stores or Sundays specifically for purchase times. It just says bars must close certain hours. However state laws often have broader restrictions beyond bar closures. So maybe the user is conflating bar closing with general alcohol availability.Alternatively perhaps the answer 'False' refers to whether you can buy alcohol at a bar on Sunday after 6:00 a.m. but not necessarily from other sources. But the question is about buying alcohol on Sunday in WI which could include any time during the day or night.Wait if the passage says that municipalities cannot further restrict closing times then they are allowed to have their own rules as long as it's within state law. The state law requires bars to close between 2:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on weekends but does that mean alcohol sales at other places can continue? Or is the entire sale restricted?I think in most states even if bars have specific closing times liquor stores or grocery stores might still sell alcohol until their hours. But perhaps Wisconsin has a state-wide restriction against selling alcohol on Sundays entirely.Given that the answer provided was 'False' and considering historical restrictions on Sunday alcohol sales in many parts of the U.S. including some states like Wisconsin it's likely that you cannot buy alcohol at all on Sundays there. Even though bars might be closed during certain hours perhaps they are not allowed to sell after a certain time or maybe liquor stores don't operate on Sundays.So unless WI has changed its laws recently to allow 24-hour sales except Sunday the answer would still be false for buying alcohol on Sunday anywhere in the state. The passage doesn't mention exceptions for retail sales beyond bar closures so perhaps the general rule is that no selling occurs on Sundays.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,61.06407439999748,0.02083169948919604,0.0061166158981687336,0.023424999992130324,6.110525597948582e-06,1.7941761322912473e-06
121,"<think>Okay let's tackle this question. The user wants me to determine if ""anyone"" can give last rights in an emergency based on the provided passage.First I need to recall what the Last Rites are. From my knowledge they're another name for the Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick right? So the key here is whether the administration of this sacrament requires a specific person or can be done by anyone in an emergency.Looking at the passage: it says that because one effect is to absolve sins not previously confessed only an ordained priest or bishop may administer it. That's crucial. The passage explicitly states that due to its role in forgiving such sins it must be given by a priest or bishop. Now the question mentions ""in an emergency."" I remember that in some cases like when someone is dying and there's no access to a priest certain dispensations exist. For example if a Catholic is about to die without having received the sacraments of Holy Communion and Penance/Anointing they can receive them from any person who has been validly ordained as a priest or bishop. But does that apply here?The question specifically asks about giving last rites in an emergency. The passage doesn't mention exceptions for emergencies but focuses on the requirement for only priests or bishops to administer Anointing of the Sick due to its effect of absolving sins not previously confessed. So even if someone is dying unless it's a priest or bishop they can't give this sacrament because of that specific reason.Wait maybe I'm mixing things up. The Last Rites typically include three things: Anointing of the Sick Penance (Confession) and Holy Communion. But in emergency situations where someone is dying without access to a priest there's an exception for administering Extreme Unction (Anointing) by any person if necessary. However the passage here only talks about the sacrament requiring a priest or bishop because of its absolution aspect.So according to the passage since the effect includes absolving sins not previously confessed through penance it must be done by an ordained priest or bishop. Even in emergencies unless someone is a priest or bishop they can't administer this sacrament as per the text provided. Therefore the answer should be False.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,59.581845400010934,0.020359036208588834,0.0059778322267672705,0.013385500002186745,3.322802217897131e-06,9.756431482222914e-07
122,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the common femoral vein is a deep vein. I remember that in medical terms veins are classified as superficial or deep based on their location and function. Superficial veins are close to the skin surface while deep veins run deeper and can be associated with conditions like thrombosis.The passage mentions ""the femoral vein"" being considered a deep vein but it's contrasting that with how some might think it's superficial because of the adjective used. Wait does the term ""femoral vein"" inherently mean it's deep? Or is there confusion between common and superficial?I know from anatomy that the common femoral vein is indeed part of the venous system in the leg. It runs alongside the femoral artery and is located deeper than the saphenous vein which is a superficial one. So even though sometimes people might mix up terms the common femoral vein is correctly classified as deep.The passage says ""the femoral vein"" (singular) is considered deep but it's talking about how some mistakenly think because of the word used. However in standard terminology the common femoral vein refers to a specific deep vessel. So even if there was confusion between singular and plural or other terms the answer should still be true based on general knowledge.Wait maybe I need to check if ""femoral vein"" could refer to both? No typically when we say ""the femoral vein "" it's referring to the common femoral vein. The passage is pointing out a misconception but doesn't change that fact.

123,<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Garfield is a real cat in the movie. I remember that in the passage it mentions Bill Murray as the voice of Garfield and that he was created with computer animation. So even though there are other real animals Garfield himself is animated. That means he's not a real cat; he's a fictional character brought to life through CGI or something similar. The movie is based on the comic strip but in this case since it's animated and specifically says all other animals were real except Garfield that implies he's not real either. So the answer should be false.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,56.120467899978394,0.01918811739684554,0.0056340263542272815,0.02025629999116063,5.135898334103533e-06,1.5080054998896475e-06
124,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if the internal resistance of a battery changes based on the passage provided. Let me read through it carefully.The passage starts by saying that a battery can be modeled as a voltage source in series with a resistance. Then it mentions that the internal resistance depends on several factors: size chemical properties age temperature and discharge current. It breaks down into electronic and ionic components related to material resistivity and electrochemical factors like electrolyte conductivity and electrode surface area.Next it says that measuring internal resistance can indicate battery condition but might not apply under different conditions. Using alternating current at a certain frequency (1 kHz) could underestimate the resistance because higher frequencies don't account for slower electrochemical processes. Then there's an example about how temperature affects internal resistance: a fresh Energizer E91 AA alkaline primary battery has its internal resistance drop from 0.9 Î© at -40Â°C to 0.15 Î© at room temperature and further down to 0.1 Î© at 40Â°C.So the question is whether the internal resistance changes. From this example alone it's clear that as temperature increases the internal resistance decreases. That means yes it does change with temperature. The passage also lists other factors like chemical properties age and discharge current where changes would affect the internal resistance. Therefore the answer should be true because there are multiple instances mentioned where internal resistance varies under different conditions.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,56.380073399981484,0.019282205231384783,0.0056616524797320905,0.020424399990588427,5.245079444850692e-06,1.5400633220621564e-06
125,"<think>Okay let's see. I need to determine if ""The Young and the Restless"" is going off the air based on the passage provided.First reading through the passage carefully. It mentions that since its debut the show has won nine Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series. Then it says it's currently the highest-rated daytime drama. The key part here is about renewals and ratings as of certain dates.The passage states that in June 2017 the show was renewed for three additional years. That means they continued to air until at least 2020 (since 2017 + 3 years would be up to 2020). There's no mention of cancellation or ending the series after that point. The other details about ratings and awards are just background information confirming its success but nothing indicates it's going off the air.The question is asking if the show is going off the air. Since there's a renewal mentioned in 2017 for three more years which implies continuation beyond that time unless stated otherwise later (but no such statement exists) the answer should be false. The passage doesn't provide any information suggesting cancellation or discontinuation after 2017.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,54.569966500013834,0.018663960790867243,0.005480123182240773,0.02276339998934418,5.9490556145900165e-06,1.746765220483487e-06
126,"<think>Okay let's see. The question is asking if ""The Greatest Showman"" is based on a true story. I remember that in the passage provided it says the film is inspired by P.T. Barnum's creation of the Barnum & Bailey Circus and the lives of its star attractions. So inspiration doesn't necessarily mean it's entirely true or factual; it could be fictionalized based on real events.But wait sometimes movies are loosely based on true stories even if they mention being inspired by something. However I think ""The Greatest Showman"" is a biographical film about P.T. Barnum but it takes some creative liberties. The actual story of the Barnum & Bailey Circus and its attractions might have elements that are real but the movie's narrative isn't strictly true because it dramatizes events for entertainment.So even though there's inspiration from real people and events the film itself is not a true storyâ€”it's fictionalized. Therefore the answer should be False.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,51.67470950001734,0.01767752488740897,0.0051904852901068855,0.044804700009990484,1.1870764449284049e-05,3.485500863314788e-06
127,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if the question ""is the cortex of the cerebellum gray matter"" is true or false based on the passage provided. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.The passage says that grey matter is distributed at the surface of the cerebral hemispheres (cerebral cortex) and of the cerebellum (cerebellar cortex). It also mentions other parts like thalamus hypothalamus etc. but those are deeper structures. The key part here is ""Grey matter is distributed... at the surface of the cerebral hemispheres... and of the cerebellum (cerebellar cortex)"". So it explicitly states that the cerebellar cortex is part of the grey matter distribution.Now the question specifically asks about the cortex of the cerebellum. Since the passage directly mentions ""cerebellar cortex"" as a location where grey matter is found at the surface just like the cerebral cortex then yes the cerebellar cortex should be composed of grey matter. Grey matter refers to the part of the brain with neuronal cell bodies and both cerebral and cerebellar cortices are outer layers made up of this grey matter.I don't see any conflicting information in the passage. The other parts mentioned like thalamus or subthalamus might have different compositions but the cortex itself is clearly stated as part of the grey matter distribution. So the answer should be true.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,42.747010299994145,0.014640874905197701,0.004298862330203864,0.018157899990910664,4.566432783220264e-06,1.3407986887603627e-06
