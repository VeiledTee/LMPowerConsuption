0,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the World Cup has ever been won on penalties in the Finals tournament. From the context provided it mentions that penalty shoot-outs were introduced in 1978 but didn't occur before then. The first time a title was won via penalties was in 1994 between Brazil and Italy. Then there's another mention of only one other time which is 2006 when France beat Paraguay. So that makes two instances where the World Cup was decided by penalties in the finals.  Wait but the context also says that after these shootouts they reached sudden death stage. The question specifically asks if it's been won on penalties meaning during a shootout. Since both 1994 and 2006 were shootouts the answer should be true. There are no other mentions of penalty wins in the finals before or between those years except for these two cases. So yes the World Cup has indeed been won on penalties twice. </think> True,True,True,1,1.0,5.169633500016062,0.0016281018957982735,0.0004780442394939091,0.04314619998331182,1.122039777482213e-05,3.294539816535286e-06
3,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if there was a Duke of Sussex before Prince Augustus Frederick. I need to check the context provided.  The context says that on 24 November 1801 Prince Augustus Frederick received the dukedom. He was also made Baron Arklow and Earl of Inverness at the same time in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Then it mentions that after his death in 1843 the title became extinct because his children from an annulled marriage couldn't inherit.  Wait so Prince Augustus Frederick is being referred to as the Duke of Sussex here. The question is whether there was a duke before him. Since he's the one who received the dukedom and it went extinct after his death without legitimate heirs that means he was the first person to hold the title. Therefore no previous duke existed with this title.   The answer should be False because the context states that the dukedom was conferred upon him implying it wasn't held by someone else before. </think> False,False,True,0,0.0,5.3793372999934945,0.00169226272654853,0.0004968831804843102,0.010423500003525987,2.3547666674453972e-06,6.914079785974385e-07
5,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether ""She's Like the Wind"" was part of Dirty Dancing. From the context provided it says that the song is a 1987 power ballad from the film Dirty Dancing performed by Patrick Swayze. Even though he's listed as the primary vocalist and it's billed with Wendy Fraser in some parts the key point here is that it's mentioned as being from the film. So the answer should be True because the song was indeed part of the movie. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,6.739667199988617,0.0021625272031374743,0.0006349625136342407,0.019845099974190816,4.941052220884658e-06,1.4507946691348614e-06
6,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Hope was married to Wyatt on Bold and the Beautiful (B&B). I need to check the context provided.  First in the story Wyatt proposes to Hope with the HFTF diamond on his mother's yacht. She accepts because she realizes Liam was a fantasy and Wyatt is her true love. So they get married there. Then later when things go wrong with Quinn causing a miscarriage Hope leaves LA but Wyatt follows. After some time he files for divorce mutually.   Wait the key point here is that their marriage happened on the yacht before she left LA. The question specifically mentions ""on bold and beautiful "" which I assume refers to the show B&B. Since the context describes events from the show (like the photoshoot in Paris Liam's sabotage) it's likely referring to a storyline within the series.   The answer should be based on whether the marriage occurred as part of the show's plot. The context says they married before she left LA so that event is part of B&B. Even though they later divorced the question is about being married during their time in the show not necessarily at the end. So yes Hope was married to Wyatt on the show. </think> True",True,False,0,0.0,8.599675600009505,0.0027959179707970393,0.0008209390846398408,0.021067599998787045,5.301172246600869e-06,1.5565333236160815e-06
15,<think> Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is asking if the dog from Little Rascals is still alive. From the context provided there are two Pete dogs mentioned. The first one was active from 1924 until June 1930 so that's about 8 years ago in terms of when it existed. Then there's a second Pete who lived from September 1929 to January 1946. So both versions died by the late 1930s and early 1940s. The original one was gone by 1930 and the second one in 1946. Since that's over 80 years ago they can't be alive today. There's no mention of any living successors or continuation of the character beyond those times. So the answer should be false. </think> False,False,True,0,0.0,9.040135499992175,0.002958961411526551,0.0008688119959294588,0.024359500006539747,6.109129447819821e-06,1.7937661938664808e-06
1,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Meredith has a baby in Grey's Anatomy based on the provided context.  First I'll read through the context carefully. It says Meredith moves to the completed dream home and sells her house to Alex. He buys it but keeps up with her tradition of helping strays. Then Meredith gets pregnant via C-section because she diagnoses herself with DIC during surgery. The obstetrician is called away so Shane Ross finishes stitching her. After that they remove her spleen (Bailey saves her life) and then Meredith names their son Bailey.  So the key points here are: Meredith has a baby through C-section the baby's name is Bailey and the doctor who saved her by removing her spleen is named Bailey. The intern Shane Ross was involved in closing her up after the callaway surgeon left.   The question is whether Meredith has a baby in Grey's Anatomy. Since the context describes events within the show (like C-sections surgeries and character interactions) it implies that this storyline happens there. So yes she gives birth to a son named Bailey which confirms she had a baby as part of the plot. </think> True,True,True,1,1.0,11.577592299989192,0.003814291864820175,0.001119954628412084,0.03380770000512712,9.023884146061314e-06,2.6495981885519027e-06
4,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the UEFA Champions League Final is one game. I remember that the context provided mentions it as ""the final match of the 2017-18 season."" So in this case for each season there's only one final match. That makes sense because a tournament usually has a single championship game to determine the winner.  But wait sometimes tournaments have two legs or multiple matches like semi-finals and finals. However the Champions League Final is typically just one match between the two remaining teams from the semi-finals. The context doesn't mention any other games related to the final itself; it's clear that this specific event was a single game played at Olimpiyskiy Stadium on May 26 2018.  Also looking back at the structure of the Champions League after the quarter-finals and semi-finals (which are two-legged knockout matches) the winners meet in one decisive match. So each season's final is a single game. The context doesn't contradict this; it just describes that particular year's final as being between Real Madrid and Liverpool.  Therefore based on standard tournament structure and the given context the answer should be True. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,12.330331299977843,0.004074500206289899,0.0011963571552004186,0.06416859998716973,1.7044141171972368e-05,5.004510789779154e-06
8,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether there is a Line of Duty Series 4. I need to check the provided context for this information.  Looking at the context it says ""The fourth series... began broadcasting on 26 March 2017..."" So that directly mentions Series 4 exists and started in 2017. The details about characters and episodes also confirm it's part of the show. There's no conflicting info here.   I should make sure there's nothing else in the context that might contradict this but everything points to Series 4 being a real part of Line of Duty. So the answer is definitely True. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,14.160350599995581,0.004692235319899408,0.0013777369038244138,0.04075440001906827,1.0659202225279942e-05,3.129761248080439e-06
9,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Leslie Knope wins the City Council election based on the provided context.  First I'll go through the context step by step to find relevant information. It starts with ""The final results are in and Bobby is declared the winner..."" So initially it seems like Bobby won. But then Ben says that a small margin might trigger a recount. Leslie goes missing but Ron finds her in the council chambers where she's upset about letting friends down.  Then after the recount it mentions: ""Leslie has won to Leslie's overwhelmed jubilation and Jerry's (and Bobby's) relief."" So even though Bobby was declared the winner first the recount confirms Leslie as the winner. That means despite the initial confusion Leslie ends up winning.   Also later in the context there's a mention of Ann getting back together with Tom but that doesn't affect Leslie's election outcome. The key points are the final results after the recount showing Leslie won. So the answer should be True. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,14.397714399994584,0.004771443681447968,0.0014009941096883468,0.020451100019272417,5.063200557520355e-06,1.4866599358255727e-06
11,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Johnson & Wales University (JWU) is a for-profit school based on the provided context.  First I'll look at the context given. It says JWU is an American private nonprofit co-educational career-oriented university. So right there it explicitly mentions that it's a nonprofit institution.   The user wants me to answer only with 'True' or 'False' so no need for extra explanation unless they ask. But I should make sure the context doesn't have any conflicting information. The rest of the text talks about its campuses and founding as a business school but nothing contradicts the nonprofit status mentioned at the beginning.  Also the user emphasized being thorough in analysis but keeping the answer concise. They don't want me to overcomplicate or go in circles. So even though I need to check all details the key point is that JWU is described as a nonprofit university.   No other parts of the context suggest it's for-profit. The founding by two individuals doesn't change its status unless specified otherwise. Since the answer should be based solely on the provided text and the main classification here is nonprofit I can confidently say False. </think> False,False,True,0,0.0,16.87759470002493,0.005651288342335451,0.001659334618272121,0.07644710000022314,2.0336271137042495e-05,5.971147933024674e-06

I remember that the context says these games are enhanced remakes of Pokémon Yellow and part of the main Pokémon RPG series for Switch. Spin-offs usually mean they're separate from the main storyline but still related. Since this game is part of the main series it shouldn't be considered a spin-off. The answer should be False. </think> False,False,False,1,1.0,17.992110599996522,0.006034382098017507,0.0017718188329042162,0.018893100001150742,4.631518885920134e-06,1.3599093086466728e-06
13,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" was written for Top Gun. From the context provided it mentions that Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson had over 300 songs but nothing satisfied them after testing against dailies. Then they asked Giorgio Moroder to write something with Tom Whitlock's help leading to ""Danger Zone."" The key part here is that Moroder was specifically commissioned by the producers to create a song for the film because none of the existing ones worked.  Wait but the question says ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" instead. I know there are two songs: one is ""Danger Zone "" and another might be ""Highway to the Danger Zone."" The context only talks about ""Danger Zone"" being written for Top Gun. There's a famous song called ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" which is actually a remix of ""Danger Zone"" by Frankie Valli but was that created specifically for the movie?   Looking back at the context: it says they asked Moroder to write something and he composed ""Danger Zone."" Then Columbia Records requested him to perform it with an artist. The original song in question here is just called ""Danger Zone "" not the title including ""Highway."" So unless the context mentions that ""Highway"" was part of the initial composition or a different track entirely which it doesn't then probably the answer is no.   But wait maybe the user confused the two songs. The original song written for Top Gun was ""Danger Zone "" and later there's a version called ""Highway to the Danger Zone."" So unless the context says that ""Highway"" was part of the process or another track it wasn't written for the film.

So that definitely confirms there was a second season.   Wait but just to be thorough I should make sure there's no trick here. The user might have mentioned seasons or episodes differently. Let me scan through again. The first series premiered in 2011 then it mentions ""A second series aired in 2013.""

16,<think> Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is asking if anyone has climbed the North Face of Everest. The context mentions that George Mallory's body was found there and describes it as dangerous with a quote about a slip meaning death.  Hmm so the North Face being mentioned here refers to the northern side of Mount Everest. I know that Everest has two main routes: the South Col route which is more commonly climbed by Sherpas and climbers from Nepal and then there's another side called the North Face or North Ridge usually approached from Tibet.   The context says George Mallory was found on the North face. He died in 1924 during an expedition attempt. But did he climb it? The fact that his body was found there might suggest he tried to reach the summit via that route but didn't succeed. So maybe no one actually climbed it then or at least not successfully reached the top through that side.  Wait I remember that after Mallory's death other climbers continued trying different routes. The successful first ascent by Hillary and Norgay was from the South Col. Later expeditions might have used the North Face as well. But does the context provide any info on whether someone did climb it? It just says his body was found there without confirming if he actually reached the summit via that route.  So based solely on this context we don't know for sure if anyone climbed the North Face successfully. The answer would be False because the provided information doesn't confirm a successful climb. </think> False,False,True,0,0.0,22.051078799995594,0.00741303980375692,0.0021766211220996794,0.047847800015006214,1.062929944988961e-05,3.1209811775227426e-06
18,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if Salt Lake City is the biggest city in Utah. I need to check the context provided for that information.  Looking at the context it says Salt Lake City is the capital and most populous municipality of Utah. Then there are population figures from 2014: about 190 884 people in the city itself. The metropolitan area has around 1.15 million residents. But the main point here is whether Salt Lake City is the largest city by population.  The context mentions that Salt Lake City is the most populous municipality in Utah. That means it's a city with official status and its own population count which is higher than any other cities or towns in Utah. The term ""municipality"" refers to an incorporated town or city so Salt Lake City being the largest municipality implies it has the highest population among all cities in the state.  The combined statistical area includes neighboring regions like Ogden and Provo totaling over 2.4 million people. But that's a broader region combining multiple areas. The question is about the biggest city within Utah not the entire metropolitan area or combined stats. So even though the metro area population is larger than some other urban centers in the state (like the one including Reno) Salt Lake City itself as a municipality has more residents.  Therefore based on the context stating it's the most populous municipality the answer should be True. </think> True",True,False,0,0.0,23.605861299991375,0.007941693292627157,0.0023318446714948255,0.0353107999835629,9.22804888476902e-06,2.709545159622251e-06
2,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Air Force One flies with a fighter escort. The context provided says that ""The Air Force usually does not have fighter aircraft escort the presidential aircraft over the United States but it has occurred..."" So they mention two things here: usual practice and exceptions.  First I need to focus on the answer being just 'True' or 'False'. The user wants a straightforward response without any extra explanation. But wait the instruction says to be thorough in analysis even though the answer is one word. Hmm maybe there's a trick here. Let me break it down.  The context states that ""usually"" they do not have fighter escorts over the US. However it also mentions an exception during the attack on the World Trade Center. So does this mean sometimes they do? The question doesn't specify usual or exceptional cases; it just asks if Air Force One flies with a fighter escort in general.  But wait ""usually"" implies that most of the time there's no escort but occasionally yes. However the answer needs to be either True or False. If the context says they usually don't does that mean sometimes they do? The question is phrased as a simple query without modifiers like ""sometimes."" So maybe the correct approach here is to consider whether it ever happens which according to the context yes during certain events.  But the user's instruction is to answer with just one word. However I need to make sure that my analysis leads me correctly. The key point in the context is that while the usual practice is no escort there have been instances where they did provide an escort. Therefore the statement ""Air Force One flies with fighter escort"" isn't entirely false because it does happen sometimes. But the question might be interpreted as whether it's a standard procedure or not.  Wait but the context says ""usually does not "" which implies that sometimes yes. So if someone asks ""does Air Force One fly with fighter escort?"" and the answer is that they do sometimes then technically True because the exception exists. However maybe the user expects the usual case to be considered as the norm. But according to the instruction I should base my answer on the context provided.  The context explicitly states an example where it did occur during 9/11. So even though usually they don't there are times when they do. Therefore answering True is correct because the question doesn't specify ""usually"" or ""typically "" just whether it happens at all. </think> True",True,False,0,0.0,28.501336299988907,0.009610247867266226,0.002821766650423746,0.026318699994590133,6.675174441220911e-06,1.9599686588891532e-06
7,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether days get longer or shorter at the Equator. From the context provided it says that ""the daytime length at the Equator remains 12 hours in all seasons."" So no matter what season it is like winter or summer the day stays around 12 hours long.

The context mentions King Willem-Alexander being around 890th in line to the British throne which means he's related through some family connection or marriage not that his country is part of another.  So the Netherlands and the UK are two distinct countries with their own governments and monarchies. Even though they share a similar form of government each has its own constitution and sovereignty. The fact that someone from the Netherlands is in line for the British throne doesn't imply political union or inclusion. It's just about lineage.

17,"<think> Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is asking if Glenn died in Season 6 of The Walking Dead.  First I need to recall what happened in that season. Season 6 starts with Rick and his group being captured by Negan's Saviors. In the episode ""The Hill"" which is part of Season 6 Negan kills a member of Rick's group every week until they surrender or he has killed enough people. But did he kill Glenn? Let me think... The context provided mentions that in the seventh season premiere Negan beats Abraham and then later Glenn. So if Glenn was still alive in Season 7 that means he must have survived Season 6.  Wait let's check specific episodes from Season 6. I remember that during Season 6 when they're at the Hill Negan kills several people including Markos on his first week. Then there's another execution where Petya is killed. But Glenn? He was part of Rick's group and got captured too. In ""The Hill"" Negan starts killing hostages from Rick's group. The order might be important here. Let me recall the exact sequence.  In Season 6 Episode 1 (""The Hill"") Negan kills Markos (Rick's ally) first. Then he begins executing Rick's people one by one. But I think Glenn was killed in that season? Wait no. Actually during Season 6 after being captured Glenn is among the hostages. The executions start with Abraham right? No let me correct myself. In ""The Hill"" Negan kills Markos first (Episode 1). Then he starts killing Rick's people weekly. So in Episode 2 (""Always"") he executes Petya. But what about Glenn?  Wait I think there was a mistake here. Let me think again. Actually during Season 6 when the Saviors start taking hostages Negan kills them over time. The first execution is Markos (Rick's ally) in Episode 1. Then in Episode 2 (""Always"") he executes Pety""Wait no. Wait a minute."" Oh right! In ""The Hill"" after Rick and his group are captured the Saviors start killing Rick's people every week. So Negan kills one person each week from Rick's group until they surrender or he has killed ten.  But who was executed when? Let me recall: The first execution is Abraham in Season 7 right? Wait no that can't be. Actually looking back at the context provided says ""In the seventh season premiere..."" so that refers to Season 7. So in Season 6 Negan didn't kill anyone from Rick's group yet because they were still trying to figure out a plan and hadn't surrendered.  Wait but I think Glenn was killed much earlier. No actually he survived until Season 7. Let me check the actual episode details. In The Walking Dead Season 6 Episode 12 (""The Next World"") Rick's group is at war with the Saviors. They raid the Hill and kill many Saviors including Negan's horseman Petya. But Glenn wasn't killed there either.  Wait actually in Season 7 Episode 1 (""The Walking Dead"") titled ""The Day Will Come When You Won't Be"" that's where Negan kills Abraham first with his baseball bat Lucille. Then later in the same episode he beats Glenn to death as well. So if the context says that happened in Season 7 then in Season 6 Glenn was still alive.  Therefore since the event described is from Season 7 Glenn did not die in Season 6. He died a couple of seasons later. </think> False",False,False,1,1.0,33.47319739998784,0.011298278929095169,0.0033174073270157084,0.01774979999754578,4.3529249988043574e-06,1.2781084070952292e-06
19,"<think> Okay let me tackle this question step by step. The user wants to know if the Central Bank of India was nationalized based on the provided context.  First I need to parse the context carefully. It says that in 1963 Burma's revolutionary government took over Central Bank of India's operations there and renamed it People's Bank No. 1. So this is about a specific event in Burma not directly about India.  The question is asking whether Central Bank of India as an institution was nationalized. The context mentions the bank being nationalized in Burma but that doesn't necessarily mean the head office in India was affected. Nationalization usually refers to government ownership of the entire organization or its main operations. Since the event happened outside India and only impacted their branch there it's not clear if the Indian operations were taken over by the Indian government.  I should check if Central Bank of India existed as a separate entity before this. The name suggests it was part of the original bank. If the Burma operation was just one branch or subsidiary then the main bank in India might still be operational under its own management unless specified otherwise. But the context doesn't mention any action by the Indian government here.  The user's instruction is to answer only with 'True' or 'False'. They want a concise response but thorough analysis. The key point is whether the nationalization event directly led to Central Bank of India being taken over in its entirety especially in India. Since the context doesn't indicate that the Indian operations were affected by this Burma incident and there's no mention of the bank being nationalized elsewhere (like in India) the answer should be False.  Wait but maybe the user is confused because the name includes ""India"" and assumes that if it was involved in Burma then it must have been nationalized. However without explicit information about Indian government action or broader nationalization I can't confirm that. The context only talks about a specific branch being taken over locally.  Also considering the user's possible deeper needs: They might be researching historical banking events in India and heard about this incident but are unsure if it applies to the main bank. Clarifying that the Burma event doesn't equate to nationalization of Central Bank of India itself is important here. </think> False",False,False,1,1.0,38.28922700000112,0.012934684764852942,0.0037978897742612246,0.052738600003067404,1.4061527929711282e-05,4.128754129350926e-06
20,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if there will be new episodes of Black Mirror. I need to check the context provided for any information about future seasons or episodes.  The context says that a fifth series was announced on March 5 2018. Since then as of my last knowledge update in July 2024 there hasn't been any mention of another season beyond the fifth one. However the question doesn't specify when it's being asked. The user might be asking now after the announcement.  But wait the context only mentions up to the fifth series' announcement. It doesn't say anything about a sixth or later. So based on the given info there was an announcement for a fifth series but no further information. Therefore according to the provided context alone we can't confirm if there will be more than that. However since the question is whether new episodes exist now and the last known series mentioned in the context is the fifth one (as of 2018) then unless a later season was announced after that time which isn't included here the answer would depend on current knowledge.  But the user's instruction says to use ONLY the provided context. The context ends with the announcement of the fifth series but doesn't mention any subsequent seasons or episodes. So without additional info from outside the context we can only say that a fifth series was announced but there's no confirmation about more new episodes beyond what's in the context.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question is whether there will be new episodes now. Since the last mention in the context is the fifth series being announced (in 2018) and assuming that as of now (current date July 2024) no further seasons have been confirmed or released then according to the provided context alone we don't know if there will be more than five. But since the question doesn't specify a time frame beyond what's in the context perhaps the answer is based on whether the fifth series was indeed produced and released.  Looking back at the context: The show premiered two series (Series 1-2) then Netflix purchased it. They commissioned 12 episodes for Series 3-4 each six episodes. Then a fifth series was announced in March 2018. So as of December 2017 when Series 4 ended the next announcement is about Series 5 (which would be the fifth season). The question now is whether there will be new episodes beyond what's mentioned.  But without any info on subsequent seasons after the fifth series' announcement we can't say for sure. However since the context doesn't mention anything after March 2018 maybe the answer should reflect that a fifth series was announced but nothing else is known from the provided text. The user might be asking if there are new episodes as of now which requires current data not present in the context.  Wait the instruction says to use ONLY the provided context and answer with 'True' or 'False'. So I need to stick strictly to that. The fifth series was announced but no release date is given. However since the question is about whether there will be new episodes now (current time) without knowing if they've been produced or released by now it's impossible to say from the context alone.  But perhaps the user expects a simple answer based on the provided info. The fifth series was announced but not mentioned as being completed or beyond that. So maybe the answer is False because there's no indication of more than five episodes in the future? Or True if we consider that since it's been announced they exist now.  Wait let me think again. The context says a fifth series was announced on March 5 2018. It doesn't specify when it was released or if there are plans for another one. So as of the time the question is asked (now) unless we know that more than five have been produced and aired which isn't in the context then maybe the answer should be False because the provided info only confirms up to a fifth series being announced but doesn't mention any further episodes.  But actually the show has had six seasons as of 2024. However since the user's instruction is to use ONLY the provided context (which ends with Series 5 announcement) then without that information we can't confirm beyond what's given. So perhaps the answer should be False because there's no mention in the context about new episodes after the fifth series. </think> False,False,True,0,0.0,41.91367919999175,0.014237946262092502,0.004180554184220718,0.021880899992538616,4.41753500361099e-06,1.2970792348371505e-06
21,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if you can get a rash from using a hot tub. I remember reading in the context about Hot Tub folliculitis. It mentioned that this condition is caused by an infection of hair follicles due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is commonly found in places like hot tubs and water slides.  The key points here are: the rash appears from using these areas children are more prone because they stay longer it starts as a rash resembling chickenpox but turns into pimples. Also if you scratch or aggravate it it can worsen and spread for months making treatment harder. So yeah the context directly states that Hot Tub folliculitis is caused by using hot tubs leading to a rash.  The user might be asking because they experienced a skin issue after using a hot tub or know someone who did. They probably want confirmation if it's related and maybe some advice on prevention or treatment. But since the answer needs to be just 'True' or 'False' I should stick to that without extra info. The context clearly links hot tub use to getting a rash so the answer is True. </think> True,True,True,1,1.0,43.69655530000455,0.014851449301894084,0.004360691308835606,0.030923600017558783,7.928532225681312e-06,2.3279803112509786e-06
22,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether it's possible to have twins with two different fathers. I remember reading about superfecundation in the context provided. So first I need to recall what that term means.  From the context heteropaternal superfecundation refers to fertilizing two separate ova from the same cycle by sperm from two different sexual encounters. That leads to fraternal twins who are half-siblings. The key here is that both eggs were released around the same time and each was fertilized by a different father's sperm.  Wait but does artificial insemination play a role? Yes it mentions that superfecundation can occur through separate intercourse or AI. So even without natural mating if there are multiple partners involved in insemination at different times twins could have two dads.   The question is straightforward: ""can you have twin with two different father"". The context explicitly states that heteropaternal superfecundation exists and results in twins from two different fathers. It says it's rare but possible through separate sexual acts or AI. So the answer should be true because the term itself confirms this scenario as a biological possibility. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,45.339887000009185,0.01541116117633578,0.004525034239731832,0.018890000006649643,4.699886113748006e-06,1.3799833344294739e-06
23,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Thousand Island dressing is the same as French dressing. I need to check the provided context for any information that directly answers this.  The context mentions a study by Michael Bell in 2010 where they looked into the origin of Thousand Island dressing. They found different stories from various villages and islands including one based on French dressing. The Fannie Farmer Cookbook (1965) supports that third origin story with a recipe using French dressing as a base.  So according to this there's an origin story where Thousand Island dressing comes from French dressing. But does that mean they are the same? Not necessarily. The context says ""based upon "" which suggests that Thousand Island might have been derived from or included elements of French dressing but isn't identical.   French dressing is a separate entity here. It's mentioned as part of the recipe for Thousand Island so it's likely an ingredient rather than the dressing itself being the same. Therefore even though there's a connection in origin they are different dressings. </think> False",False,True,0,0.0,47.768717099999776,0.016252333559334222,0.0047720197712587805,0.026851400005398318,6.818310555212924e-06,2.0019963691534886e-06
24,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if ""melaleuca"" and ""tea tree"" are the same thing. I remember from the context that Tea Tree Oil comes from Melaleuca alternifolia. So the oil is specifically from this species of tea tree.  Now the term ""tea tree"" can refer to several plants in the Melaleuca genus but not all. The scientific name given here is Melaleuca alternifolia which means that when people say ""tea tree "" they're often referring to this specific type. But does ""melaleuca"" mean just the oil or the plant?  Wait the context says ""Tea Tree Oil also known as melaleuca oil..."" So here ""melaleuca oil"" is another name for Tea Tree Oil from Melaleuca alternifolia. That means that in common usage when someone refers to ""tea tree "" they're likely talking about this particular species under the genus Melaleuca.  But the question is whether melaleuca and tea tree are the same thing. The genus is Melaleuca so all tea trees belong to this genus? Or does ""tea tree"" refer specifically to one species?  The context mentions that Tea Tree Oil comes from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia which is native to Australia. So ""tea tree"" here refers to a specific plant (M. alternifolia) within the Melaleuca genus. Therefore when someone says ""tea tree "" they're referring to one type of melaleuca.  But does ""melaleuca"" as a common name mean all plants in that genus? Or is it just another term for Tea Tree Oil? The context uses ""Melaleuca alternifolia"" and calls the oil ""melaleuca oil."" So perhaps ""melaleuca"" here refers to the species not the entire genus. Wait no—genus names are capitalized so Melaleuca is the genus. But in common parlance people might use ""tea tree"" for M. alternifolia and maybe other similar plants.  Wait actually I think there's a bit of confusion here. The term ""tea tree"" typically refers to Melaleuca alternifolia which is part of the Melaleuca genus. So when someone says ""tea tree "" they're referring to this specific plant under the genus Melaleuca. Therefore in common usage tea tree and melaleuca are related but not exactly the same—melaleuca refers to the genus while tea tree is a species within that genus.  But wait the question says ""is melaleuca and tea tree the same thing."" The context uses both terms interchangeably for the oil. However in botanical terms Melaleuca alternifolia is commonly called Tea Tree but other plants like Leptospermum (which are also known as tea trees) belong to a different genus. So ""tea tree"" can sometimes refer to species outside Melaleuca? Hmm.  Wait the context specifically says that Tea Tree Oil comes from Melaleuca alternifolia. But does ""tea tree"" exclusively mean this plant? Or is it possible that in some regions other plants are called tea trees?  Upon thinking I recall that different sources might use ""tea tree"" for both Melaleuca and Leptospermum species (like the Manuka). So if someone says ""tea tree "" they could be referring to either genus. But the context here only mentions Melaleuca alternifolia as the source of Tea Tree Oil.  So in this specific case when talking about Tea Tree Oil it's from Melaleuca. However the term ""tea tree"" can sometimes refer to other plants (like Leptospermum) that are not part of the Melaleuca genus but still produce oil with similar properties? Or maybe just different species.  Wait no—Leptospermum is a different genus altogether. So if someone says ""tea tree "" they might be referring to either Melaleuca or Leptospermum plants. Therefore in general terms are melaleuca and tea tree the same thing? Not necessarily because Tea Tree can refer to multiple genera.  But the question is whether they're the same thing. The context says that Tea Tree Oil is also known as melaleuca oil from Melaleuca alternifolia. So in this specific case yes. But if ""tea tree"" refers to other plants outside Melaleuca then no.  Wait but the question doesn't specify whether it's about the plant or the oil. The context mentions both: the oil is called melaleuca oil and tea tree oil. So perhaps in common usage when people say ""tea tree "" they're referring to Melaleuca alternifolia which is part of the genus Melaleuca.  But technically the genus name is Melaleuca so all plants in that genus are melaleucas. However the term ""tea tree"" specifically refers to M. alternifolia. So if someone says ""tea tree "" they're talking about one species within the Melaleuca genus. Therefore tea tree and melaleuca (the genus) aren't exactly the same—tea tree is a specific plant under that genus.  Wait but in everyday language people might use ""tea tree"" to refer to any of these plants including other genera like Leptospermum. So unless specified otherwise they're not necessarily the same thing because different species can be called tea trees.  But looking back at the context: it says Tea Tree Oil is from Melaleuca alternifolia and also known as melaleuca oil or ti tree oil. So here ""melaleuca"" refers to the genus name used for that specific plant (M. alternifolia). Therefore in this case when referring to the oil they're using both terms interchangeably.  But the question is about whether ""melaleuca and tea tree are the same thing."" If we consider them as common names then yes—tea tree refers to Melaleuca alternifolia. However if someone uses ""tea tree"" for other plants (like Leptospermum) then they're not the same.  But given that the context specifically links Tea Tree Oil to Melaleuca alternifolia and calls it melaleuca oil perhaps in this case yes. But without more info I can't be certain if ""tea tree"" exclusively refers to M. alternifolia or other plants as well.  Wait no—Melaleuca is the genus name for a group of trees native to Australia and New Guinea. The species Melaleuca alternifolia is commonly called Tea Tree. So when someone says ""tea tree "" they're referring to this specific plant under the genus Melaleuca. Therefore in that sense yes—Melaleuca (the genus) includes tea tree as one of its species.  But wait the question is whether melaleuca and tea tree are the same thing. If we take ""melaleuca"" here to mean the plant itself (i.e. Melaleuca alternifolia) then yes. But if it refers to the entire genus then no—because other species in Melaleuca aren't called tea trees.  Hmm this is getting a bit tangled. Let me clarify: The term ""tea tree"" specifically refers to Melaleuca alternifolia (the plant). So when someone says ""tea tree "" they're talking about that particular species within the genus Melaleuca. Therefore in common usage tea tree and melaleuca are related but not exactly the same—melaleuca is a broader term for all plants in that genus.  But wait no—the context uses ""Melaleuca alternifolia"" as the scientific name so when they say ""tea tree "" it's referring to this specific plant. However if someone says ""tea tree oil "" they're talking about M. alternifolia. But does ""melaleuca"" refer to the genus or just another common name for the same species?  Actually in botanical terms Melaleuca is a genus that includes several species. The most well-known one (M. alternifolia) is called Tea Tree. So if someone says ""tea tree "" they're referring to M. alternifolia which is part of the Melaleuca genus. Therefore tea tree and melaleuca are not exactly the same—melaleuca refers to all plants in that genus while tea tree specifically denotes one species.  But wait sometimes people use ""tea tree"" generically for any plant from the Melaleuca genus? Or is it just M. alternifolia?  Upon second thought I think ""tea tree"" typically refers only to M. alternifolia even though other plants in the same genus might be called something else (like paperbark or honey myrtle). So if someone says ""tea tree "" they're specifically talking about Melaleuca alternifolia.  Therefore when referring to that specific plant tea tree and melaleuca are the same. But since the question is asking whether they are the same thing in general without specifying context maybe not entirely accurate because other plants might be called tea trees as well (like Leptospermum species). However given the provided context only mentions Melaleuca alternifolia perhaps the answer here is that yes melaleuca and tea tree are the same thing.  Wait no—Melaleuca is a genus name. So if someone says ""tea tree "" they're referring to one specific species (M. alternifolia) within the Melaleuca genus. Therefore in common parlance when people say ""tea tree "" they mean that particular plant under the genus Melaleuca.  So technically tea tree is a synonym for Melaleuca alternifolia. But if someone says ""melaleuca"" as referring to any plant in that genus (not just M. alternifolia) then no—because melaleuca refers to all species within the genus while tea tree specifically denotes one.  But given the context provided only talks about Melaleuca alternifolia and calls it both ""tea tree"" and ""melaleuca oil "" perhaps in this case they are considered the same. However strictly speaking if melaleuca refers to the entire genus then no—because other species aren't called tea trees.  But I think the question is likely asking whether ""tea tree"" and ""Melaleuca"" (the plant) refer to the same thing. Since Melaleuca alternifolia is commonly known as Tea Tree yes they are the same in that context. </think> True",True,False,0,0.0,55.23296300001675,0.018796471811766358,0.005519031146400608,0.027374500001315027,5.283052840232432e-06,1.551213092824732e-06
25,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether liquid nitrogen is the same as dry ice based on the provided context.  First I need to check the context for any information that compares them. The context mentions both in relation to freezing and removing warts. It says liquid nitrogen performs better because it's colder and requires less time with less pressure. Then it talks about dry ice being easier to store since it can be generated from compressed CO2 as needed.  So they are both used for similar purposes (freezing warts) but the text explicitly states that liquid nitrogen is different—colder and more effective. Dry ice has storage advantages. The key point here is that while both serve a purpose in cryotherapy they aren't the same substance. Liquid nitrogen is a gas stored as a liquid under pressure whereas dry ice is solid CO2 at room temperature.  The question specifically asks if they are the same. From this context since one is described as performing better due to being colder and requiring less time/pressure that implies they have different properties. Also their storage methods differ—liquid nitrogen needs special cryogenic storage while dry ice can be generated from compressed gas. So even though both are used in freezing applications the text clearly distinguishes them.  Therefore the answer should be False because liquid nitrogen and dry ice are not the same; they have different states (liquid vs solid) compositions and properties. </think> False,False,False,1,1.0,48.63284130001557,0.016560177472340766,0.004862409082674628,0.022609700012253597,5.650291115226637e-06,1.6590418118599022e-06
26,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if Fred from First Dates has a partner. From the context provided it says that in 2016 Sirieix mentioned living with his former partner and their two children but was in a new relationship. Then in 2018 he announced being in a relationship calling his partner 'fruitcake'. So even though he had a previous partner now he's referring to someone else as his current partner. The term 'fruitcake' here is just an affectionate nickname for the person he was dating at that time. Therefore yes Fred does have a partner according to these statements. </think> True,True,True,1,1.0,49.10115949998726,0.016718877226098376,0.004909006598032064,0.024807300011161715,5.106036111020431e-06,1.4992373363243324e-06
27,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if breakfast lunch and dinner are always served in Italy. I need to check the context provided for that.  The context says that the Italian meal structure is typical of the Mediterranean region but different from Northern Europe Germanic etc. It mentions that it often consists of these three meals but there's less emphasis on breakfast which can be skipped or lighter. Also late-morning and mid-afternoon snacks (merenda) are common.   So the key point here is ""often"" versus ""always."" The context explicitly states that while these meals exist they're not always served because Italians might skip breakfast sometimes. Therefore the answer should reflect that it's not a universal practice in Italy. </think> False",False,False,1,1.0,48.87884339998709,0.01664386101787101,0.004886980294700363,0.030890900001395494,8.01551450939285e-06,2.353520100728306e-06
28,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Scar is alive in The Lion King 2. I remember that The Lion King 2 refers to ""The Lion King 1 and a Half"" or sometimes just called ""Simba's Journey."" But wait the context provided mentions two things from different movies. The first part about Scar intervening and turning into Kovu happens in Simba's nightmare which is actually in the original ""The Lion King"" movie (part one). Then there's another cameo where Scar appears as a reflection in water after Kovu is exiled.  So the context doesn't talk about any sequel or second movie. The Lion King 2 isn't a thing; Disney released two movies but they're part one and part two. Part two is ""The Lion King Returns"" which I think was later renamed to ""The Legend of Scar."" Wait no that's actually an animated series continuation. But the question specifically says ""The Lion King 2 "" so maybe it's referring to a movie called The Lion King 2: Simba's Dangerous Journey or something else? Hmm but according to my knowledge there isn't a widely known movie titled exactly that. There was a direct-to-video film called ""Simba's Magic"" and others but the main sequels are the two movies released in 1998 and 2004.  The context provided is from the original Lion King (part one) where Scar dies at the end when he's thrown into the volcano. So even though there might be some confusion with titles or continuations the information given states that Scar appears as a reflection after Kovu's exile which would still be in part one. Therefore in any direct sequel movies like The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (which is actually titled differently) Scar isn't alive because he was killed in the first movie.  Wait but maybe ""The Lion King 2"" refers to a different film entirely? Let me check that. There's a movie called ""The Lion Guard"" which is part of The Lion King franchise but that's animated and set after the original events. However Scar isn't alive there either because he died in the first movie. So regardless if the context provided is from the original film where Scar dies then even though he might appear as a reflection or spirit he's not considered alive in any continuation.  Therefore the answer should be False. </think> False",False,False,1,1.0,54.046613600017736,0.018399216973143926,0.005402388946238177,0.04660339999827556,1.0894812777890668e-05,3.198941357587227e-06
29,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if cowpeas and black-eyed peas are the same thing. I remember from the context that cultivated cowpeas have common names including ""black-eyed pea "" among others like southern pea yardlong bean etc. So since one of their names is black-eyed pea they must be the same plant.  Wait but maybe there's a trick here. Sometimes different plants can share similar common names. The context says cowpeas are known as black-eyed peas so that directly links them. Also mentions they were domesticated in Africa and had another event in Asia before spreading elsewhere. No mention of other species being called black-eyed peas differently.  Yeah the answer should be true because the context explicitly states that cultivated cowpeas include ""black-eyed pea"" as a common name. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,51.86676599999191,0.01765601399580962,0.005184169249420498,0.029934799997135997,7.650882775487844e-06,2.2464567158260373e-06
30,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the Isle of Man is part of the European Economic Area (EEA). I remember that the context provided says the Isle of Man holds neither membership nor associate membership of the EU and lies outside the EEA. But there's a mention of Protocol 3 allowing trade without non-EU tariffs which facilitates free trade with the UK through the Customs and Excise agreement.  Hmm so even though they can move goods freely within the EEA under this protocol that doesn't necessarily mean the Isle of Man is part of it. The key point here is whether being outside the EU but having such a protocol means membership in the EEA. I think the EEA includes countries that are part of the EU through an associate membership or direct membership. Since the Isle of Man isn't a member state and doesn't have associate membership they're not part of the EEA even though some trade is allowed.  Wait but Protocol 3 might be part of the EEA agreement? Or maybe it's separate. The context says that despite being outside the EEA Protocol 3 permits tariff-free trade with the UK via a different agreement. So if the Isle of Man isn't in the EEA then they're not part of it. Even though goods can be moved freely within the EEA under certain protocols the Isle of Man's status is separate.

The context provided says that during the credits Louie emerges from the rubble and performs ""I Wan'na Be like You"" with modified lyrics.  First I need to recall what happens in the 2016 Jungle Book movie. In Disney's 2016 version of The Jungle Book King Louie is brought down by a falling tree after Shere Khan attacks him because he tried to steal the man-cub's roar. So yes he dies at the end.  But wait the context mentions that during the credits Louie emerges from the rubble and performs the song with modified lyrics. That seems contradictory to what I remember. Let me double-check. Actually in the 2016 film after King Louie is defeated by the falling tree he does appear at the end of the credits scene but that's just a visual gag or a fun ending touch. He doesn't actually perform again because his death was already shown earlier.  So even though there's a credit scene where he emerges and maybe makes a joke about performing in reality King Louie died during the main plot. The answer should be False because he did die in the movie. </think> False",False,False,1,1.0,57.506115500000305,0.019587859790790738,0.0057513989518516535,0.03676610000547953,9.541501115341413e-06,2.8015811885516187e-06
32,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if Dwyane Wade made the playoffs his rookie year. I remember that he was drafted 5th overall by the Miami Heat in 2003. Looking at the context it says after a 5-15 start the team improved and finished with a 42-40 record to qualify for the NBA playoffs. So yes they made the playoffs because of that win-loss record.  Then it mentions he had outstanding playoff performances against the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals. Wait but the question is about his rookie year specifically. The context also states that after a poor start the team improved enough to make the playoffs. Since Wade was part of that team and they qualified for the playoffs as rookies (including him) he definitely made the playoffs during his first season.  I don't see any conflicting information here. Even though later in the text it talks about how his rookie success was overshadowed by other rookies but the key point is that the Heat qualified for the playoffs after their initial poor performance. So Wade's team did make the playoffs as a rookie meaning he participated in them too. </think> True,True,False,0,0.0,58.67551370000001,0.019994395104322025,0.005870766090533839,0.04174990000319667,1.0981149491438123e-05,3.2242915943719834e-06
33,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the dorsal root ganglion carries sensory input. From the context provided it says that a dorsal root ganglion is a cluster of neurons in the dorsal root of a spinal nerve and that the cell bodies of sensory neurons (first-order neurons) are located there.  Hmm so the key points here are: the DRG contains sensory neuron cell bodies. These sensory neurons are responsible for carrying information from the periphery to the central nervous system. Since they're first-order neurons in the dorsal root which is part of the spinal nerve that handles sensory functions (like touch and pain) it makes sense that the ganglion itself isn't just a carrier but houses the cells that process or transmit that input.  Wait the question specifically asks if the DRG carries sensory input. Carrying usually refers to transmission through neurons. But in this case the cell bodies are there; they're part of the sensory neurons. So maybe the answer is yes because those neurons carry the input and their bodies are in the ganglion. However sometimes people might think that the ganglion itself transmits the signals but actually it's more about housing the neurons whose axons carry the input.  But let me double-check. The context says ""the cell bodies of sensory neurons... are located here."" So the DRG contains these sensory neurons' cell bodies. These neurons then send their axons (which exit from the ganglion) into the spinal cord to carry the sensory information. Therefore while the ganglion itself isn't a nerve carrying signals but rather a collection of cells that form part of the pathway those cells are responsible for carrying the input. So maybe the answer is True because it's where the sensory neurons' cell bodies are located and they carry the input.  Wait sometimes people might confuse whether the DRG transmits or just processes. But according to standard neurobiology the dorsal root ganglion contains the cell bodies of primary sensory neurons that receive peripheral stimuli and their axons (dorsal roots) carry that information into the spinal cord. So yes they do carry sensory input through their axons. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,63.05450919998111,0.02149380870251554,0.00631102479613764,0.03845769999315962,9.961606108117848e-06,2.9249326644621217e-06
34,"<think> Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is asking whether England has ever won the FIFA Women's World Cup. I need to check the provided context for any information about that.  Looking at the context again: ""England have qualified for the FIFA Women's World Cup four times reaching the quarter final stage on the first three occasions in 1995 2007 and 2011 and finishing third in 2015. They reached the final of the UEFA Women's Championship in 1984 and 2009.""  So England qualified four times for the World Cup. The first three (1995 2007 2011) went to the quarterfinals. In 2015 they finished third. That means their best result in those World Cups was reaching the quarterfinals or being third. Winning would be mentioned if they did it but here they didn't. The mention of the UEFA final is separate from the FIFA World Cup.  I don't see any statement that England won the World Cup. They qualified multiple times and reached stages like quarterfinals and a third-place finish but not a win. So the answer should be False. </think> False",False,True,0,0.0,61.84165879999637,0.021092557136845318,0.006193209074620708,0.020459200022742152,5.1058155587977824e-06,1.499172577650556e-06
35,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether finding a four-leaf clover is considered lucky based on the provided context.  First I'll go through each part of the context. It starts by saying that the four-leaf clover is rare and according to traditional superstition brings good luck. But then it mentions that it's not clear when or how this started. The earliest mention in 1640 talks about using it for medicinal purposes like treating purples (probably a typo for purple) in children. Then there's a description from 1869 where sorceresses use it in spells and young girls seek it as a token of happiness. However the context also says that the first reference to luck is from an 11-year-old girl in 1877 asking if fairies told about its luck-bringing properties.  So the context includes both medicinal uses and symbolic associations with good luck. The direct answer comes from the 1877 letter where she asks if it's lucky. But I need to make sure there aren't any contradictions or other factors.   The clover is described as a rare variation of the three-leaf one which might imply that its rarity adds to its perceived value or luck. The medicinal mention doesn't directly address luck but could be part of why people noticed it. However the question specifically asks about luck. Since the context explicitly states that the superstition includes bringing good luck (first sentence) and then provides evidence from a later time confirming this belief through fairy tales even though there's an earlier mention for medicinal purposes the answer should align with the established superstition.  So yes finding a four-leaf clover is considered lucky according to traditional beliefs mentioned here. </think> True,True,False,0,0.0,65.70564800000284,0.02243393182175159,0.00658706430123599,0.042731499997898936,1.1192403378566437e-05,3.2863200853853616e-06
36,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if the Mafia is still active in New Jersey based on the provided context.  Looking at the context it mentions the DeCavalcante crime family operating in Elizabeth New Jersey and surrounding areas. It also says they are part of the American Mafia (Cosa Nostra). So there's a direct statement that this family exists in NJ as part of the Mafia.   The question is about whether the Mafia is still active. The context doesn't give an end date for their operations but does mention ongoing activities like bookmaking drug trafficking etc. which are typical Mafia things. Also they're referenced in TV shows and documentaries that aired after certain periods (like 2010) so maybe they were involved then.   Since the DeCavalcante family is still being talked about in recent media as part of the American Mafia it implies their activities continue or have been ongoing. The answer should be True because the context states they are active and part of the Mafia. </think> True,True,True,1,1.0,66.48286580000422,0.02271558922900412,0.006669764715377971,0.01811400000588037,4.4723944410280734e-06,1.3131870952277035e-06

The context says that the program was created by Sarah Lambert and first broadcast in 2014. It mentions that it's based on real-life forced adoption in Australia. Then there are details about renewals for seasons up to four.   So the key part here is ""based on the real life forced adoption..."" That directly states the premise of the show. The other info about creation and broadcast dates supports this but doesn't contradict it. Forced adoption is a real issue in Australia so even if I wasn't familiar with the show's details the context explicitly links its basis to real events.

38,"<think> Okay let me try to figure this out based on the context provided. The question is asking whether alligators drown their prey and eat it later.  First I'll read through the given context carefully. It says that alligators' main prey are smaller animals they can kill with a single bite. Then it mentions they might kill larger prey by grabbing it and dragging them into water to drown. So there's definitely an action where they drag the prey underwater to suffocate them.  Next after drowning the prey do they eat it later? The context also talks about how alligators handle food that can't be eaten in one bite. They allow it to rot or use a death roll method by spinning wildly until chunks are torn off. But does this mean they wait and eat the already drowned prey later?  Wait maybe I'm mixing things up here. When they drown larger prey do they immediately eat it once it's dead? Or is there another step where they let it rot before eating? The context says that for food too big to bite in one go they use the death roll by spinning until chunks are separated. But if they drag a large animal into water to drown does that mean they're using the same method as handling other prey?  Hmm maybe not. Dragging into water is just to kill it quickly. Once the prey is dead and submerged do alligators then eat it on the spot? Or do they leave it there until later? The context doesn't explicitly say they wait to eat after drowning. It mentions that for large prey killed by drowning they might use the death roll if necessary but maybe they start eating immediately once it's dead.  But let me check again. The question is whether alligators drown their prey and then eat it later. So two parts: 1) Drown larger prey to kill them. 2) Eat that prey after it's been drowned (i.e. later).  From the context yes they do drag large prey into water to drown them. But does ""later"" imply waiting some time? The part about consuming food too big for one bite is by letting it rot or using death roll. So maybe when they use the death roll on a live animal but if they've already drowned the prey then perhaps they eat it immediately once it's dead.  Wait no. If they drag a large animal into water to drown them (kill them) then after that do they wait for it to rot before eating? Or do they start consuming it right away? The context doesn't mention waiting; instead the death roll is used on prey that can't be eaten in one bite but hasn't necessarily been killed yet. Maybe when a large animal is grabbed and dragged into water if it's still alive they use the death roll to tear off chunks. But once it's dead (drowned) do they eat it immediately or later?  I think the answer here depends on whether ""later"" refers to after drowning but before eating. The context says that alligators may kill larger prey by dragging into water to drown them. Then for food too big they either let it rot or use death roll. So perhaps when a large animal is drowned they don't necessarily wait; maybe they start the process of tearing it apart immediately with the death roll.  But the question specifically asks if they ""drown their prey and eat it later."" The context doesn't explicitly state that after drowning they leave it to rot before eating. It says alligators may kill larger prey by drowning them but then how do they consume? If the prey is too big for one bite they use methods like death roll or letting it rot.  Wait maybe ""later"" refers to when they can't immediately eat a large animal because of its size. So if they drown a large animal first (killing it) and then later come back to tear it apart with the death roll? But does the context support that?  Actually upon closer reading: The alligator kills larger prey by drowning them in water. Then for food too big to bite at once they either let it rot or use death roll. So if a large animal is killed by drowning (so now it's dead) then maybe they proceed with the death roll immediately after bringing it into water? Or do they wait until it's dead and then eat it in parts?  Wait no. The context says that alligators may kill larger prey by grabbing and dragging into water to drown them. Then separately for food too big (which might be alive or already killed?) they use the death roll method. So perhaps when a large animal is grabbed and dragged into water if it's still struggling they use the death roll to tear off chunks while it's submerged. But once it's dead from drowning maybe they just start eating it immediately.  Alternatively maybe ""later"" refers to cases where they can't bite in one go even after killing (if the prey is too big). So perhaps they drag a large animal into water to drown it first then wait for it to be easier to tear apart later. But does the context mention waiting?  Hmm let me parse this again. The question is: do alligators drown their prey and eat it later?   From the context: - They kill larger prey by drowning (dragging into water). - Then they consume food that can't be eaten in one bite either by letting it rot or using death roll.  So if a large animal is killed by drowning does ""later"" mean after letting it rot? Or do they immediately start eating via death roll?  Wait the context says: ""They may kill larger prey by grabbing it and dragging it into the water to drown."" Then for food too big (presumably including already dead or drowned animals?) they use methods like allowing it to rot or death roll. But does that mean after drowning a large animal they then let it rot before eating? Or do they immediately start tearing it apart with the death roll?  I think I might be overcomplicating this. The question is whether alligators both drown their prey and eat it later (after drowning). So two steps: 1) Drown by dragging into water. 2) Eat after that.  The context states that they do kill larger prey by drowning them but does not explicitly say they wait to eat until later. However the part about consuming food too big for one bite is done either by letting it rot or using death roll. So if a large animal was killed by drowning (so now dead) then perhaps they proceed with eating via death roll immediately after bringing it into water? Or do they leave it and come back?  Wait no. The context says that alligators may kill larger prey by dragging into water to drown them. Then for food too big to bite in one go they use the death roll or let it rot. So maybe when a large animal is killed by drowning (so now dead) then if it's still too big they might use the death roll immediately after killing? Or do they wait until it's easier?  Alternatively perhaps ""later"" refers to cases where they can't bite in one go even after the prey is dead. So maybe they drag a large animal into water (killing it) then later tear it apart with the death roll because it's too big at that point.  But does the context specify waiting? It says alligators may kill larger prey by drowning and for food too big they use methods like letting it rot or death roll. So if a large animal is killed by drowning (so now dead) then perhaps ""later"" means after killing them but before eating which would be part of the consumption process.  Wait maybe I'm confusing myself here. Let me break down:  1. Alligators kill larger prey by drowning: drag into water and hold until they drown. 2. Then for food that can't be eaten in one bite (even if it's a dead animal?) they either let it rot or use death roll to tear off chunks.  So the process is: - Drown large prey (kill them). - Then consume by either letting it rot or using death roll on the already killed animal.   But does ""later"" imply waiting for it to be easier? Or do they immediately start eating via death roll after drowning?  The question says: ""do alligators drown their prey and eat it later."" So both actions must occur in sequence with the eating happening after the drowning.  From the context: - They kill larger prey by drowning (dragging into water). - Then for food too big to bite at once they use methods like death roll or letting it rot.   So if a large animal is killed by drowning then ""later"" would be when they start eating it via those methods. But does the context say that after drowning they wait until later to eat? Or do they immediately proceed with the death roll?  Wait no. The question combines two things: 1) Drowning as a method of killing and 2) Eating the prey later (after drowning).   The answer should be True if both actions are part of their hunting strategy. From the context: - Yes they drown larger prey to kill them. - Then for food too big they either let it rot or use death roll. So after killing via drowning they might still need to tear off chunks later (using death roll) because even though it's dead maybe it's too large to consume entirely at once.  But does ""later"" mean immediately after drowning? Or could there be a time gap?  The context doesn't specify waiting for the prey to rot. It says alligators may kill larger prey by dragging into water to drown them. Then they handle food that can't be eaten in one bite (which might include already killed prey) by letting it rot or using death roll.  So if an animal is too big even after being killed by drowning then the alligator would use the death roll method immediately after killing? Or do they wait until it's easier?  Wait perhaps ""later"" refers to cases where they can't bite in one go because of size. So maybe they drag a large animal into water (drowning them) but if it's still too big for a single bite even then they use the death roll immediately after bringing it down? Or do they wait until it's dead and easier?  Alternatively perhaps ""later"" means after letting it rot. But does the context say that alligators let prey rot before eating? It says they may allow food to be eaten later by letting it rot OR by using death roll.  So maybe for some large prey they drown them first (kill) then wait until it's easier to eat via death roll because it might have started decomposing. But the context doesn't explicitly state that they let it rot after drowning; instead the two methods are alternatives for consuming food too big at any time.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating again. The question is: do alligators drown their prey and eat it later?   From the context: - Yes they use drowning to kill larger animals. - Then they consume such large animals by either letting them rot or using death roll (which implies tearing into pieces). So after killing via drowning if the animal is still too big for one bite they proceed with the death roll immediately. But does ""later"" mean waiting some time? Or just after the initial kill?  The context doesn't specify a delay between drowning and eating; it says that's how they kill larger prey (drag into water to drown). Then separately if food can't be eaten in one bite they use methods like death roll or letting it rot.   So perhaps ""later"" refers to the time after killing but before consuming via those methods. But does the context say they wait? It doesn't mention waiting; instead the death roll is a method used on prey that's too big for one bite.  Wait maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think differently. The question asks if alligators both drown their prey and eat it later (after drowning).   From the context: - They do kill larger prey by drowning. - Then they consume food that can't be eaten in one bite either by letting it rot or using death roll.  So after drowning a large animal does ""later"" mean when they start eating? Or is there an implication of waiting?  Actually no. The context doesn't say they wait to eat; instead the methods for consumption are listed as alternatives (rotting vs. death roll). So if they use the death roll method on a prey that was just killed by drowning then ""later"" might not apply because it's immediate.  But perhaps in some cases after killing via drowning they let the body rot before eating? The context says alligators may allow food to be eaten later by letting it rot. So maybe for large prey they drown them first (killing) and then wait until it rots more or becomes easier to tear apart.  Wait but does that mean ""later"" after drowning? Yes because the rotting process takes time. So if an alligator drags a large animal into water to drown it then leaves it there for it to start decomposing (rot) and later comes back to eat it in pieces via death roll or just bite off parts.  But does the context explicitly say that? It says they may kill larger prey by drowning them. Then for food too big to bite at once they either let it rot OR use death roll. So if a large animal is killed by drowning (so now dead) then ""later"" would be when they start consuming it via those methods.  But the question combines both actions: drowning and eating later. The context states that alligators do drown larger prey as part of killing them but does not explicitly say they wait to eat until after it rots or is easier. However since one method for consumption is letting it rot (which implies waiting) then yes in some cases they might let the prey rot and then eat it later.  Wait no. The context says: ""Alligators consume food that cannot be eaten in one bite by allowing it to rot or by biting and then spinning or convulsing wildly until bite-sized chunks are torn off."" So for any food too big (whether alive or dead?) they use these methods. But the question is about whether they both drown their prey AND eat it later.  So if an alligator drowns a large animal first that's killing via drowning. Then to consume it they either let it rot OR use death roll. So ""later"" could be part of the consumption process after the initial kill. But does ""later"" necessarily mean waiting for decomposition? Or just after the kill?  Wait perhaps I'm still overcomplicating. The question is asking if alligators both drown their prey and eat it later (after drowning).   From the context: - Yes they do drown larger prey to kill them. - Then they consume such food by either letting it rot OR using death roll.  So after drowning a large animal they proceed with consuming it via those methods. But does ""later"" imply waiting? The answer is that alligators may use both methods depending on the situation. So if they let it rot then yes they eat it later (after decomposition). If they use death roll immediately maybe not.  But since the question doesn't specify which method of consumption and one option includes letting it rot (which takes time) then in some cases alligators do drown their prey and then eat it after it has rotted. Therefore the answer is True. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,89.79241980001098,0.030682032247169123,0.009008876415891655,0.048232900007860735,1.2665828888808997e-05,3.7189481532677308e-06

I need to check if that applies here.  First the context mentions Independence Day is a day when off-premises liquor sales are banned. Since the 4th of July is Independence Day in the US and Oklahoma follows this rule according to the given info then yes liquor stores can't sell alcohol on that day.   The user might be planning an event or trip around the Fourth and wants to know if they can buy drinks locally. They probably need a quick confirmation without extra details.

40,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether thread seal tape is the same as Teflon tape. From the context provided I remember that they mentioned both terms are used interchangeably but there's a nuance here.  The context says that thread seal tape is made of PTFE and is commonly known as plumber's tape or sometimes called Teflon tape. However it also states that Chemours (the owners of the Teflon trademark) consider using ""Teflon tape"" incorrect because they no longer manufacture Teflon in tape form. So technically since Teflon is a brand name for PTFE and the generic term would be PTFE or Teflon itself but here the context clarifies that Chemours doesn't produce Teflon tape anymore.  But wait even though they don't manufacture it under their own brand as tape other companies might still use ""Teflon tape"" generically. The key point is whether they are chemically the same. Since both refer to PTFE film tape which has the properties mentioned like sealing and lubrication maybe in practice they're considered the same.  However the context explicitly says that Chemours considers the usage incorrect because Teflon was their brand name for PTFE but now they don't make it as tape. So even though the material is identical (PTFE) the term ""Teflon tape"" might be a genericized trademark. But in common parlance people often use both terms interchangeably.  The question is whether they are the same product. The answer would depend on if we're talking about the substance or the brand name. Since PTFE is the material and Teflon was the original brand but now other brands sell it as such maybe yes. But Chemours might argue against using ""Teflon tape"" because they don't produce it anymore.  Hmm so in terms of chemical composition both are made from PTFE. The context says thread seal tape is a PTFE film tape and also known as Teflon tape. Even though the trademark holders say that term is incorrect for their product now since they stopped making Teflon tape other manufacturers might still use it generically.  But wait the question is about whether they are the same. The context says thread seal tape is PTFE and also known as Teflon tape. So even though Chemours doesn't produce under that name anymore the material is identical. Therefore in practical terms yes but legally maybe not. However since the answer needs to be True or False based on the provided context which states they are the same product (even if trademarked differently) then the answer would be True.  But let me check again. The context says ""Thread seal tape (also known as PTFE tape or plumber's tape)"" and mentions that it is also called Teflon tape. So regardless of whether Chemours produces it they are considered the same product in common usage. Therefore even though there might be a trademark issue for the purpose of this question thread seal tape is indeed the same as Teflon tape because both refer to PTFE film tape used for sealing threads.  So the answer should be True. </think> True",True,False,0,0.0,73.37843849998899,0.02513358504960308,0.007379738075240025,0.022744399990187958,5.72823277907446e-06,1.6819270891973833e-06

But does that mean all students must be Mormons? Not necessarily. It just means that the majority is. The rest would be about 2% which includes ethnic minorities like Asians Pacific Islanders and Hispanics as well as foreign students from various countries.  The context mentions that students from every state in the U.S. and many foreign countries attend BYU. So there are international students too. But it doesn't say they're all LDS members. It just says a significant percentage (8%) of them are active Mormons. The rest could be non-Mormons right? Also among the student body 12.6% are ethnic minorities who might not necessarily identify as Mormons either.  So even though most students are Mormons there's still a small percentage that aren't. Therefore you don't have to be a Mormon to attend BYU because it's not exclusive; others can also enroll. </think> False,False,False,1,1.0,58.64304870000342,0.020097264381555038,0.005900970628424897,0.009103599993977696,2.0597916654272315e-06,6.047972444207859e-07
42,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if Dr. Burke comes back after Season 3. I remember that in Grey's Anatomy Dr. Meredith Grey's ex-boyfriend who was a surgeon named Derek but wait—Dr. Burke? That might be a mix-up because the main character leaving around then was Cristina Yang.  The context provided says he officially returns in the tenth season to conclude Cristina Yang's departure. So that's Season 10. The question is about after Season 3. Since the return mentioned here is specifically for Season 10 which is much later than Season 3 I need to check if there was any mention or appearance of Burke before then.  Wait in earlier seasons especially around Season 3 when Cristina leaves did Burke come back? The context says he's ""mentioned in passing throughout later seasons"" but not until the tenth season does he officially return. So between Seasons 1-9 except for maybe brief mentions he didn't appear again after his initial introduction.  Cristina left during Season 4 or something like that. But the key point is that the official return was in Season 10 to wrap up her story. The question is whether Burke came back after Season 3. Since the context doesn't mention any return before Season 10 and he's not part of the main cast anymore by then probably the answer is no.  But wait maybe there were other instances where he returned earlier? Let me think... No I don't recall him coming back until Season 10. The context says ""officially returns in the tenth season "" so that implies his return was confirmed and part of the main storyline at that time. Therefore after Season 3 which is much earlier he didn't come back unless there's another mention elsewhere.  The question specifically asks about after Season 3 but the provided context only talks about his return in Season 10. Since no other information is given here I should stick to what's stated. So if the official return was in Season 10 and he wasn't mentioned as returning before that then the answer would be False. </think> False",False,True,0,0.0,59.92982910000137,0.02052822143809386,0.006027508493701827,0.05586500000208616,1.4684030003425302e-05,4.311533555614103e-06
43,"<think> First the question is: ""can a dog be mixed with 3 breeds?""  I need to answer ONLY with 'True' or 'False' based on the provided context. The instruction says to be thorough in my analysis but keep the answer simple.  Now looking at the context:  - It talks about crossbred ""designer dogs"" where puppies are named by portmanteaus from two purebred parents like Schnoodle (Schnauzer and Poodle).  - Then it mentions other crosses with multiple breeds: for example German Chusky involves three breeds – German Shepherd Dog Husky and Chow Chow.  The context explicitly states that there are complex crosses with multiple breeds in recent ancestry being labeled this way. Specifically it gives an example of a dog from at least three breeds: German Chusky (German Shepherd Dog Husky Chow Chow).  So the question is about whether a dog can be mixed with 3 breeds. In other words can there be dogs that are crosses between more than two purebred breeds?  From the context:  - Designer dogs often involve two breeds.  - But it also says ""even complex crosses (with multiple breeds in recent ancestry) being labeled in this manner.""  - And provides an example: German Chusky with three breeds.  Therefore based on this yes a dog can be mixed with 3 or more breeds. The context confirms that such things exist and are common for designer dogs.  The question says ""mixed with 3 breeds "" which might imply exactly three but the context doesn't specify it has to be exactly two; it allows for multiple. So even if not exactly three it can have three in its mix.  Also the answer should be based solely on the context provided. I don't need external knowledge.  Analysis:  - The context defines a ""designer dog"" primarily as a cross between two breeds with portmanteau names.  - But then it says: ""There are even complex crosses (with multiple breeds in recent ancestry) being labeled in this manner.""  - This directly indicates that dogs can be mixed from more than two breeds including three or more.  Therefore the answer should be 'True'.  The instruction is to not overcomplicate thinking and just use one word. So I need to output only 'True' or 'False'.  Final decision: Based on context it's true that a dog can be mixed with 3 breeds. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,58.60044900001958,0.020073255729174785,0.005893921193743929,0.038039700011722744,9.86830111230827e-06,2.8975363965271214e-06
44,<think> Okay let's figure this out. The question is asking whether the right atrium receives blood from the lungs. I need to check the context provided.  The context says humans have a four-chambered heart with parts like atria and ventricles. It explains that the right atrium gets deoxygenated blood from veins such as the superior vena cava inferior vena cava cardiac veins and coronary sinus. Then it sends this blood to the right ventricle via the tricusicle valve which goes to the pulmonary artery for oxygenation in the lungs.  So the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from systemic circulation through those veins. The left atrium gets oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins after returning from the lungs. Therefore the right atrium doesn't receive blood directly from the lungs; instead it sends blood there for processing. Answer should be False. </think> False,False,True,0,0.0,56.106168600003,0.0192317850683568,0.005646848081707573,0.024192399985622615,6.130799440789915e-06,1.800128949991243e-06
45,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether a certification of birth is the same as a birth certificate. I need to check the provided context for any clues.  The context says that the actual record of birth is stored with a government agency. They issue certified copies or representations of this original record upon request. These certifications can be used for things like passports and are signed/sealed by an authorized person.   Now ""certification"" here refers to the official document provided by the government as a copy or representation of the original birth record. The term ""birth certificate"" is commonly understood to be that exact document. So in this case the certification they mention would likely be what people call a birth certificate. Therefore yes they are the same thing. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,56.49721729999874,0.019362972507764357,0.005685367415088725,0.017993599991314113,4.434943887139929e-06,1.3021908414930406e-06
46,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether there really exists something called ""dry water."" I remember from the context provided that it was described as an unusual form of ""powdered liquid "" specifically a water-air emulsion where tiny water droplets are coated with silica. So even though it looks like salt (which is solid) it's mostly water—95% liquid to be precise.  The key points here are the composition and structure. The silica coating prevents the droplets from merging back into regular liquid form. That makes sense because without that barrier the water would just flow together. So even though it appears dry or powdery each particle is still a tiny droplet of water protected by silica.  Also the context mentions that among researchers it's known as ""empty water."" This term emphasizes that while it looks like a solid powder its content is liquid water inside those coated droplets. So there's definitely a substance here that behaves differently from typical dry powders because each particle contains liquid but stays stable due to the silica shell.  I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. The question isn't asking about its common use or how it's made just whether such a thing exists. Since the context clearly states what ""dry water"" is and describes it as existing (a white powder that looks like salt but consists of 95% liquid water) then yes it does exist. Even though it might sound contradictory because it's essentially liquid in a solid-like form the explanation provided confirms its existence.  So my answer should be True based on this information. </think> True",True,False,0,0.0,58.605391800025245,0.02007876725652633,0.005895539491657602,0.033285200013779104,8.555628331345765e-06,2.5121086398866814e-06
47,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether all states enforce a minimum drinking age of 21. I need to check the context provided.  The context says that the act didn't outlaw consumption for those under 21 but just the purchase. Then it mentions several states like Alabama Indiana etc. extended the law to an outright ban. So in these states there's a ban on underage drinking as well as purchasing. But wait the key part is about state laws and the minimum age.  Further down it says that most states still permit underage consumption of alcohol under certain circumstances. That means even though some have stricter laws (like banning all private consumption) many allow drinking by minors in specific situations. For example Colorado allows supervised family members to consume with consent. So not every state enforces a strict 21 for both buying and consuming.  Also the act doesn't criminalize religious occasions where alcohol is consumed. But that's more about exceptions rather than enforcing 21 everywhere. The main point is that while some states have a ban on underage drinking (like those mentioned) others allow it under certain conditions. Therefore not all states enforce a minimum drinking age of 21 strictly for both purchase and consumption. </think> False,False,True,0,0.0,56.509352499997476,0.01936683283221864,0.005686500885833222,0.02254430000903085,5.6828689306258125e-06,1.6686073292437117e-06
48,"<think> First the question is: ""does every country have their own sign language?""  The context provided says: ""There are perhaps three hundred sign languages in use around the world today. The number is not known with any confidence; new sign languages emerge frequently through creolization and de novo (and occasionally through language planning). In some countries such as Sri Lanka and Tanzania each school for the deaf may have a separate language known only to its students and sometimes denied by the school; on the other hand countries may share sign languages though sometimes under different names (Croatian and Serbian Indian and Pakistani). Deaf sign languages also arise outside educational institutions especially in village communities with high levels of congenital deafness but there are significant sign languages developed for the hearing as well such as the speech-taboo languages used in aboriginal Australia. Scholars are doing field surveys to identify the world's sign languages.""  I need to answer ONLY with 'True' or 'False'. No other words or explanations.  The context mentions that not every country has its own unique sign language because countries can share them. For example it says ""Croatian and Serbian"" might be referring to a shared sign language between those two countries even though they are different nations. Also in Sri Lanka and Tanzania each school for the deaf may have a separate language but this is within countries not necessarily that every country has one.  The context states: ""In some countries... each school for the deaf may have a separate language"" – this implies variation within countries but it doesn't say that all countries have their own sign language. In fact it contrasts with other parts where countries share sign languages.  Moreover there are cases like aboriginal Australia where sign languages are developed for the hearing which might not be considered ""their own"" in the same way as national Deaf sign languages.  The key point is that countries may share sign languages and not all places have distinct ones. For instance Croatian and Serbian are mentioned together suggesting they can use the same sign language despite being separate countries.  Also Sri Lanka and Tanzania examples show that within a country there might be multiple or shared systems but it doesn't imply every country has one exclusively.  The question is about whether every country has their own sign language. From the context we know there are approximately 300 sign languages globally not necessarily one per country. Countries can share them as in the case of Croatian and Serbian being listed together for a shared language.  Therefore it's not true that every country has its own unique sign language because some countries might use sign languages from neighboring regions or even share with other countries.  The context doesn't explicitly say that there is only one per country; it says ""perhaps three hundred"" which suggests diversity and possibly multiple in some areas. But the question is specifically about each country having their own meaning a distinct national sign language for deaf communities.  In many cases sign languages are tied to specific countries or regions but not universally so. For example American Sign Language (ASL) is primarily used in the US and Canada while British Sign Language (BSL) is in the UK etc. But the context doesn't confirm that all 195+ countries have one.  It says: ""countries may share sign languages"" – this directly contradicts the idea that every country has its own unique one.  Also it mentions that new ones emerge frequently so even if some do not necessarily all.  So based on this I think the answer should be False because there are examples of shared sign languages and no indication that each country must have a distinct one.  But let's make sure: is there any part that suggests every country has one? The context says ""there are perhaps three hundred "" which might imply fewer than 195 countries but actually the number of sign languages isn't directly tied to the number of countries. Some small communities or regions might not have a formalized sign language.  The question is phrased as ""does every country have their own sign language?"" and from the context we can infer that it's not necessarily true because sharing occurs.  Answer should be just 'True' or 'False'. </think> False",False,False,1,1.0,65.37592930000392,0.022384549291135036,0.00657256457345249,0.03171700000530109,8.214789440777773e-06,2.412031323686743e-06
49,<think> Okay let's figure out if there are tolls on I-70 in Kansas. The context says that I-70 intersects a child route called I-470 twice. At the second intersection which is where the Kansas Turnpike merges I-70 becomes a toll road. This section from Topeka to Bonner Springs is tolled and costs up to $17.50 as of 2016. The rest of the highway beyond that point including from 18th Street onwards towards the eastern border is free.  So in Kansas specifically on I-70 after merging with the turnpike until Bonner Springs there are tolls. But what about other parts? The context mentions another tolled section along the Pennsylvania Turnpike but that's not in Kansas. Since the question is about Kansas we can ignore the PA part. Therefore yes there are tolls on I-70 in Kansas for a specific segment. </think> True,True,True,1,1.0,56.93588610002189,0.019509956261706804,0.0057285248716660514,0.009381999989273027,2.0520833325766337e-06,6.02533919180001e-07
50,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether ""The Mountain Between Us"" is a true story. I need to check the context provided.  Looking at the context it says the film is based on a 2011 novel by Charles Martin. So unless the movie itself was adapted from real events without mentioning the source material which isn't indicated here then it's not a true story. The context doesn't mention any real incidents or documentaries; it just credits the novel as the basis. Movies based on novels are fictional unless specified otherwise.

51,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Trinity Forest Golf Club is a public course. The context provided says it's an 18-hole private golf club in Dallas Texas.  Hmm so the key here is that the context explicitly states it's a private golf club. Public courses are usually accessible to anyone for a fee or free but private ones require membership and might have restricted access. Since the context mentions ""private "" I don't think there's any ambiguity about its status as a public course.  Wait maybe someone could argue that even if it's listed as private some non-members might play sometimes? But no unless specified otherwise the default classification based on the information given is that it's private. The question doesn't mention exceptions or special cases so sticking to the direct statement from the context should be correct.  Yeah definitely not a public course then.

52,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the away goal counts in the playoffs based on the provided context.  First I need to understand what the context says. It mentions that before the 1999-2000 season away goals were used as a tie-breaker after extra time. But then there was an initiative by David Sheepshanks from Ipswich Town because his club lost twice on away goals in 1997 and 1999. After that the use of away goals was abolished.  So before 1999-2000 yes away goals were used. But after those two instances (1997 and 1999) they stopped using it. The context says ""since then"" meaning from 1999 onwards away goals have no part in the play-off system.  The question is about whether the away goal count still applies today. Since the rule was abolished after 1999-2000 and the context states that since then it hasn't been used the answer should be false. </think> False",False,False,1,1.0,50.49796419998165,0.017298518716983343,0.005079201274670135,0.02133529999991879,5.248573332533447e-06,1.541089199425539e-06
53,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" is an autobiography. I remember that Maya Angelou wrote several books and this one is supposed to be her story.  The context provided says it's a 1969 autobiography describing her early years. It mentions being the first in a seven-volume series and how she transforms from having an inferiority complex to becoming self-possessed.

54,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is whether money from Guernsey is legal tender in the UK. The context says that the pound is the currency of Guernsey but since 1921 they've been in a currency union with the UK. That means their banknotes and coins are denominated in pound sterling similar to Scotland England and Northern Ireland.  The key point here is ""local issue"" of banknotes and coins. The context also mentions that these can be exchanged at par with other sterling coinage and notes. So even though Guernsey issues its own pounds they're part of the same currency system as the rest of the UK.   Legal tender refers to money that must be accepted if offered for payment. In the UK pound sterling is legal tender. The context says the Guernsey pound can be exchanged at par with other sterling notes. That implies it's recognized as equivalent to UK currency but not necessarily considered legal tender there.  Since they're part of a currency union and their notes are denominated in pounds sterling same as the UK maybe they are accepted? But wait the term ""local issue"" might mean that while they look like UK money they aren't exactly the same. The Banknotes of the pound sterling section probably explains that other countries' issues (like Guernsey's) can be used but not legally required to accept them.  So even though you can exchange Guernsey pounds at par with UK ones in terms of legal tender only the UK-issued notes are recognized as such. Therefore money from Guernsey isn't legal tender in the UK. </think> False",False,True,0,0.0,46.91235300002154,0.01606953520609274,0.004718346410898729,0.016204799991101027,3.970088332264115e-06,1.1656996791286786e-06
55,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the transmission and engine are the same thing based on the provided context.  First I'll read through the context carefully. It says that transmissions are used in motor vehicles to adapt the output of the internal combustion engine to the drive wheels. So here the transmission is connected to the engine but not part of it. The engine operates at high speeds which isn't suitable for all driving conditions like starting or slow travel. The transmission's job is to reduce that speed and increase torque.  Also transmissions are mentioned in other contexts like bicycles and fixed machines where they adapt different rotational speeds. So regardless of whether it's a vehicle or something else the transmission is an accessory component attached to the engine. It doesn't generate power itself; it modifies what the engine produces.  The key points are that the engine provides the mechanical energy (power) while the transmission takes that and adjusts it for the wheels. They serve different functions in the system. Therefore they're not the same thing. </think> False,False,False,1,1.0,39.81141349999234,0.013600273322038427,0.003993320279229451,0.01896569997188635,4.706765552044898e-06,1.3820032791622146e-06

I remember that in the context provided it says ""It is the second installment in the Indiana Jones franchise and a prequel to the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark."" So since it mentions being a prequel to Raiders which came out before this movie (1984 vs. 1981) that means Temple of Doom takes place before Raiders. Therefore yes it is a prequel because it sets up events and characters from earlier in the timeline than what's shown in Raiders.  Wait but sometimes franchises have movies set after others even if they're sequels. The context specifically states it's a prequel to Raiders so that should be clear. No other conflicting info here.

57,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the Canadian dollar (CAD) is worth more than the USD. The context says that since the late 2000s the CAD has been valued at levels comparable to before its swift rise in 2007. Then it mentions that a dollar in the mid-70 cent US range was usual for much of the 2010s.  First I need to understand what ""worth more"" means here. It probably refers to the exchange rate where CAD is stronger than USD. So if CAD/USD is above 1 then CAD is worth more. But in the context given they're talking about the value of CAD relative to USD at different times.  The key part is that after 2007's rise the CAD has been valued comparably since the late 2000s. The example from the mid-70s cents range (so around 0.75) suggests that during the 2010s it was roughly at that level. Since then if there's no mention of a change in value above USD parity maybe CAD hasn't been worth more than USD for long.  Wait but ""worth more"" could be ambiguous. If someone says CAD is worth more than USD they might mean 1 CAD = X USD where X > 1. However the context states that the CAD was around mid-70 cents in US dollars during the 2010s. So if one CAD equals about 0.75 USD then CAD isn't stronger; it's weaker because you need more than one CAD to get a full USD.  The question is whether CAD is worth more than USD. In terms of exchange rate that would mean CAD/USD > 1. But the context says in the mid-70s cents range (so less than 1). Therefore during those years CAD was actually weaker against USD. So unless there's a period where CAD exceeded 1.00 against USD which isn't mentioned here the answer would be false.  The user wants just 'True' or 'False'. The context doesn't indicate that CAD has been worth more than USD for an extended period post-2007; it says comparable levels to before its rise in 2007. Since the peak was around then and after that the rate settled into a lower range (mid-70s cents) so CAD hasn't been above parity. Therefore the answer is False. </think> False",False,True,0,0.0,41.44337710001855,0.014140192017686473,0.004151851525287034,0.01854069999535568,4.655030604769983e-06,1.3668128334111717e-06
58,"<think> Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is asking if Mickey and Minnie's House is still in the Magic Kingdom. From the context provided it says that ""Mickey's House and Meet Mickey"" was a walk-through attraction at Mickey's Toontown in Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland. It also mentions that similar attractions used to exist in Magic Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland.  So the key points here are: 1. The original attraction is called ""Mickey's House and Meet Mickey"". 2. This specific one is located in Mickey's Toontown at Disneyland (which I assume refers to the US version) and Tokyo Disneyland. 3. It says that similar attractions were in Magic Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland but those are former locations.  Wait so the context doesn't say that ""Mickey's House"" exists now in Magic Kingdom; it just mentions that there used to be a similar attraction there. The question is about whether Mickey and Minnie's House (which might be a different name) is still there. But the original context refers to ""Mickey's House"" not including Minnie so maybe the question is mixing things up.  Also I know from general Disney knowledge that Magic Kingdom has had changes over time. The classic Mickey Saves the Day attraction was replaced by something else in the late 90s or early 2000s. But the context doesn't mention any current presence of ""Mickey's House"" there; it just says similar attractions existed before.  So putting this together: The context states that a specific ""Mickey's House and Meet Mickey"" is not in Magic Kingdom now because those were former attractions.

The context says that MLB has taken actions to lower tobacco usage among players. It mentions a complete ban on tobacco with fines for those caught. There's also a part about the new Collective Bargaining Agreement effective December 5 2016 which prohibits players entering MLB for the first time from using tobacco. Existing players before that date are grandfathered in.  So the key points here are: - A complete ban on tobacco is enforced now. - Players and managers can be fined if caught using it. - New players (since Dec 5 2016) aren't allowed to use tobacco but those who were already there before that date might still do it.  The question specifically asks about chewing tobacco. The context refers to ""tobacco"" in general and mentions dipping as a form of tobacco use. Since the ban is on tobacco products including chewing tobacco this should apply. Even though some players are grandfathered the current policy prohibits new usage entirely. So yes chewing tobacco is banned under these rules. </think> True",True,False,0,0.0,36.41400769999018,0.012395948618951698,0.0036397057491581973,0.035918000008678064,7.68087333466004e-06,2.255262561509572e-06
60,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if there's still a water crisis in Cape Town based on the provided context.  First I need to understand what constitutes a ""water crisis"" here. From the context the main event was the predicted ""Day Zero "" which would have shut off the municipal water supply when certain storage levels were reached. The city implemented measures and by June 2018 dam levels increased to 43% leading them to say Day Zero wasn't expected for 2019. However they still had water restrictions in place until the dams reach 85%.  Now as of July 16 2018 the storage level was at 55.1%. Since the restrictions are lifted only when it reaches 85% and currently it's 55.1% which is below that threshold then yes water restrictions are still in place. The context mentions that these restrictions remain until dam levels reach 85% so even though they said Day Zero wasn't coming for 2019 the crisis isn't fully over because restrictions are ongoing. Therefore there's still a water crisis. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,38.92170679999981,0.013250200274517992,0.0038905316244154547,0.03188299998873845,8.198582779732531e-06,2.4072727143060264e-06
61,"<think> Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is asking if Guitar Center and Musicians Friend are the same company. I need to answer with just 'True' or 'False' nothing else.  Looking at the context provided: In 2000 Guitar Center bought Musician's Friend for $50 million. It says that after the purchase Musician's Friend became a wholly owned subsidiary of Guitar Center. The headquarters were in Medford Oregon until 2011 when they moved to Westlake Village California into Guitar Center's facilities. So since one company owns another and integrates its operations they must be part of the same corporate structure now.  Wait but does owning a subsidiary mean they are the same company? No legally speaking a subsidiary is a separate entity owned by the parent company. But in terms of business operations they might function as part of the same organization. The question here is whether they're the same company or just under one's umbrella.  The context says Musician's Friend became a wholly-owned subsidiary until 2011 when its headquarters were consolidated into Guitar Center's facilities. So after 2011 are they still separate? Or did that consolidation mean they merged?  Hmm consolidating operations doesn't necessarily mean merging the companies entirely. The ownership structure remains with Guitar Center holding Musician's Friend as a subsidiary. Even if their offices are in the same place legally and structurally they're different entities unless explicitly merged.  But maybe the question is about whether they operate under the same brand or management now. Since the headquarters moved into Guitar Center's facilities perhaps there's no distinction anymore. However the context doesn't mention a merger; it just says consolidation of operations. So unless specified otherwise they remain separate companies even after the move.  Wait but in 2011 when consolidating Musician's Friend became part of Guitar Center's facilities. Does that mean they are now one company? Or is it still a subsidiary operating under its own name?  The context doesn't say they merged; just that operations were consolidated into Guitar Center's facilities. So the legal ownership might still be separate but operationally they're combined. The question is whether they are the same company. If by ""same company"" they mean part of the same corporate structure or brand then maybe True. But if it means legally identical entities then False.  But in business terms a subsidiary isn't considered the same company as its parent unless merged. So even though their headquarters moved into Guitar Center's offices Musician's Friend remains a separate entity owned by Guitar Center. Therefore they are not the same company but part of the same larger corporation. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,41.64069999998901,0.014197314520986553,0.004168623868417737,0.03624629997648299,9.405513909492077e-06,2.761652544915175e-06

From the context provided there's a mention of Bracken realizing that Beckett was bluffing and trying to frame her for the murder of his associate Vulcan Simmons. Wait but actually in the episode ""Veritas "" Bracken captures Beckett because he thinks she ordered her mother's death. Then he leaves her to be killed by his thugs.  But wait there's more here. Mr. Smith returns and reveals that there might be a tape recording of Bracken admitting to murder. So maybe Bracken is involved in her mom's killing? The context says Beckett remembers Captain Montgomery advising her to look for clues in her mother's appointment book and tape recordings. Then Castle helps her deduce where the tape is which turns out to be evidence against Brackon.  Bracken admits to conspiracy fraud and the murder of Beckett's mom during a live interview. So he confesses directly that he was involved in her mother's murder as part of his scheme with mobster extortion and killing FBI agents.

The context says there was little fighting in Florida mentioning only one major conflict which was the Battle of Olustee near Lake City in February 1864. So even though it's specified as a ""major"" conflict it does count as a battle. The rest talks about other activities like slave escapes and deserters but doesn't mention any other battles. Also after the war there was federal control re-established slavery abolished and the governor committing suicide.

64,<think> Okay let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether minors can receive the death penalty in the United States. I remember that there was a significant case around 2005 involving juveniles and capital punishment.  The context provided says that capital punishment for juveniles existed until March 1 2005 when the U.S. Supreme Court banned it in Roper v. Simmons. So before this date minors could be sentenced to death. After that ruling it's prohibited.   I need to make sure I understand the question correctly. The user is asking if minors can get the death penalty now or generally. Since the context mentions a specific ban by the Supreme Court in 2005 the answer should reflect current law. So after March 1 2005 it's not allowed for juveniles.  The user might be concerned about legal rights of minors or recent cases where this could apply. But according to the context the practice was banned by a landmark case. The question is straightforward: can they get it now? Since the ban happened in 2005 and the context doesn't mention any overturning the answer should be false.  Also the user wants just 'True' or 'False' so I need to stick to that without extra explanation. They probably want a quick confirmation based on the given info. </think> False,False,True,0,0.0,47.71726720003062,0.01628546853744003,0.004781748883085331,0.03241160002653487,6.7168538919455985e-06,1.972206603808711e-06
65,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) were in the World Cup in 2018. I remember that the user provided a context saying T&T didn't qualify between certain years. Specifically they mentioned not qualifying from 1966 to 2002 then again from 2010 to 2018.  So first I need to check if there's any World Cup in those periods where T&T might have qualified. The last time before 2018 was 2010 and the context says they didn't qualify after that until... wait actually the context states they failed between 1966-2002 and then again from 2010 to 2018. That means in 2018 specifically according to the context they were not qualified.  I should confirm if there's any exception or other World Cups around that time. But since the user provided a clear statement about their non-qualification periods and didn't mention any participation outside those dates I can rely on that. The 2018 World Cup was held in Russia so T&T would have needed to qualify for it. Given the context's information they were not qualified during that period.  So the answer should be False because according to the provided context T&T didn't make it to the 2018 World Cup. </think> False,False,False,1,1.0,48.20130180002889,0.016467616643827187,0.004835231317580261,0.024719500011997297,6.2154988905402e-06,1.8249984524136174e-06
66,"<think> First the question is: ""has there ever been a perfect tennis match?"" I need to answer only with 'True' or 'False' based on the provided context.  The context talks about a ""golden match "" which is defined as an opponent not losing a single point in the entire match. It says this has only been recorded three times in competitive tennis history and never in a best of 5 set match. The examples given are from 1910 by Hazel Wightman and then two more recent ones in September and October 2016.  Now what is a ""perfect tennis match""? I need to infer this from the context. A perfect match might imply that one player wins all points or something similar but it's not explicitly defined. However the golden match seems directly related because it involves no lost points by the opponent.  The question says ""perfect tennis match "" and in the context a golden match is described where an opponent doesn't lose any points. But let's read carefully: ""a golden match in which an opponent does not lose a single point."" So for there to be a perfect match it might mean that one player wins all points without losing any.  The context says this feat has been recorded three times so if a perfect match is the same as a golden match (where no points are lost) then yes it has happened.  But I should confirm what ""perfect tennis match"" means. It's not defined in the context but based on common usage or inference it probably refers to a match where one player wins every point which aligns with the golden match description.  The question is about a perfect tennis match and the context provides information about golden matches. Since a golden match involves no lost points by the opponent meaning all points are won by one side that could be considered a perfect match from the perspective of scoring.  In tennis a point is scored when the opponent fails to win it. So if an opponent does not lose any points they must have ""won"" every point or something similar? No let's parse this.  The phrase is: ""an opponent does not lose a single point."" In tennis terminology losing a point means that you were the one who failed to win it; so for example if Player A loses a point it means Player B won that point. But in the golden match context it says ""an opponent does not lose a single point "" which might be ambiguous.  Let's read the exact wording: ""a golden match in which an opponent does not lose a single point.""  This could mean two things:  1. The player who is being challenged (the one playing against) does not lose any points during the match.  2. Or it means that for every point played there was no loss by either side? But that doesn't make sense because in tennis each point has a winner or loser except deuces and advantage situations but generally points are won or lost.  In standard tennis scoring:  - A player loses a point if they fail to win it against the opponent's serve or rally.  But here ""an opponent does not lose a single point"" – I think this means that in the match one of the players (the opponent) did not lose any points. That is all points were won by them or something? No.  Let's clarify: In a golden set or similar terms it often refers to winning every game without dropping a set. But here it's ""golden match "" and specifically about losing no points.  The context says: ""an opponent does not lose a single point in an entire match."" So for example if Player A is playing against Player B and Player B (the opponent) loses no points that means all points are won by Player B or lost by Player A? No.  If the opponent does not lose any points it implies that every time there was a point to be played the opponent won it. But in tennis when you serve if you win the first return and so on but let's think carefully.  Standard interpretation: In a match where an opponent loses no points it means that one player (let's say Player X) wins all points against another player (Player Y). So for every point played Player Y fails to win it meaning Player X wins the point. But in tennis scoring points are won by either side.  Perhaps I should look at how golden matches are defined elsewhere or infer from context.  The context gives examples: Hazel Wightman had a golden match where she didn't lose any points and similarly for Tullou and de Schepper.  In fact it says: ""Hazel Wightman of the United States recorded the first competitive golden match in 1910."" And then ""Benjamin Tullou... on 3 September 2016"" and ""Joffrey de Schepper... on 15 October 2016.""  It doesn't specify who was playing against but from the description it seems that in these matches one player (the winner) did not lose any points to their opponent.  For instance when Wightman had a golden match she didn't lose any points. Similarly for Tullou and de Schepper.  But let's read: ""an opponent does not lose a single point"" – this might be poorly worded or ambiguous.  Perhaps it means that the player who is considered the opponent (in terms of being challenged) loses no points during their service game or something but I think in common parlance a golden set refers to winning all games without dropping any and similarly for match.  But here it's ""golden match "" defined as an opponent not losing a single point. Let's assume that means one player wins every point against the other.  In tennis if you win every point you would win the game easily but let's confirm with the context.  The context also mentions: ""the feat to be repeated... first by Benjamin Tullou... and then on 15 October 2016 by Joffrey de Schepper.""  And it says about Tomas Fabian that he was the opponent in both cases failing to win a single game or something? No.  ""Mr. de Schepper did allow Fabian an ``honor point'' but still credited with golden match."" But for Wightman and others it's not specified who the opponent was.  Perhaps I need to think about what constitutes a perfect match.  Maybe ""perfect tennis match"" means that one player wins all points in the entire match which is exactly what a golden match seems to be from the context.  The question says: ""has there ever been a perfect tennis match""  And based on the context it has happened three times (including Wightman's 1910).  But let's make sure about the definition. In some contexts ""perfect"" might refer to winning all games or something else but here the golden match is defined by not losing any points.  Another thing: in tennis a point can be won without it being counted if there are deuces and advantage situations but generally for simplicity we consider that every point has a winner except when it's not decided (like on serve).  But I think for this purpose the context is clear that a golden match means no lost points by one player.  Moreover the question might be using ""perfect"" in a similar way to ""golden "" meaning an undefeated performance or something.  Perhaps ""perfect tennis match"" could mean winning all games without losing any but let's see what the context says about sets.  The context mentions that it never happened in a best of 5 set match. But for points it has been recorded three times.  Now to answer the question: Has there ever been a perfect tennis match?  If ""perfect"" is synonymous with ""golden "" then yes because it was recorded three times.  But let's check if the context defines anything else.  The context says: ""A golden match... in which an opponent does not lose a single point.""  And later for de Schepper he allowed Fabian an honor point but still credited with golden match. So even though there might have been one instance where points were conceded or something it's generally considered that no points were lost by the winner.  But for Wightman and others it seems straightforward: she didn't lose any points in her matches.  Now about Tomas Fabian: he failed to win a single game in five different matches. But ""failed to win"" might mean he lost all games or something else? In tennis if you fail to win a game it means the opponent won that game.  But let's not overcomplicate; I need to stick to the context.  The key point is: has there ever been an instance where one player did not lose any points in a match?  From the context yes three times recorded.  Therefore for ""perfect tennis match "" if it means no lost points by one player then True.  But what about matches that are best of 5 sets? The context says never happened there but since the question doesn't specify set type and golden match is defined generally I think we can say yes.  The question is: ""has there ever been a perfect tennis match"" – it might be interpreted as winning all points or something similar.  Perhaps in some contexts ""perfect match"" means something else like scoring without errors or achieving maximum score with no mistakes.  But based on the provided context which defines golden match by not losing any points I should go with that definition for consistency.  Moreover the instruction is to use only 'True' or 'False' and be thorough in analysis but answer simply.  So my reasoning: The context explicitly states that a golden match (which seems equivalent to perfect match) has been recorded three times. Therefore yes there has been one.  But let's confirm if ""perfect tennis match"" is directly defined as the same thing.  The question says ""perfect tennis match "" not ""golden match."" But in the absence of other definitions I think it's safe to assume that ""perfect"" might be a synonym or similar concept here.  Perhaps there's an implication. The context talks about golden matches being rare and never in best of 5 but doesn't mention perfect matches separately.  But since the question is asking based on this context I should infer from what's given.  Another angle: In tennis you can have a match where one player wins all games without losing any which might be called a ""golden set"" or something similar. But here it's about points for golden match.  Let's read carefully: ""a golden match in which an opponent does not lose a single point""  So if the opponent loses no points that means every point was won by them? No.  If Player A is playing against Player B and Player B (the opponent) does not lose any points it could mean:  - Either Player B wins all points or  - But in tennis scoring when you serve losing a point might be defined differently. Typically ""losing a point"" means failing to win that particular point.  But let's think: In the match if an opponent does not lose any points it implies that they won every point against them? That doesn't make sense because in tennis each point is between two players.  Standard interpretation: When we say one player loses no points it means that all points were won by that player. For example Player X wins every single point played during the match.  In Wightman's case she didn't lose any points so she must have won all points against her opponents in those matches.  Similarly for Tull and de Schepper.  Therefore a perfect tennis match could be interpreted as one where no points were lost by the winner or something similar.  Moreover the context says it has been recorded three times so there is evidence of such events occurring.  Thus based on this I think the answer should be True.  But let's make sure about the honor point part. For de Schepper he allowed Fabian an honor point by deliberately hitting a ball in the last game out. But that was during his match against Fabian? No it says ""Mr. de Schepper did allow Fabian an ``honor point''"" but this is for the event where both Tullou and de Schepper played against Fabian.  Let's read: ""the unfortunate opponent to both of these men in their golden matches was a 55-year-old amateur Tomas Fabian... Mr. de Schepper did allow Fabian an ``honor point''""  So for the two French players' golden matches they were playing against Fabian and in one instance (de Schepper) he conceded an honor point but still is credited with a golden match because overall no points lost or something.  But from this it's clear that there have been matches where one player did not lose any points to their opponent during the entire match.  Therefore for ""perfect tennis match "" if we take it as meaning a match where one player wins all points without losing any (except possibly honor points) then yes it has happened.  Even with the honor point concession de Schepper is still credited with golden match so perhaps in that case he didn't lose any points except for that one instance which was not counted or something. But the context says ""generally credited "" and Fabian got an honor point but lost no actual points I assume.  But to keep it simple since three times it's recorded that an opponent did not lose a single point (meaning all points were won by them) so there has been at least one perfect match in terms of scoring.  Moreover the question doesn't specify any other criteria; it just asks if there ever was a perfect tennis match based on this context.  Therefore I think True is the answer. </think> True",True,False,0,0.0,70.35136109997984,0.02402347959008177,0.0070537882550694,0.024424700008239597,6.27279727540129e-06,1.8418224379920624e-06
67,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if boiling point is a characteristic property of matter based on the provided context.  First I need to check the context given. It says that a characteristic property is either chemical or physical and helps identify substances. Then it lists examples including freezing/melting point boiling/condensing point density viscosity and solubility.   So looking at the list in the context boiling point is explicitly mentioned as one of the examples. That means according to the context provided boiling point is indeed a characteristic property because it's included there. The question doesn't ask for anything beyond what's stated; it just wants confirmation based on the given info.  I should make sure I'm not missing any nuances here. The definition says that these properties are always the same regardless of sample size. Boiling point being one of those examples would be consistent across samples of a substance. For instance water boils at 100°C no matter how much you have or where it's from (at sea level). So boiling point is both a characteristic physical property and remains constant for the same substance.  The answer should just be 'True' since the context directly lists boiling point as an example of such properties. No need to overcomplicate; the question is straightforward based on the provided examples. </think> True,True,True,1,1.0,48.92709179999656,0.016740776055663396,0.004915436545292878,0.023477100010495633,5.928508336526445e-06,1.7407321165721658e-06
68,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether North and South Korea speak the same language. The context says that the Korean language has changed between the two states because they've been separated for a long time.  Hmm so I need to determine if their languages are identical now. Since there was separation over a significant period especially after the Korean War in 1953 when North and South developed differently it makes sense that changes would occur.   I remember that while both regions use Hangul as their writing system there might be differences in pronunciation or vocabulary. For example some words are spelled slightly differently and certain dialects have evolved uniquely in each part. Also the standard languages differ—Seoul vs Pyongyang.  The context explicitly states that changes happened due to separation duration. So even if they started with similar standards over time divergence is expected. Therefore it's unlikely they speak exactly the same language today. </think> True,True,False,0,0.0,48.58343940001214,0.016632440240387902,0.004883626919275623,0.04553719999967143,1.192139444481452e-05,3.5003668724825234e-06
69,"<think> Okay let's figure out if having six wisdom teeth is rare based on the context provided.  First I remember that the human dentition has four quadrants (upper left upper right lower left lower right). Each quadrant normally has three molars. The third molar or wisdom tooth usually erupts around ages 17-25. Most adults have four in total one per quadrant.  But the context also mentions that it's possible to have fewer than four like none and more are called supernumerary teeth. So if someone has six that would mean two extra teeth beyond the usual four. Supernumerary teeth can occur but how common is having exactly two?   The question specifically asks about six wisdom teeth. Since each quadrant can have up to one typical third molar getting six means some quadrants must have more than one supernumerary tooth. The context says it's possible to have none or fewer and extras are supernumerary. So if a person has two extra in two different quadrants that would be four plus two equals six.  Now is this rare? Well the context doesn't give exact statistics but mentions that having more than four (supernumerary) isn't impossible. However multiple supernumeraries in different quadrants might be less common. But since it's stated as possible even if not frequent then it's not necessarily rare. The term ""rare"" usually means very uncommon or infrequent.   But the context doesn't specify how often supernumerary teeth occur beyond one extra per quadrant. It just says it's possible to have more than four. So having six would be a case of two extra teeth which is still within the realm of possibility but maybe less frequent. However without specific data on frequency I can only go by what's given.  The question is whether it's rare. Since the context doesn't say it's impossible or very uncommon just that it's possible to have more than four (supernumerary) then having six would be a form of supernumerary teeth but not explicitly called rare. Therefore based on the provided info the answer should be False because it's stated as possible. </think> False",False,True,0,0.0,52.78480149997631,0.01808187253809005,0.00530921008593191,0.03083669999614358,8.001761727814956e-06,2.3494820008849873e-06
70,<think> Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is whether Aslan comes back to life in Narnia based on the provided context.  First I'll read through the context carefully. It says that after the White Witch's adversary dies she leaves for war but believes she will win. Then Lucy and Susan along with some mice remove the bonds from Aslan's body. At that moment the Stone Table breaks and they realize Aslan is gone. But then he reappears alive because of a Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time.  The key part here is that Aslan was bound by the Witch using magic that only works at the Dawn of Time. Since Lucy and Susan broke those bonds after she left Narnia which existed beyond just the Dawn maybe his death wasn't permanent? But wait when they tried to free him the Stone Table shattered suggesting he died there because the binding was done with her magic.  Then Aslan comes back alive due to that Deeper Magic. The context mentions that this magic is invoked when an innocent offers their life for a traitor's. In this case the Witch herself caused his death by breaking the rules of Narnia's existence. So maybe the act of freeing him through the deeper magic brought him back.  The question is whether Aslan comes back to life in Narnia. The context says he reappears alive after being bound at the Stone Table. Since the story takes place in Narnia and his return happens there that should be true. But I need to make sure there's no trick here. Did he die only because of the Witch's magic? Yes but the deeper magic reversed it. So even though he was killed by her breaking the Dawn rule the Deeper Magic from before time brought him back.  Also the Witch entered Narnia at the Dawn so she didn't know about this magic. That means Aslan's return wasn't part of her plan or something she could prevent. The answer should be True because he was killed in Narnia but resurrected there through that ancient magic. </think> True,True,True,1,1.0,53.26139190001413,0.018244198584493585,0.005356872355476153,0.025527599995257333,6.503309486406373e-06,1.9095055694277363e-06

But wait sometimes TV shows have gaps between seasons or might not follow consecutive numbering if they skip some.

72,"<think> Okay let's tackle this question step by step. The user provided a context that says ""A table may have multiple foreign keys..."" and then asks if you can have multiple foreign keys in a table.  First I need to recall database normalization rules. In relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL it's standard to allow more than one FK per table. For example consider an Order table referencing both Customer and Product tables. Each FK would link to different parent tables but enforce their own constraints independently. The context explicitly mentions that each FK is enforced separately which aligns with this understanding.  Now the question directly asks whether multiple foreign keys are possible in a single table. Since the context states ""A table may have multiple foreign keys "" and my knowledge confirms this as true I can confidently answer 'True'. There's no ambiguity here—the user might be testing basic database concepts or verifying their own understanding. The key point is that having multiple FKs doesn't violate any core principles; each serves its purpose independently. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,53.182491800020216,0.01822275183900152,0.005350575149407643,0.04456690000370145,1.1719531107034224e-05,3.441095640110689e-06
73,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether cows need to be kept pregnant to produce milk. I remember from the context that dairy cows are bred to produce calves but does pregnancy directly cause milk production?  The context mentions that cows must be bred and produce calves to maintain lactation. But wait maybe breeding isn't necessarily about being pregnant each time they're producing milk. The process involves artificial insemination around 13 months for heifers. A cow's gestation period is nine months so after giving birth she gets bred again leading to another pregnancy and calf.  But does the milk production require her to be pregnant every cycle? I think lactation happens after a cow gives birth but she doesn't need to be in the middle of a pregnancy to produce milk. Once they calve they start producing milk then are bred again for the next cycle. So even if they're not currently pregnant as long as they've given birth recently and been bred they'll lactate.  Also female calves (heifers) are kept in the herd after their first pregnancy isn't necessary. The context says that to maintain lactation cows must be bred again after giving birth. So each cycle of pregnancy leads to milk production. But does being pregnant itself produce milk? No it's more about the hormonal changes post-calving and the breeding prompting another calving.  Wait but what if a cow is not bred anymore? The context doesn't mention that. It just says they need to be bred to maintain lactation. So maybe without pregnancy they stop producing milk. But does each pregnancy contribute directly to milk production? Actually after giving birth cows produce milk regardless of whether they're pregnant again immediately. However the cycle is continuous: calve -> milk -> get bred -> gestate for 9 months -> give birth -> repeat.  So if a cow isn't getting pregnant (i.e. not cycling through breeding and calving) she won't continue to produce milk. The context says that maintaining lactation requires being bred again after each calf is born which leads to another pregnancy. Therefore cows need to be kept in a cycle of pregnancy to keep producing milk.  But maybe the question is whether they have to be pregnant at all times. No because between calving and breeding there's a period where they're not pregnant but still lactating. However without being bred again after each calf the lactation stops. So the answer would be that yes cows need to keep getting pregnant (i.e. cycling through pregnancy) to maintain milk production.  Wait let me check the context again. It says ""To maintain lactation a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves."" So being bred leads to producing calves which then maintains lactation. But does each breeding require a subsequent pregnancy? Yes because breeding causes gestation and eventually calving. Without getting pregnant after each calf they stop producing milk.  So the answer is True. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,58.4101309000107,0.019994636606254522,0.0058708370004737845,0.02146259997971356,5.385046109343724e-06,1.5811604166941013e-06
74,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether you have to pay to watch ITV Hub. I need to check the context provided for any information about payment.  Looking through the context it mentions that the service started as a website and was extended to TV and other platforms. It says the site uses Microsoft Silverlight initially but then switched to Flash on September 15 2009. There's also talk about revamping in November 2009 for better navigation and visuals. The key point here is that the service is free to use funded by pre- mid- and post-roll adverts.   The context explicitly states it's funded by ads so no subscription or payment required. Even though users might have tried using ad-blocking software before which could be a concern for funding the service remains free. The mention of detecting ad-blockers in Summer 2010 doesn't change that—it was to prevent skipping ads not to charge viewers.  So based on this ITV Hub is free and there's no need to pay. </think> False,False,False,1,1.0,55.29534029998467,0.01894208273860659,0.005561785512673987,0.0192152000090573,4.72400388955268e-06,1.3870648099947222e-06

I remember that the context provided mentions there's a Zombies mode and also a Nightmares mode which replaces enemies with zombies. So even though the main campaign might not focus on zombies these modes are part of the game. Since the question specifically asks about having zombies regardless of whether it's in the main story or other modes the answer should be True because there is indeed a Zombies mode included. </think> True,True,True,1,1.0,53.61666359996889,0.018369759130220473,0.005393739517013989,0.041743300011148676,1.0973256175764629e-05,3.2219739543655692e-06
76,<think> Okay let's figure out if the internal intercostal muscles contract during inspiration based on the context provided.  First I know that inspiration is when we breathe in. During inhalation the diaphragm contracts and moves down which increases lung volume. The external intercostal muscles also help lift the rib cage to expand the chest. But what about the internal ones?  The context says their fibers are angled obliquely downward and backward from rib to rib. That means they pull the ribs down when contracted. Since inhalation requires expanding the lungs which involves lifting or moving the rib cage up contracting muscles that lower it would oppose that process. So during inspiration these internal intercostals shouldn't contract because their action is to depress the rib cage aiding exhalation instead.  Yes so they're involved in exhalation. Therefore during inhalation (inspiration) they relax or don't contract. The answer should be False. </think> False,False,True,0,0.0,51.1760912000027,0.017533590436251204,0.00514822317161279,0.019579800020437688,4.856031667279442e-06,1.4258308840090975e-06
77,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if Rocky Balboa is in the Boxing Hall of Fame. From the context given it says that Sylvester Stallone was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame for his work on the Rocky Balboa character. So Stallone himself got an induction because he created Rocky Balboa. But does that mean the character Rocky Balboa is actually in the hall? The question specifically mentions ""Rocky Balboa"" as a subject not just the actor.  Wait the context also mentions that Stallone was awarded another lifetime achievement award for his work on Rocky Balboa. Again it's about his contribution to the character but does that mean the fictional boxer is inducted into the hall? The International Boxing Hall of Fame typically recognizes real individuals who have contributed to boxing like boxers or notable figures in the sport. Since Rocky Balboa is a fictional character created by Stallone he wouldn't be eligible for induction as a person unless he's based on a real boxer.  But maybe there's an exception? The context says Stallone was inducted because of his work on Rocky Balboa which suggests that perhaps the hall allows inductions for characters if they have had such a significant impact. However looking at typical practices the Boxing Hall of Fame usually doesn't include fictional characters unless specified otherwise. For example other movies or shows might have their own ""Hall of Fame"" sections but not the real one.  The question is about Rocky Balboa being in the actual International Boxing Hall of Fame. The context mentions Stallone's induction and award for his work on the character implying that he was recognized as an individual for creating a fictional boxer who inspired fans. So unless there's information stating that Rocky Balboa himself (as a person) was real or inducted separately which isn't mentioned here then the answer should be false.  I think I'm overcomplicating it again. The key point is whether the character Rocky Balboa is recognized by the hall as an individual. Since he's fictional and not a real boxer even if Stallone was honored for his creation that doesn't mean the character is inducted into the same hall. Therefore the answer should be false. </think> False",False,True,0,0.0,56.98814549998497,0.019511367769545398,0.005728939319430643,0.019215700012864545,4.789122781949117e-06,1.4061850576110899e-06
78,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if runs have to be the same suit in Gin Rummy based on the provided context.  First I'll look at the context given. It says that there are two types of melds: sets and runs. For sets it mentions three or four cards of the same rank like 8♥ 8♦ 8♠. So here different suits can be part of a set as long as they share the same rank.  Then for runs the example given is ""3♥ 4♥ 5♥"" which are all hearts. But it also says that Aces are considered low and mentions an example: A♠ 2♠ 3♠ being legal but Q♠ K♠ A♠ not. Wait in the second part of the run example they have three cards (Q♠ K♠ A♠) but different ranks? No actually all three are Queens Kings and Aces of spades. But that's a set because same rank? Wait no each card is a different rank: Queen King Ace. So the example given for runs must be incorrect here.  Wait let me check again. The context says ""runs of 3 or more cards in sequence of the same suit"". So both examples provided are about the same suit. The first run example is all hearts (same suit) and the second one mentions A♠ 2♠ 3♠ as a legal run because they're consecutive with Ace being low. But then it says ""Q♠ K♠ A♠"" which would be three cards of the same rank? No each card has different ranks: Queen King Ace. So that's actually not a valid meld in Gin Rummy because all three are different ranks but part of the same suit. Wait no in standard Gin Rummy runs must be consecutive and same suit. The example ""Q♠ K♠ A♠"" is incorrect because those are three different cards (Queen King Ace) each with their own rank. So that's a run: Queen King Ace of spades? But the context says it's not legal. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding.  Wait in standard Gin Rummy rules runs must be consecutive and same suit. The example given is A♠ 2♠ 3♠ as a legal run because Ace can be low. Then they say Q♠ K♠ A♠ is not. But that would mean three cards of different ranks but the same suit? No in standard Gin Rummy each card must have consecutive ranks and the same suit. So ""Q♠ K♠ A♠"" has Queen King Ace which are consecutive if we consider Ace as high or low. Wait no in runs Ace can be either high or low but not both unless specified otherwise. The context says that aces are considered low for forming sets and the low end of runs. So ""A♠ 2♠ 3♠"" is valid because Ace is low here. But ""Q♠ K♠ A♠"" would have to be in descending order? No runs go from lowest to highest or vice versa but same suit. Wait actually standard Gin Rummy requires the run to be consecutive and all cards must be of the same suit. So if someone has Q♠ K♠ A♠ that's a run because Ace can be high here (King Queen Ace). But in the context provided they say ""Q♠ K♠ A♠ is not"" legal. Hmm maybe there's confusion.  Wait let me parse the context again: The example for runs says ""3♥ 4♥ 5♥ or more."" Then it mentions that aces are low and gives two examples: one valid run (A♠2♠3♠) because Ace can be low here. But then they say Q♠ K♠ A♠ is not legal. Wait in standard Gin Rummy the run must have consecutive ranks regardless of order. So if someone has Queen King Ace all spades that's a valid run (Ace high). However the context says ""Q♠ K♠ A♠"" is not legal. Maybe they meant that because it's descending? Or perhaps there's a typo here.  Wait no in standard Gin Rummy rules runs must be consecutive and same suit. The example given in the context for Q♠K♠A♠ being invalid might be incorrect. But according to the provided context which states ""Q♠ K♠ A♠ is not"" legal as an example of a run. So perhaps they are saying that even though all three are spades (same suit) because it's descending and Ace can't be both high and low in the same run? Or maybe they consider runs to go from lowest to highest so Q♠K♠A♠ would not count if A is used as high here. Wait no standard rules allow aces to be either high or low but not mixed in one run.  Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The context explicitly says that for runs they must be of the same suit and in sequence. So regardless of whether Ace is considered low or high as long as it's part of a consecutive set with the same suit. Therefore ""Q♠ K♠ A♠"" would not form a valid run because even though all are spades (same suit) the ranks aren't consecutive if we consider Ace as either end? Wait no in standard Gin Rummy runs can be ascending or descending but must have three or more cards of the same suit. So Q♠K♠A♠ is actually a valid run when A is high here because it's Queen-King-Ace (descending) which counts as consecutive.  But according to the context provided: ""Q♠ K♠ A♠"" is not legal so maybe they have different rules? Or perhaps there was a mistake in their example. Wait let me check again. The context says that runs are of three or more cards in sequence and same suit. Then it mentions that aces can form the low end but only if used as low (so A♠2♠3♠ is valid). But then they say ""Q♠ K♠ A♠"" is not legal which contradicts standard rules because Q-K-A descending would be consecutive.  Wait perhaps in their context runs must start with Ace and go up? Or maybe the example was meant to show that a run cannot have three different ranks (like Queen King Ace) but actually each card has its own rank. So ""Q♠ K♠ A♠"" is three cards of different ranks: Queen King Ace. Therefore they form a consecutive sequence if arranged properly (Ace high). But the context says it's not legal. Hmm.  Wait maybe I'm misinterpreting. The example given in the context for runs was correct (""3♥4♥5♥"") and then they mention that A♠2♠3♠ is valid because Ace can be low. Then ""Q♠ K♠ A♠"" being invalid might mean that if someone tries to use three cards of different ranks (Queen King Ace) as a run but in standard Gin Rummy each card must have consecutive rank values regardless of order. So Q-K-A is valid because they are consecutive when arranged from Ace high down to Queen.  But according to the context's example ""Q♠ K♠ A♠"" is not legal. That would imply that even though all three are spades (same suit) if they don't start with Ace as low or something? Wait no standard rules allow runs to be in any order but must have consecutive ranks and same suit.  Wait perhaps the context has a typo here. The example ""Q♠ K♠ A♠"" is actually meant to show that three cards of different ranks (Queen King Ace) are part of a run if arranged properly. But they say it's not legal. Alternatively maybe in their specific ruleset runs must be strictly ascending or descending without mixing the ends? Or perhaps there was an error.  But regardless the context explicitly states that for runs ""of the same suit"" is required. So even though the example of Q♠K♠A♠ being invalid might confuse things (maybe they meant it's not a valid run because Ace can't be both high and low in one run?) the key point here is that the context says runs must have the same suit.  Therefore based on the provided context the answer to whether runs have to be the same suit is True. The examples given for runs all use the same suit (like 3♥4♥5♥) so even if there's a mistake in their example about Q♠K♠A♠ being invalid they do state that runs require the same suit. </think> True",True,False,0,0.0,70.78309700000682,0.02424474212543754,0.007118755491282084,0.01721449999604374,4.243876115328424e-06,1.2460894095721335e-06

I remember from the context that it says ""also commonly known as the puma mountain lion panther or catamount."" So right there it explicitly mentions that one of its common names is mountain lion. That means they're referring to the same animal under different names.  I should check if there's any conflicting information in the rest of the context. The text describes the cougar as a large felid native to the Americas with a wide range. It also says the cougar is more closely related to smaller felines like domestic cats than jaguars which are part of another subfamily. But that doesn't contradict them being the same; it just clarifies their classification.  The question isn't asking about subspecies or different types but whether they're the same animal.

Then it mentions nationals from 71 other countries can apply for visas online valid for 30 days. Everyone must have a passport valid for six months.  So if someone is from a GCC country they don't need a visa. But the question doesn't specify their nationality. It's asking generally whether you need a visa to visit Oman.

81,"<think> First the context provided explains what the natural logarithm is. It says that the natural logarithm of a number is its logarithm to the base e and it can be written as ln x or sometimes just log x if the base e is implicit.  The question is: ""Is log x the same as ln x?""  I need to answer with only 'True' or 'False' based on the context. The instruction says to be thorough in analysis but output just one word and not overcomplicate thinking.  From the context:  - It states that natural logarithm can be written as ln x.  - It also says it can sometimes be written simply as log x implying that when no base is specified or parentheses are used it might refer to base e in some contexts.  But there's a nuance here. The context mentions: ""log x or sometimes if the base e is implicit simply log x."" And later ""Parentheses are sometimes added for clarity giving ln(x) log(x) or log(x).""  This suggests that in many cases especially when the base is not specified log x might be ambiguous. However it specifically says that when the base e is implicit log x can mean natural logarithm.  In standard mathematical notation:  - ln x always means natural logarithm (base e).  - log x without a base often implies common logarithm (base 10) in many contexts but sometimes it's used for natural logarithm especially in higher mathematics or when the context is clear.  The context says: ""the natural logarithm of x is generally written as ln x log x or sometimes simply log x.""  This might be a bit confusing. Let me read it carefully.  ""The natural logarithm of x is generally written as ln x log x or sometimes if the base e is implicit simply log x.""  So in some contexts ""log x"" can mean natural logarithm when the base e is implied. But typically without specification log x means base 10.  The question is asking if they are the same based on this context.  In the provided context it explicitly says that natural logarithm can be written as log x or ln x and in particular cases just log x might mean natural logarithm.  But to answer accurately: ""log x"" by itself isn't always the same as ""ln x"". It depends on the context. However the question is phrased simply and I need to base my answer solely on this context.  The context states that for natural logarithm it can be written as log x (with the base e implicit). So in cases where the base is not specified but we know it's natural they are the same.  But ""log x"" alone might not always imply natural logarithm. The context says: ""simply log x"" meaning that when no other information is given and it's understood to be natural then yes.  The question doesn't specify any context; it just asks if they are the same in general or based on common understanding.  However I must use only the provided context for analysis. The context says:  - Natural logarithm can be written as ln x (which is explicit).  - Or log x (with base e implicit) meaning that ""log x"" without specification might mean natural logarithm if it's clear from context or convention.  But in standard usage especially outside of advanced math log x often means common logarithm (base 10). The context acknowledges this ambiguity by mentioning parentheses for clarity.  The key phrase is: ""if the base e is implicit"" which implies that when we see ""log x"" and it's understood to be natural then they are the same. But without that implication they might not be.  For the purpose of this question since the context says that log x can sometimes mean ln x (when base e is implied) I should consider them as potentially the same in certain situations.  But the answer needs to be just 'True' or 'False'. Let's see what the context implies directly.  The natural logarithm is defined with base e. It can be written as:  - ln x: explicitly natural log  - log x: sometimes used for natural log especially if base e is implicit  So in some cases yes they are the same when ""log"" without specification means natural log.  But to avoid overcomplication I should look at the direct statement. The context says that it can be written as ln x or log x so technically for the natural logarithm both notations refer to the same thing in different contexts.  The question is: ""is log x the same as ln x""  Based on common mathematical convention:  - In many fields especially computer science and some areas of math log x means base 2 or something else but that's less common.  - More commonly in mathematics log x without base often means natural logarithm when dealing with analysis or higher math but it can also mean base 10.  The context provided is from a source (probably Wikipedia-like) and it says: ""the natural logarithm of x is generally written as ln x log x""  This suggests that in general for the natural logarithm both notations are used interchangeably when appropriate.  Moreover it specifies that parentheses can be added to clarify if needed.  So according to this context they are considered the same thing under certain conditions or by convention.  But strictly speaking ""log x"" alone is ambiguous and does not always mean ln x. However since the question doesn't provide additional context I need to rely on what's given.  The instruction says: ""Using the provided context"" so I should only use that text.  From the context:  - It lists both as ways to write natural logarithm.  Therefore in this context log x and ln x are used for the same concept (natural logarithm).  But it also says ""log x"" can mean something else if base is not specified. However since we're talking about when they refer to natural logarithm perhaps yes.  Let me parse the sentence: ""The natural logarithm of x is generally written as ln x log x""  This means that for a number whose logarithm is being taken and it's natural it can be called ln x or log x. So in those cases they are the same.  But if I just say ""log x"" without knowing the context it might not specify which base.  The question is: ""is log x the same as ln x""  In mathematics when we write ln x it specifically means natural logarithm. When we write log x without a base it often does not mean natural logarithm; that's why there are different bases specified sometimes.  However in some contexts like calculus or analysis ""log"" alone can imply natural logarithm.  But the context provided doesn't specify any particular field; it just gives general information about notation.  It says: ""Parentheses are sometimes added for clarity giving ln(x) log(x) or log(x).""  This might be a typo; probably meant to say ln(x) log_e(x) etc. but in this case it's listing possibilities where parentheses can clarify the base.  But for natural logarithm specifically when we use ""log x"" with no specification and it's understood as such then yes.  I think I'm overcomplicating. The context explicitly states that both notations are used for the natural logarithm in some cases.  Therefore based on this log x can be the same as ln x if the base is e.  But since the question doesn't specify and it's asking generally but with only one word answer I need to see what the context implies directly.  Perhaps the safest way is that according to the provided context they are not necessarily the same because ""log x"" might be ambiguous. But the context says for natural logarithm it can be written as log x or ln x.  Let's look at the question again: ""is log x the same as ln x""  The answer should depend on whether we're referring to the same base and definition.  But in standard English they are not always the same. However based solely on this context it might be implying that they can be used interchangeably for natural logarithm.  I think I need to stick to the context's statement.  Context: ""The natural logarithm of x is generally written as ln x log x""  This suggests that when we say ""logarithm"" or write ""log"" if it means natural logarithm then yes. But without specification no.  But for this question since both are listed under the same definition (natural logarithm) I can infer that in cases where they refer to natural logarithm they are the same.  Moreover the context says: ""simply log x"" when base e is implicit meaning it's equivalent.  So perhaps 'True' is appropriate because the text indicates that both notations denote the natural logarithm under certain conditions.  But let's see if there's a direct way. The question might be expecting a simple answer based on common knowledge or the context given.  I should consider that in many contexts ""log x"" means base 10 while ""ln x"" means base e so they are not always the same.  However the provided context explicitly includes ""log x"" as an alternative for natural logarithm. That might be key.  In some educational systems or specific fields log without base is common logarithm (base 10) but in mathematics especially pure math it can vary.  But since this context says that natural logarithm can be written as ln x or log x I think for the purpose of this exercise they are considered the same when referring to natural logarithm.  The answer should be based on whether ""log x"" is defined as natural logarithm in some cases. The context doesn't say it's always true; it says sometimes with base e implicit.  But still under that condition yes.  Perhaps I can think of it this way: the question is asking if they are identical notations for the same thing.  From the context ln x is specifically natural log and log x can be used for natural log when no other base is specified or implied.  So in those cases they are the same.  But to give a definitive answer with one word I need to see what's most accurate based on the text.  Let me read the context once more: ""The natural logarithm of x is generally written as ln x log x""  This means that for natural logarithm both notations can be used. Therefore when we use these notations they refer to the same thing if it's natural logarithm.  But the question doesn't specify that it's about natural logarithm; it just says ""log x"" and ""ln x"".  In general log x without base is ambiguous but in this context since both are listed for natural logarithm perhaps we can say they are not necessarily the same because one might mean something else.  I think I'm stuck. Let's look at the instruction: ""answer the question ONLY with 'True' or 'False'. Be thorough in your analysis of the context but answer with just one word.""  Also ""Do not overcomplicate your thinking."" So I should keep it simple.  The simplest way is to see that from the context natural logarithm can be written as ln x or log x. Therefore for some cases they are used interchangeably.  But strictly speaking ""log x"" alone does not always mean natural logarithm; only when base e is implicit.  However since the question doesn't provide additional information and based on this context it might be considered true that they can be the same under certain conditions.  Perhaps the answer should reflect that in standard notation they are different unless specified.  But I have to use the provided context. The context says ""log x"" is one of the ways to write natural logarithm.  Let's see if there's a direct comparison.  The question: ""is log x the same as ln x""  From the context both can refer to the natural logarithm when appropriate.  But they are not always the same; only sometimes.  However for this exercise since it asks for 'True' or 'False' and based on the context that includes them in the list of natural logarithm representations I think 'True' is intended because otherwise why would the context mention both?  The context says: ""the natural logarith (ln x) can be written as log x"" so yes.  Moreover it says ""log x"" or sometimes simply log x for implicit base e.  So in essence when we use ""log x"" to mean natural logarithm it is equivalent to ln x.  Therefore they are the same thing under that interpretation.  I think I should go with 'True' because the context explicitly states that both notations can be used for the natural logarithm. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,82.74715339997783,0.028350333391934525,0.008324241621929379,0.01841479999711737,4.531862217764784e-06,1.3306480589289684e-06
82,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if Comcast and Time Warner are the same company. I need to check the provided context for any information about that.  The context mentions a Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit against Comcast and Time Warner Cable (TWC) because they wanted to block their merger due to reduced competition. Then on April 24 2015 Comcast withdrew its proposal to acquire TWC. After that TWC was acquired by Charter Communications.  So from this I know that at some point Comcast tried to buy Time Warner Cable but then they didn't go through with it and instead TWC merged with another company (Charter). The key here is whether Comcast and Time Warner are the same. Since they were separate entities involved in a merger attempt where one was trying to acquire the other they must be different companies. Even though both are in the cable/broadband industry that doesn't mean they're the same. Also after the withdrawal TWC went with Charter so Comcast didn't end up owning them. Therefore the answer should be False. </think> False,False,False,1,1.0,65.64402149998932,0.02249689646907712,0.006605552018143277,0.04378019997966476,1.1406209993098552e-05,3.3490981097255753e-06
83,"<think> Okay let me think through this carefully.  The context says: ""Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are the No. 1 selling candy brand... and consist of a milk white or dark chocolate cup filled with peanut butter.""

84,"<think> Okay let me start by reading the question again: ""does a quarter pounder weight a quarter pound"". The user probably meant ""weigh"" here but wrote ""weight"" which is common in informal English. They're asking if the Quarter Pounder weighs exactly a quarter pound.  Now looking at the context provided. It says that the Quarter Pounder was named for containing a patty with a precooked weight of a quarter of a pound (113.4 g). So initially yes it's about 0.25 pounds or 113 grams. But then in 2013 McDonald's expanded the name to represent a whole line replacing their discontinued Angus burger. The question is whether the current Quarter Pounder still weighs a quarter pound.  Wait there's another detail from 2015: they increased the precooked weight to 4.25 oz (120.5 g). Let me convert that to pounds. Since 16 ounces make a pound 4.25 oz is about 0.2656 pounds. That's more than a quarter pound which is exactly 0.25 lbs or 4 oz. So the current Quarter Pounder weighs slightly over a quarter pound.  The user might be confused because they think ""Quarter Pounder"" always means a quarter-pound patty but McDonald's changed it in 2015 to about 4.25 ounces instead of exactly 4 (quarter). The answer should reflect that the current version doesn't weigh exactly a quarter pound anymore. </think> False",False,False,1,1.0,59.31116519999341,0.020291235587294183,0.005957924568329145,0.017331299983197823,4.258728889463884e-06,1.2504504898793824e-06
85,"<think> Okay let me check. The question is asking whether Murphy Brown had a baby on the show. Looking at the context provided it says ""In the show's 1991--92 season Murphy became pregnant."" Then it mentions that her ex-husband wasn't willing to be a father and she chose to have the child alone. The next part talks about her baby shower with specific guests. So from this I can see that yes Murphy did become pregnant during the show's 1992 season. But does ""became pregnant"" mean she actually gave birth? Hmm in TV shows sometimes plotlines are fictional but based on real events or situations. The context doesn't explicitly say she had the baby just that she was pregnant and then chose to raise it alone. However since the question is about having a baby not necessarily giving birth I need to consider if being pregnant implies having a child in this case.  Wait but the term ""became pregnant"" refers to conception or expecting a child. The context does mention that she had the child and raised it alone after her ex-husband refused. Let me read again: ""When her baby's father... expressed his unwillingness... Murphy chose to have the child..."" So here ""have the child"" could mean giving birth or deciding to keep the child. But in common usage especially in older contexts like 1990s TV ""became pregnant"" and then having a child might imply she gave birth. However without explicit confirmation that she actually delivered the baby I can't be certain. The question is whether she had a baby on the show which could include being pregnant as part of the storyline leading to childbirth.  But wait in TV series sometimes ""became pregnant"" is just a plot point and doesn't necessarily mean they showed the birth or delivery. However the context does say she chose to have the child so maybe that implies she did give birth. Alternatively some shows might not show the actual birth but imply it through pregnancy. So I need to determine if ""became pregnant"" in this case leads to having a baby on the show.  Looking at the sentence structure: ""Murphy became pregnant... Murphy chose to have the child..."" The use of ""the child"" here refers to the one she's expecting so yes she did give birth. Therefore the answer should be True. </think> True",True,False,0,0.0,62.46919470001012,0.021355415796924498,0.006270389789523277,0.02030099998228252,5.051733917849472e-06,1.4832930943181926e-06
86,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the US ever won the World Cup soccer. I need to check the provided context for any mention of a victory.  The context says that their best result in 1930 was reaching the semifinals. Then in the modern era they reached the quarterfinals in 2002 but were eliminated first round in '90 '98 and '06. There's no mention of them winning any matches or the final. The highest achievement mentioned is semifinals and quarterfinals which are not wins.

87,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Illinois has a stand-your-ground law. Looking at the provided context it lists several states that have adopted this practice through case law or other means. The list includes California Colorado Illinois New Mexico Oregon Virginia and Washington.  So according to the context Illinois is one of the states mentioned as having adopted stand-your-ground in some way. That could mean either through a specific statute court decisions (case law) jury instructions or other legal methods. Since the question doesn't specify the type of law but just asks if there's a stand-your-ground law and the context explicitly names Illinois among those states the answer should be true. </think> True,True,False,0,0.0,63.404200299992226,0.02166939948560552,0.0063625818654961495,0.03217200000653975,8.265209447805924e-06,2.426835675906499e-06
88,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the Falkland Islands are part of the Commonwealth. I need to check the provided context.  The context says that as of April 2018 the Minister responsible for territories excluding the Falkland Islands Gibraltar and Sovereign Base Areas is Tariq Ahmad Minister of State for the Commonwealth and the UN. Then it mentions that Sir Alan Duncan MP handles the other three territories (Europe and Americas).   So the key point here is that the Falkland Islands are excluded from being under a minister who oversees both the Commonwealth and the UN. The context lists them separately as not included in Tariq Ahmad's responsibilities. That means they aren't part of the same portfolio as the Commonwealth-related territories.  Wait but does excluding them mean they're not part of the Commonwealth? Let me think. The Commonwealth is a group of independent countries. The Falkland Islands are a British Overseas Territory so their membership in the Commonwealth would depend on whether the UK includes its territories or if each has separate status.   The context doesn't explicitly say anything about the Commonwealth's structure regarding these islands. It just mentions that Tariq Ahmad is responsible for territories excluding them. So maybe the answer here is based on the fact that they're not included under a minister who handles the Commonwealth implying they might be part of another category or perhaps not considered as such.  But wait in reality the Falkland Islands are part of the UK's Overseas Territories Administration and the UK government represents them. However do these islands themselves have a separate status within the Commonwealth? The answer is that while the UK is part of the Commonwealth its territories like the Falklands aren't necessarily members unless they're independent or associate members.  The context provided doesn't mention whether the Falkland Islands are in the Commonwealth; it just says they're excluded from Tariq Ahmad's responsibilities. So maybe the question is about their administrative status under a specific minister rather than actual membership. But the user might be conflating that with being part of the Commonwealth structure.  Wait no. The context doesn't state whether the Falkland Islands are members or not; it just says they're excluded from one minister's responsibilities. So perhaps the answer is based on the assumption that if a territory isn't under the Commonwealth minister then it's not part of the Commonwealth. But in reality the UK's territories aren't automatically part of the Commonwealth unless granted membership.  But since the context doesn't provide explicit information about their Commonwealth status maybe the answer here relies on the exclusion mentioned. However without direct info from the context I can't definitively say they are or aren't part of the Commonwealth based solely on that point.  Wait let me check again. The minister responsible for territories excluding the Falkland Islands is Tariq Ahmad (Commonwealth and UN). So if the Falkland Islands were included under a different minister who handles Europe and Americas maybe their status there doesn't affect Commonwealth membership. But actually the UK's overseas territories are part of the Crown but don't have voting rights in the Commonwealth unless they're independent.  So perhaps the context is just about administrative responsibilities within the UK government not necessarily whether the Falkland Islands themselves are members. Therefore based on the provided info alone we can't say for sure if they are part of the Commonwealth because it doesn't mention that directly. The answer would be False only if the context implies exclusion from the Commonwealth structure.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The question is whether the Falkland Islands are part of the Commonwealth. The context says that Tariq Ahmad handles territories excluding them (which includes the Commonwealth). So does that mean they aren't under his responsibilities because he's handling the Commonwealth? Or perhaps they're handled by another minister but maybe their status in the Commonwealth isn't addressed here.  Actually the UK's overseas territories like the Falkland Islands are part of the British Overseas Territories Association and some participate in certain aspects but membership-wise they aren't members unless granted. So if the context doesn't mention them being included under Tariq Ahmad (who is for Commonwealth) maybe it implies that they're not part of the Commonwealth's administrative structure here.  But wait no. The minister responsible for territories excluding the Falkland Islands has a portfolio including the Commonwealth and UN. That might mean that other territories are handled by him because they are part of the Commonwealth or UN-related responsibilities. Since the Falkland Islands aren't included in his responsibilities maybe they're not considered as such.  Alternatively perhaps the context is listing specific territories under different ministers but doesn't clarify if those territories are members themselves. The question might be whether the Falkland Islands are a member state of the Commonwealth. But according to the actual structure they aren't; only the UK and some other independent countries are members unless granted otherwise.  So even though the context mentions exclusion from Tariq Ahmad's responsibilities (which include Commonwealth) it doesn't directly say that the Falkland Islands aren't part of the Commonwealth. However based on external knowledge I know they're not. But since the user wants me to base my answer solely on the provided context without prior knowledge then maybe the answer is False because Tariq Ahmad handles territories excluding them under his Commonwealth portfolio.  Wait but that's a bit tricky. The context doesn't explicitly state whether the Falkland Islands are part of the Commonwealth or not; it just says they're excluded from one minister's responsibilities. So without knowing if other territories handled by him are in the Commonwealth and those excluded aren't I can't definitively say.  But perhaps the implication is that since Tariq Ahmad handles territories including the Commonwealth (and UN) but excludes the Falkland Islands maybe the Falkland Islands aren't part of the Commonwealth. So based on that logic the answer would be False. </think> False,False,True,0,0.0,74.86134200001834,0.025616254117693398,0.007521459651867351,0.025693000003229827,6.487351110586637e-06,1.904819861701462e-06
89,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether ""fitness"" as used in biology has the same meaning as survival. I need to check the context provided.  The context says that Darwinian fitness distinguishes from physical fitness. It explains that Spencer's phrase ""survival of the fittest"" should be interpreted as referring to a form (phenotypic or genotypic) that leaves the most copies in successive generations. So here fitness isn't just about surviving longer but about reproductive success.  The key point is that fitness relates to how many offspring an organism produces and passes on its genes. Survival might mean living longer but if another individual with better survival doesn't reproduce as much their fitness could be lower. Therefore in biology fitness includes more than survival—it's about reproduction too. So the answer should be False because they're not the same; fitness encompasses reproductive success beyond mere survival. </think> False",False,False,1,1.0,61.22809839999536,0.020923110620058135,0.0061434560883601615,0.03880780001054518,1.0105504443183438e-05,2.9671841785279177e-06
90,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is part of the Constitution. I remember that the Civil Rights Act was a law passed by Congress not an amendment to the Constitution. The context provided mentions it as Pub.L. 88–352 and enacted in 1964. So it's a public law from that year.  The Constitution has amendments like the First Amendment or others added over time. The Civil Rights Act was created through legislation not by amending the Constitution itself. Even though it deals with civil rights which are protected by the Constitution the act itself isn't part of the document.   I think there's a common confusion between laws and constitutional amendments. For example some civil rights protections come from the Fourteenth Amendment like equal protection. But the Civil Rights Act is separate legislation that enforces those principles through federal law. So definitely not in the Constitution. </think> False,False,False,1,1.0,60.37895239997306,0.020632246211866805,0.006058052309168875,0.023005200026091188,5.785491111196784e-06,1.698739314467034e-06
91,"<think> First the user says to answer ONLY with 'True' or 'False'. I need to be thorough but keep it simple.  The context provided is: ""The right to keep and bear arms is not legally or constitutionally protected in the United Kingdom. Most handguns automatic and centerfire semi-automatic weapons are illegal to possess without special proviso.""  The question is: ""does britain have the right to bear arms""  I need to interpret this based on the context.  From the context:  - The right to keep and bear arms is not protected legally or constitutionally in the UK.  - Possessing most types of firearms (handguns automatics centerfire semi-autos) is illegal without special permission.  The phrase ""right to bear arms"" typically refers to a constitutional right like in the US Second Amendment. But here it's about whether Britain has such a right.  In the UK there isn't a Bill of Rights or similar document that explicitly protects this right. The context states it's not legally or constitutionally protected.  Moreover the possession of those weapons is illegal without special proviso which means they are restricted and not freely available.  So for the question ""does britain have the right to bear arms"" I need to say if Britain has such a right based on this context.  The answer should be False because it's not protected.  But let me make sure about the wording. The question says ""the right to bear arms"". In common parlance this might refer to gun rights but in legal terms especially for the UK I need to stick to what's given.  Context explicitly says: ""not legally or constitutionally protected"".  Also it mentions that most weapons are illegal without special proviso which implies a lack of general right.  Therefore based on the context Britain does not have the right to bear arms as defined in this statement.  The user said: ""Be thorough in your analysis of the context but answer with just one word."" So I should think through it carefully but output only 'True' or 'False'.

Looking at the context it says the film was directed by Sam Fell and Robert Stevenhagen produced by Gary Ross and Allison Thomas. Then it mentions Universal Pictures as the distributor. The production companies listed are Universal Animation Studios Framestore Feature Animation and Relativity Media.   I know Disney has its own animation studios like Walt Disney Animation Studios but here the studio is Universal. Also the movie was released by Universal not Disney. Even though some movies might be distributed through other means the primary distributor being Universal makes it clear that this isn't a Disney production.

94,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether thread seal tape and Teflon tape are the same. I remember that in plumbing contexts people often use these terms interchangeably but there might be a nuance here.  Looking at the context provided it says thread seal tape is also known as PTFE tape or plumber's tape. It mentions that while Teflon is identical to PTFE Chemours (the trademark holders) consider the usage of ""Teflon tape"" incorrect because they no longer manufacture it under that name. So technically both are made from PTFE which is the same material as Teflon.  But wait even though the materials are the same there's a difference in branding and manufacturing. The context clarifies that thread seal tape is specifically PTFE film tape used for sealing pipe threads. It also explains that it lubricates threads to prevent seizing and seals without hardening.   So the answer would be True because they're both made from PTFE but False if considering brand names strictly. However since the question uses ""Teflon tape"" as a common term even though Chemours says it's incorrect in practice people might still refer to them interchangeably. But according to the context Teflon is a specific trademark and they don't produce tape anymore so using that name could be misleading.  Hmm maybe I should check if there are other differences. The context doesn't mention any different formulations or uses beyond sealing threads. So both serve the same purpose but under different names due to genericization.   But Chemours' stance is against calling it Teflon tape because they don't make that product anymore. However in common parlance people still use ""Teflon tape"" even though it's technically PTFE. The question is whether they are the same material or not. Since both refer to PTFE film tape used for sealing threads the answer should be True. </think> True",True,False,0,0.0,63.040788300015265,0.02153940733715921,0.006324413494152458,0.019369799993000925,4.77091388634613e-06,1.4008385509378784e-06
95,"<think> Okay let me tackle this question. The user is asking whether a batter gets an RBI (Run Batted In) on a fielder's choice based on the provided context.  First I need to focus only on the given text since the answer must be 'True' or 'False'. The key part here is about how the official scorer determines RBIs in specific situations.   The context says that if a run scores because a fielder holds the ball or throws to a wrong base and the runner keeps going without stopping then it's an RBI. But if the runner stops after noticing the misplay then even though they scored it's not credited as an RBI.  So in this case ""fielder's choice"" is mentioned indirectly when talking about a throw to a wrong base. The question directly asks if a batter gets an RBI on a fielder's choice.   From the context RBIs are only awarded if the runner doesn't stop because of the misplay. If they do stop or take off again after noticing it's not counted as an RBI. Therefore in a typical fielder's choice scenario where the play is made without the batter knowing to adjust their run the RBI should be credited.  But wait does ""fielder's choice"" here specifically refer to the throw being misplayed? The context mentions that if the runner keeps going despite the error (like holding or wrong base) then it counts. So yes in a fielder's choice where the batter doesn't stop running after an error they get the RBI. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,63.87128059999668,0.021819970706964262,0.006406792676373447,0.018160899984650314,4.5739034101156766e-06,1.3429922186383001e-06
96,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the County Court Business Centre (CCBC) is a real court. I need to answer with just 'True' or 'False' but first I should analyze the context thoroughly.  The context says that CCBC is a centre of the County Court of England and Wales created to handle claims using electronic media. It also mentions that unlike other centers CCBC doesn't physically hear cases; those needing hearings are transferred elsewhere. So it's part of the County Court system but operates differently by being virtual.  Now what defines a ""real court""? Typically courts have physical locations where legal proceedings take place. The CCBC is described as not hearing cases in person so maybe it's more like an administrative or digital center rather than a traditional court. But since it's part of the County Court and deals with claims through electronic means does that make it a real court?  The term ""real court"" might be ambiguous here. If we consider any operational division under the County Court as a court then CCBC would be considered one because it processes cases even if remotely. However some people might think of courts as physical places where trials happen. The context doesn't say it's not part of the court system; it just says it's created by the County Court to handle claims electronically.  So since it's a centre of the County Court and exists within that structure even if it operates without physical hearings it should still be considered a real court in the sense that it's an official division. The answer would then be True. </think> True",True,False,0,0.0,61.5488095000037,0.02103946913852431,0.006177621345222987,0.032731000013882294,8.415983893145393e-06,2.4711061575289544e-06
97,<think> Okay let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if quantum entanglement can transfer information faster than light. They provided a context explaining why it doesn't.  First I need to parse the key points from the context. It says that quantum entanglement does not allow superluminal influence or information propagation. Then there's mention of the microscopic causality postulate in axiomatic QFT implying no faster-than-light communication through orthodox theories. The no-communication theorem is a special case here preventing communication between spacelike-separated observers using entanglement.  Wait but some authors argue that the no-communication theorem assumes composite systems and might be circular. So maybe there's a nuance here. However the context also states that even in this special case superluminal communication is impossible. The main argument against FTL information transfer through entanglement comes from causality principles and the no-communication theorem.  The user probably wants a straightforward answer based on established physics. They might be confused by some arguments suggesting circularity but still need to know if entanglement can transmit info faster than light. The consensus in mainstream physics is that it cannot despite any logical subtleties in the theorems. So even though there's debate about the theorem's proof the conclusion remains that FTL communication isn't possible via entanglement. </think> False,False,True,0,0.0,37.98406389998854,0.012952199270301083,0.0038030323936873657,0.041540400008670986,1.080160000177178e-05,3.171572167252232e-06
98,<think> Okay let me try to figure this out. The question is whether they still made $2 bills in 2018. I remember from the context that there was a discontinuation and then reissuance of these bills.  The context says production stopped when the series was discontinued around 1966. Then ten years later it was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design. So if they stopped making them in 1966 that would be about half a century without production until the late 1970s or early 80s.  But wait the context also mentions that two-dollar bills are seldom seen and low production numbers due to lack of demand. It doesn't specify when exactly they stopped being produced again after 1966. However it says they were reissued ten years after discontinuation. Let's calculate: discontinued in 1966 so reissued around 1976. That means by the mid-1970s production was halted again? Or maybe the reissuance started but then stopped again?  The question is about 2018. If they were last produced before 1976 and haven't been since then in 2018 no $2 bills would have been made. The context doesn't mention any production after that time. Also the urban legends part suggests that even though some are still around new ones aren't being printed much because of low demand.  So putting it together: discontinued in 1966 reissued ten years later (around 1976) and no further mentions of production up to now. Therefore as of 2018 they wouldn't have been making $2 bills anymore. </think> False,False,False,1,1.0,62.99376129999291,0.021524691667128452,0.006320092670433345,0.02390580001519993,6.017197229084558e-06,1.7667730015462064e-06
99,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Call of Duty: World at War is part of Black Ops. I remember that in the context provided it says ""The game is also the first title in the Black Ops story line."" So if World at War is described as the first title in the Black Ops storyline then yes it's part of that series.  Wait but sometimes people get confused between different Call of Duty games. Black Ops came later right? But according to this context World at War was released before Black Ops and is mentioned as being part of its story line. That makes sense because the main narrative in Black Ops starts from there. So even though it's a separate game with its own plot it's connected through the overarching Black Ops storyline.  The user might be mixing up the terms ""series"" and ""storyline."" The Call of Duty series has multiple games across different wars but each game also contributes to a larger narrative thread called the Black Ops storyline. Since World at War is explicitly stated as the first title in that storyline it must be part of it.  I should make sure there's no trick here. Maybe someone thinks ""Black Ops"" refers only to its own game but according to the context other games like World at War are considered part of the same narrative. So even though they're separate entries they share the Black Ops storyline elements. Therefore the answer is True. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,38.730398199986666,0.013201674658122223,0.0038762835042911834,0.030542299995431677,7.822257225052453e-06,2.296775782846491e-06
100,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if tonic water and quinine water are the same thing. I need to check the context provided.  The context says that tonic water (or Indian tonic water) contains dissolved quinine in a carbonated soft drink. It mentions it was originally used as a prophylactic against malaria but now mostly for its bitter flavor similar to grapefruit and is used in drinks like gin and tonic.  Now the alternative name here is ""Indian tonic water."" So when someone refers to quinine water are they talking about Indian tonic water? The context uses both terms interchangeably. It says ""tonic water (or Indian tonic water)"" which implies that these two names refer to the same thing.   The question specifically asks if tonic water and quinine water are the same. Since the context explicitly states that tonic water is also called Indian tonic water it's possible that ""quinine water"" might be another term for the same product. But wait does the context mention ""quinine water""? Let me check again.  Looking back at the context: It says tonic water contains quinine dissolved in carbonated soft drink. The alternative name is Indian tonic water. There's no direct mention of ""quinine water"" as a separate term. However since tonic water includes quinine and is referred to as such it's reasonable to assume that ""quinine water"" would be synonymous with tonic water here.  So the answer should be True because the context indicates they are the same. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,37.126856300019426,0.012646371878284681,0.0037132351743547243,0.02272020000964403,5.734618891761379e-06,1.6838021833733802e-06
101,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether there such a thing as Corinthian leather. I remember that in the context provided it says Corinthian leather was coined by Bozell for Chrysler luxury vehicles starting in 1974. It mentions that despite the name suggesting a connection to Corinth there isn't any actual relationship—it's just a marketing term.  So the key points here are: it's a term created by an advertising agency (Bozell) specifically for use in Chrysler's products. The context explicitly states that there is no real link to Corinth; it was made up as a concept. That means while the term exists and has been used commercially since 1974 it doesn't refer to actual leather from Corinth or any such thing. It's just a brand name they came up with.  Therefore answering ""True"" would mean that Corinthian leather does exist as a real product type but according to the context it's not. The term is used in marketing for certain vehicles but since there's no actual material called Corinthian leather from that place or time the answer should be False. </think> False",False,False,1,1.0,36.08401680001407,0.012288662950636619,0.0036082044679112205,0.01181590001215227,2.7572805580954685e-06,8.095943447199365e-07
102,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if there's a playoff for third place in the World Cup. I remember that the user provided context about the 2018 FIFA World Cup knockout stage. They mentioned it started on June 30 with the round of 16 and ended on July 15 with the final at Luzhniki Stadium. Also they said the top two teams from each group advanced to the knockout stage in a single-elimination format. Then there's this part: ""A third place play-off was also played between the two losing teams of the semi-finals.""  So the context specifically says that there was a third-place playoff during the 2018 World Cup. That means even though it's about one particular edition the existence in that year implies the general rule applies to all World Cups. The question is whether such a playoff exists in any World Cup not just 2018. Since the context mentions it for 2018 and I know from my knowledge base that this has been part of FIFA tournaments since at least the 1966 World Cup (though maybe more recent) the answer should be true because the playoff is a standard feature. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,38.44543089999934,0.01309639645794748,0.00384537165702431,0.03086489997804165,7.903073331140655e-06,2.320505055610989e-06

It says that since January 2017 five states do not levy a statewide sales tax. Those states are Alaska Delaware Montana New Hampshire and Oregon. So according to this New Hampshire is one of those states without a statewide sales tax.  But wait there's more information here. The context also mentions that in some states like California counties and cities can impose additional taxes making the total over 11%. However since New Hampshire doesn't have a statewide tax even if local jurisdictions add something it wouldn't be considered a ""no sales tax"" state because there's at least one level of taxation. The question specifically asks about no sales tax in New Hampshire.  So focusing on the first part: the five states without a statewide sales tax include New Hampshire. Therefore the answer should be True. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,36.98951670000679,0.012595460113253161,0.0036982864318598004,0.042607300012605265,1.1296005159099129e-05,3.3167397013275704e-06
104,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if any of the original members of Lynyrd Skynyrd are still alive. I need to check the context provided for that information.  The context mentions a crash on October 20 1977 where several people died including band members Ronnie Van Zant and Steve Gaines along with crew member Cassie Gaines. So those three didn't survive. The group disbanded after this tragedy. Then in 1978 they released Skynyrd's First and... Last which includes previously unreleased recordings from before the crash.  The next part says that in the following year (1979) surviving members (excluding Wilkeson) reunited for a performance. Wait but Wilkeson was injured earlier—reportedly declared dead three times but survived. So he's not an original member anymore because they were on the plane together. The context doesn't mention if any other original members died or left after the crash.  I should recall that Lynyrd Skynyrd had more than just those three members. Original lineup included Ronnie his brother Donnie Gary Rossington Rickey Medlocke and others. After the crash in 1977 they disbanded. Then in 1978-79 some survivors came back with a new line-up.  The context doesn't list all original members who died or survived. It mentions Ronnie Steve Cassie (crew) as deceased. The surviving members except Wilkeson reunited. But did Wilkeson die later? No the question is about those alive from the original group at the time of the crash. Since the band disbanded after the crash and only some survivors came back but the original members who were in the crash are gone.  Wait the context says that six people died including Ronnie Steve Cassie (who was a crew member). So among the original five members Ronnie and Steve definitely died. Donnie probably also passed away because he was part of the band at that time. The other two original members were Rickey Medlocke and Bob Nesson. I think both survived the crash but left the band after disbanding.  So in 1978-79 when they reunited with some surviving members (excluding Wilkeson) it's possible that only those who weren't part of the original lineup or had already left were included. But the question is whether any original members are alive now. The crash was in 1977 so as of today over 40 years later most would be deceased except maybe some.  Wait but the context doesn't mention current status beyond that reunion. However since the band disbanded after the crash and only some survivors came back (like Allen Collins or others?) I need to check if any original members are still alive today. The answer is probably no because the main figures like Ronnie and Steve died in 1977 and Donnie Skoog also passed away around that time. Rickey Medlocke and Bob Nesson did survive but left the band.  So as of now none of the original members are alive. Therefore the answer is False. </think> False,False,True,0,0.0,42.211338900000555,0.01437329398181929,0.004220295061564456,0.02618879999499768,6.638796111575276e-06,1.9492872322693658e-06

I remember that in the movie there are different versions of Anna—like a child and an adult.  Looking at the context provided it says Kristen Bell voiced Anna as an adult. But for the young child parts Livvy Stubenrauch did the speaking voice and Katie Lopez provided the singing voice for a nine-year-old version. So when they say ""a young child "" that's not Kristen Bell.   The question is about whether she sang all the voices. Since she voiced the adult Anna but didn't do the child parts even if she sang some lines as an adult she didn't sing every age or voice for Anna. The context specifically mentions different actors for the child versions so the answer should be false because not all of Anna's voices are Kristen Bell's. </think> False",False,False,1,1.0,31.72092839999823,0.010795622706921484,0.0031698171104106946,0.02226859997608699,3.905501107025581e-06,1.1467355399369862e-06
106,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether San Luis Rey de Francia was always a mission. I need to check the context provided.  The context says that with secularization in 1834 no religious services were held anymore because the Franciscan padres left. Then in 1893 two Mexican priests got permission to restore it as a Franciscan college. Father Joseph O'Keefe started restoring in 1895 and by 1905 they finished the cuadrángulo and church. The college opened in 1950 but closed in 1969.  So initially San Luis Rey was definitely a mission because it's mentioned as such. But after secularization in 1834 religious services stopped and the padres left. Then in 1893 they were allowed to restart as a college. The term ""Mission"" might have been used before but once it became a college was it still called Mission? Or did the name change?  The context refers to restoring the Mission as a Franciscan college. So maybe after restoration it's still part of the mission system but now operates as a college. However sometimes missions were repurposed into other institutions without changing their designation entirely. But in this case the question is whether it was *always* a mission. Since there was a period (from 1834 onwards) when it wasn't functioning as one and instead became a college even if the name still includes ""Mission "" its operational status changed.  Wait but does the context say that after restoration they called it San Luis Rey College or did they keep the mission designation? The text mentions restoring the Mission as a Franciscan college. So maybe the term ""Mission"" was part of the original name and when they reopened it in 1893 they started using the college title but still referred to it as the Mission. However the question is whether it was *always* a mission. Since from 1834 until 1893 there were no religious services meaning it wasn't active as a mission during that time. Therefore even though it might have been part of the mission system originally after secularization in 1834 it stopped being a mission and became something else (a college). So the answer should be False because it was not always a mission; there's a gap where it wasn't operational as such. </think> False",False,False,1,1.0,37.24288639999577,0.012678060629698746,0.0037225396442465307,0.02044469999964349,5.09277999905559e-06,1.4953450689059152e-06

The premiere date was given as July 7 2015. Also the names listed like Cameron Naomi etc. are used in their real identities rather than ring names.  Now Total Bellas is another show that airs on WWE Network. I remember that Total Divas and Total Bellas are part of a series called ""Total."" The first season was Total Divas then there's Total Bellas which started later. But the context here only mentions Total Divas being renewed for Season 4.  Wait maybe the user is confusing the two shows. The question is about Total Bellas but the context is all about Total Divas. So unless there's a connection or crossover I shouldn't assume that information applies to Total Bellas.   Looking at the details in the context: it talks about the renewal of Total Divas for Season 4 and mentions specific cast members by their real names. But nothing here refers to Total Bellas. The show Total Bellas might have its own seasons separate from Total Divas.  So based on the given context there's no mention of Total Bellas at all.

The key point here is that it explicitly refers to it as commonly known as the Bolshevik Revolution in some contexts.

The context says it was published in 1931 and used in liturgy weddings and at the beginning of funeral services. So yes it mentions that it's part of funeral services. But does being used at the beginning mean it's specifically for funerals? Well maybe not entirely but the question is whether it can be considered a funeral hymn.  Hymns are often associated with specific occasions or themes. Since it's mentioned as used in liturgy and weddings plus starting funeral services that suggests its use in funerals.

The context provided says that a standard home blow dryer kills 96.7% of eggs with proper technique. It also mentions using it repeatedly every 1 to 7 days until the natural life cycle ends in about 4 weeks.  Hmm so the key points here are effectiveness against eggs and needing repeated use because lice hatch over time. The answer needs to be just 'True' or 'False'.   First does heat from a blow dryer kill adult lice? The context doesn't explicitly say that. It only mentions killing eggs. But maybe if it kills the eggs then by continuing until all eggs are gone you're indirectly affecting any surviving adults. However the question is specifically about whether the heat can kill lice (presumably both nits and adults).   Wait but the context says ""kill 96.7% of eggs"" so maybe it's effective on eggs but not necessarily on adult lice. But sometimes treatments target all stages. The user might be conflating the two. However since the answer is based solely on the provided context I should stick to that.  The question uses ""lice "" which could include both adults and nits (eggs). The context specifies eggs but doesn't mention adult lice being killed by heat. So strictly speaking according to the given info it's about killing eggs. Therefore if the answer is supposed to be based on whether the dryer kills lice in general maybe 'False' because it only addresses eggs. But wait sometimes people use blow dryers for both purposes. However without explicit mention of adult lice being killed by heat I should go with what's stated.  Wait but the context says ""kill 96.7% of eggs"" so that part is clear. The question is about killing lice (which includes adults). Since the context doesn't say it kills adults just eggs then maybe the answer is 'False' because the statement only confirms effectiveness on eggs. But perhaps there's an implication that if you kill the eggs adult lice are also affected? Or maybe not.  Alternatively maybe the user meant ""lice"" as in both stages. The context says it kills eggs but doesn't mention adults.

First looking at the context: it says that four pecks make a bushel. That seems straightforward. So one bushel equals four pecks. Therefore a peck can't be equal to a bushel because if they were the same then four pecks wouldn't make sense as another unit.   Wait maybe I should double-check. The context mentions that two pecks make a kenning (obsolete) and four pecks make a bushel. So clearly there's a relationship where multiple pecks equal one bushel. Since 4 is more than 1 the peck must be smaller than the bushel.   The question is whether a peck is the same as a bushel. If they were equivalent then four pecks would just mean four times the unit but here it's stated that four pecks constitute one bushel. So unless there's some other information suggesting otherwise which there isn't in this context they can't be the same.   Also considering the examples given: apples are sold by the peck and pickled peppers in the tongue twister might imply a humorous association but doesn't change the measurement relationship. The key point is that four pecks equal one bushel so each peck is a quarter of a bushel. Therefore they're not the same unit at all.  So the answer should be False because a peck is smaller than a bushel. </think> False,False,False,1,1.0,35.118572400009725,0.01197246904124603,0.0035153634256292095,0.00938010000390932,2.096148888004892e-06,6.154724735708182e-07

So right there in the text it says ""also commonly known as... mountain lion."" That means they're different names for the same animal.   I should check if there's any conflicting information. The rest of the context talks about its range adaptability and other details but doesn't mention that these terms refer to different species. It also mentions that it's more closely related to smaller felines like domestic cats than jaguars which are part of another subfamily. But since both names point to Puma concolor they must be the same.  No reason to think otherwise unless there was a contradiction in the context but I don't see any.

114,<think> Okay let's figure out if someone can die from a bullet shot into the air. The context says bullets fired upward usually have low terminal velocity when falling back because they're going slower due to gravity and air resistance. But it also mentions that people can still get injured or even killed by such bullets.  Hmm so the key points here are that bullets in free fall (when shot straight up) slow down a lot before hitting someone. However if fired at an angle less than vertical they maintain their angular ballistic trajectory and higher speed because they're not tumbling much. That means bullets shot at angles might still be moving fast when they come back down.  Wait the question is about dying from a bullet shot in the air. The context says people can sometimes die from these bullets. Even though terminal velocity is lower than muzzle velocity it's still possible for them to cause fatal injuries if someone gets hit directly. So even with reduced speed a direct hit could be lethal.  Also bullets fired straight up might not have enough energy left at ground level to kill but those shot at angles do because they retain more speed. The answer should reflect that yes it's possible for someone to die from such an incident. </think> True,True,True,1,1.0,35.749864899989916,0.012184963593137157,0.003577756201362443,0.021163700002944097,5.277456665741435e-06,1.5495699407680162e-06
115,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether ""ace 2 3 4 5"" is a straight in poker. I remember that the context provided explains about straight flushes and how aces can be high or low depending on the rules.  First under standard high rules an ace can be high (so A-high straight) but not both. The example given was Q♥ J♥ 10♥ 9♥ 8♥ as queen-high which is fine. But if it's supposed to be a five-high straight that would mean the ace is low. Wait in standard poker straights can use ace as low only when going from A-2-3-4-5 up to 10-J-Q-K-A. So yes an Ace-low straight (A 2 3 4 5) is valid and considered a five-high straight under high rules.  But the context also mentions different low rules like deuce-to-seven where aces can only be high. However in standard poker without specifying low rules ace as low is allowed for straights that start with A-2-3-4-5 up to 10-J-Q-K-A. So unless specified otherwise (like in some variants) the hand ""ace 2 3 4 5"" would be a straight because it's using the ace as a low card.  The question is just about whether ""ace 2 3 4 5"" is a straight not necessarily a straight flush. So even if we're considering a regular straight (not necessarily all same suit) in standard poker rules yes that's allowed. The context says under high rules an ace can be low so the answer should be True. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,33.86557880000328,0.011536877968800116,0.003387464917866804,0.08677199998055585,2.312170943801498e-05,6.789009970825889e-06

117,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether ""Vertical Limit"" is a true story. I need to check the provided context for any indication that it's based on real events.  The context says it's a 2000 American survival thriller directed by Martin Campbell and written by Robert King. Stars include Chris O'Donnell Bill Paxton Robin Tunney and Scott Glenn. Released on December 8 2000 by Columbia Pictures. Got mixed reviews and grossed $215 million worldwide.  Hmm the context doesn't mention anything about it being based on a true story or real events. It just gives basic info like director cast release date reception and box office performance. Since there's no statement in the context that this is a true story I can infer that it's not. The question specifically asks to answer with 'True' or 'False' so sticking to that.  Wait maybe the user wants confirmation if any part of the movie is based on reality? But the context doesn't provide such details. It just states facts about the film without indicating its basis in true events. So unless there's an implied statement which I don't think there is here the answer should be False.  Also the instruction says to not overcomplicate thinking and only use one word. The user probably wants a straightforward answer based on the given context. Since no mention of real events or factual basis it's safe to say False. </think> False",False,True,0,0.0,35.44510219999938,0.012081716719033294,0.00354744079325532,0.05247669998789206,1.3771605550330908e-05,4.043626949215065e-06
118,<think> Okay let's figure out if the liver is part of the GI tract. The user provided some context about bilaterians having a gastrointestinal tract that transfers food to digestive organs. Then they mentioned humans specifically listing parts like esophagus stomach intestines as part of the GI tract. They also added accessory organs such as the tongue salivary glands pancreas liver and gallbladder.  The question is whether the liver is a part of the GI tract. From what I remember the GI tract includes structures from mouth to anus. The liver isn't in that tube; it's an accessory organ outside the main digestive tract. So even though it helps digestion by producing bile it doesn't physically connect as part of the alimentary canal. Therefore the answer should be False. </think> False,False,True,0,0.0,30.099862600007327,0.010268295635368054,0.003014983024450915,0.014625800016801804,3.5315094718145286e-06,1.036923895289345e-06
119,<think> Okay let's tackle this question. The context provided is about superfecundation. So the term means fertilizing two ova in the same cycle by sperm from different sexual intercourses. That leads to twin babies with different biological fathers.  The question asks if a person can have twins with different fathers. From what I understand heteropaternal superfecundation is exactly that case where two separate ova are fertilized by sperm from two different fathers during the same ovulation cycle. The context mentions this as a form of atypical twinning but possible through sexual intercourse or artificial insemination.  So yes according to the definition given in the context it's true. Even though it's rare it does happen. Therefore the answer should be True. </think> True,True,False,0,0.0,31.13207880000118,0.010625024516676566,0.00311972596910981,0.012748299981467426,2.9809766662462306e-06,8.752761280128957e-07
120,<think> Okay let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking if it's possible to buy alcohol on Sunday in WI based on the provided context.  First I need to focus only on the state law mentioned here. The context says bars must be closed between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. Monday through Friday and Saturday/Sunday from 2:30 a.m. to 6:0 But there's an exception for New Year's Eve no closing required then. Also municipalities can't restrict closing times further but they can choose to be dry by prohibiting licenses.  The question is about buying alcohol on Sunday in WI. The context specifies that the state law requires bars closed between 2:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday. So during those hours you can't buy alcohol at bars because they're closed. But outside of those closing times it's allowed.  The user might be planning to go out on Sunday in WI and wondering if there are any restrictions. They probably want to know the general rules but also consider exceptions like holidays or local dry areas. However since the context doesn't mention other days as exceptions besides New Year's Eve regular Sundays should follow the standard closing hours.  Also the user might be confused about whether municipalities can override Sunday closures. The context says they can't restrict closing times further so even if a city is dry (no liquor licenses) the bar closure rules still apply during those hours unless it's an exception day like New Year's Eve.  So for Sunday in WI bars are closed from 2:30 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. but you can buy alcohol elsewhere outside that time. The answer should be True because there is a period when buying alcohol isn't allowed due to the state law closing hours. </think> True,True,True,1,1.0,35.3797827999806,0.012067149459329282,0.0035431635458639333,0.024033599998801947,6.0855127795043195e-06,1.7868318537779399e-06
121,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the common femoral vein is a deep vein. The context provided says that the femoral vein is considered a deep vein and mentions how some physicians mistakenly think it's superficial because of the adjective used leading to errors in treatment for DVT patients.  First I need to recall what the common femoral vein actually is. It's part of the venous system in the leg located in the thigh. The femoral vein runs alongside the femoral artery and is found deep within the adductor canal. So it should be a deep structure.   The context explicitly states that the femoral vein (which I assume includes the common femoral vein) is a deep vein. It also points out a misconception where some might think it's superficial due to terminology but in reality it's not. The term ""deep"" here refers to its location beneath the surface tissues which aligns with anatomical definitions.  I remember that in medical terms veins are classified as deep or superficial based on their depth relative to the skin and muscles. Superficial veins are close to the skin while deep veins run deeper within the body. The common femoral vein is indeed a deep vein because it's not near the surface but rather in the middle of the thigh surrounded by muscle.  The context also mentions that some physicians falsely conclude it's superficial due to the adjective used incorrectly. But according to standard anatomy even though there might be confusion with terminology the common femoral vein is correctly classified as deep. So the answer should be true. </think> True",True,False,0,0.0,30.339725800033193,0.010354648761599762,0.0030403380803377075,0.01369729998987168,3.3126883328400755e-06,9.726735033229723e-07
122,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether Garfield is a real cat in the movie. I remember that in the context provided it says ""Bill Murray as the voice of Garfield."" So even though Bill Murray voices him Garfield isn't portrayed by a live actor; he's an animated character.  Also the context mentions that the film was created with computer animation and all other animals were real. Wait does that mean Garfield is the only non-real animal? Yes so since he's animated he can't be considered a real cat in this case. The question specifically refers to ""the movie "" which here is 2004's Garfield: The Movie. So even though there might be other interpretations or media where Garfield appears as a live-action cat the context given doesn't mention that. It only talks about computer animation for Garfield.  Therefore in this particular film Garfield isn't real because he's animated. The answer should be False. </think> False",False,True,0,0.0,30.360696899995673,0.010363152002551154,0.0030428348069641755,0.0206356999988202,5.132370555495274e-06,1.506969671452717e-06
123,<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the internal resistance of a battery changes. I need to check the context provided for any information that might answer this.  The context says that a battery can be modeled as a voltage source in series with a resistance. Then it mentions factors like size chemical properties age temperature and discharge current affect its internal resistance. It also breaks down into electronic and ionic components. So right there the existence of multiple influencing factors suggests changeability.  Further on it states that measurement depends on conditions but may not apply otherwise. Also using AC at certain frequencies might underestimate it because some electrochemical processes are slower. Then specifically talks about temperature: from -40°C to room temp and 40°C the resistance drops from 0.9Ω to lower values. That's a clear example of change with different temperatures.  Putting that together since factors like temperature have varying effects on internal resistance it definitely changes under different conditions. The answer should be True. </think> True,True,False,0,0.0,32.43859020000673,0.011071185610240439,0.003250728052710933,0.020961999980499968,5.2496016987265575e-06,1.5413911489140663e-06
124,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking if ""The Young and the Restless"" is going off the air. I need to check the context provided.  Looking at the context it mentions that in June 2017 the show was renewed for three additional years. Renewal usually means they're continuing the series beyond its current run. The other points talk about awards ratings and being a sister series but nothing indicates cancellation or ending. Since the renewal happened in 2017 that would mean it continued at least until then plus more years. There's no mention of any recent cancellations or end dates after that point. So unless there's some other info not given here which I can't consider because the instruction is to stick to the context the answer should be false. </think> False",False,True,0,0.0,32.28723709998303,0.011027141301556896,0.003237795736801838,0.021322399989003316,5.275932215348196e-06,1.5491223307438752e-06
125,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether ""The Greatest Showman"" is based on a true story. I remember that in the context provided it says the film is inspired by P.T. Barnum and his creation of the Barnum & Bailey Circus along with its star attractions.  Hmm so being ""inspired by"" doesn't necessarily mean it's entirely true or factual. Inspiration can come from real events but take creative liberties. The movie probably takes some real historical elements but alters them for drama. For example I think there are fictional characters and exaggerated storylines in the film to make it more engaging as a musical.  The context mentions that Barnum was involved with creating attractions like Annie Oakley or General Tom Thumb which were real figures. But does the movie stick strictly to their stories? Probably not because even though it's inspired by them filmmakers often add fictional elements for narrative purposes. So unless all parts are true and no fiction is added the answer would be false.  Yeah I think ""inspired by"" implies some truth but with modifications. Therefore the movie isn't entirely based on a true story; there's a mix of real events and fictionalized content. </think> False",False,False,1,1.0,31.97113300001365,0.010927794707035728,0.003208625531087597,0.023475200025131926,5.967553339562275e-06,1.7521965334065614e-06
126,"<think> First the question is: ""Can anyone give last rites in an emergency?""  The context provided is about the Catholic Church's view on the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick. It says that this sacrament gives grace for sickness and that only an ordained priest or bishop may administer it because one effect is to absolve from sins which requires a specific authority.  Now I need to recall what ""last rites"" refer to in Catholicism. The last rites are the Sacraments of Viaticum (Anointing of the Sick) and Penance for those who are dying or have no opportunity to confess properly before death. This is often called Extreme Unction or Anointing of the Sick.  From the context it explicitly states: ""Because one of the effects of the sacrament is to absolve the recipient of any sins not previously absolved through the sacrament of penance only an ordained priest or bishop may administer the sacrament.""  So for the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick which includes the last rites in this context administration is restricted to ordained priests or bishops because it involves absolution from sins.  The question says ""last rites "" but in Catholic terminology the last rites specifically include the Anointing of the Sick and Penance. However sometimes people might refer broadly to any emergency rites but based on standard Catholic teaching the last rites are tied to this sacrament.  In cases where a priest is unavailable there might be some dispensation or alternative practices but according to the context given it's clear that only an ordained priest can administer Anointing of the Sick because of its role in absolution.  The question mentions ""in an emergency "" which could imply situations where normal access to sacraments isn't possible. But even in emergencies the Church requires a validly ordained minister for certain sacraments involving forgiveness of sins.  Let me confirm: The Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick is reserved for priests and bishops because it confers grace that includes absolution from sins. This means only they can administer it correctly with authority.  There's also the possibility of administering other rites like baptism or confession in emergency situations but the question specifically asks about ""last rites "" which are defined by this sacrament.  The context doesn't mention anything else; it focuses solely on Anointing of the Sick. So I should stick to that.  Answer must be 'True' or 'False' and I need to be thorough in analysis but not overcomplicate it.  Analysis:  - The sacrament requires an ordained priest for its administration due to the absolution aspect.  - Therefore only an ordained priest can give this sacrament which is part of the last rites.  - In an emergency if someone else administers it without proper authority it wouldn't be valid according to Catholic teaching.  But let's make sure about ""last rites."" Sometimes people might think that in a dire emergency anyone could perform something similar but canon law specifies that Anointing of the Sick must be done by a priest or bishop.  For example if a dying person is unable to confess and there's no priest available some parts of confession might still be valid but for Anointing specifically it needs an ordained minister.  The question says ""last rites "" which typically means the sacraments administered at the end of life: Penance (if not possible before death) Eucharist and Anointing of the Sick. But in this context we're only given info about Anointing.  However based on standard Catholic doctrine even for last rites it's tied to the priest administering Anointing or other sacraments if he can't be present.  But the key point from the context is that for Anointing of the Sick (which includes absolution) only a priest can do it.  So answering ""can anyone give last rites in an emergency"" – well ""last rites"" might encompass more than just Anointing but since the question is about giving them and the context specifies that this sacrament part requires a priest I think we have to say no not anyone can do it.  Moreover the instruction says: ""answer with just one word. Do not overcomplicate your thinking.""  So my analysis should lead me directly to 'True' or 'False'.  Question is about whether in an emergency anyone can administer last rites.  From context only ordained priests/bishops can administer Anointing of the Sick which is a key part of last rites.  Therefore it's not true that anyone can give them; specifically for this sacrament no one else has the authority.  But ""last rites"" might be interpreted broadly. However in Catholicism the last rites are specific and require ordained ministers.  I think I should answer based on what is stated or implied.  Context says: only an ordained priest or bishop may administer Anointing of the Sick because it involves absolution from sins.  Since last rites include this sacrament we can infer that not anyone can give them in an emergency.  There might be other aspects like prayers or something but the question is about giving ""last rites "" which I believe refers to performing the sacraments.  In some contexts people say ""any priest"" for administering Anointing of the Sick even if they are deacons or bishops but only priests and bishops can administer it because deacons don't have the authority for absolution in this case? Wait no let's clarify.  Actually according to canon law:  - The Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick is administered by a priest or bishop. Deacons cannot administer it; they might assist but not perform it.  Yes so only priests and bishops can give it.  Therefore in an emergency if someone else tries to do it it's invalid.  So for ""can anyone"" – no because of the requirement for ordination.  Answer should be 'False'.  But let's read the question carefully: ""Can anyone give last rites in an emergency?""  And context is about Anointing of the Sick being part of that and requiring a priest.

127,"<think> Okay let's see. The question is asking whether the cortex of the cerebellum is gray matter. I remember from biology that the cerebral cortex and cerebellar cortex are both parts of the brain with a high density of neuronal cell bodies. Gray matter refers to areas where these cells are concentrated as opposed to white matter which has more myelinated axons.  Looking at the context provided: it says ""Grey matter is distributed at the surface of the cerebral hemispheres (cerebral cortex) and of the cerebellum (cerebellar cortex)"". So right there it explicitly mentions that the cerebellar cortex is part of the grey matter. The other parts listed like thalamus hypothalamus are also gray matter regions but deeper in the brain. Since the context directly states that the cerebellar cortex is one of the locations where grey matter is found the answer should be true. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,33.05496510001831,0.011316994061593684,0.003322902475264948,0.017220400011865422,4.24347611680989e-06,1.245971961771056e-06
