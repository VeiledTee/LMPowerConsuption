3,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's ever been a Duke of Sussex before. Hmm the question is asking specifically about the title ""Duke of Sussex."" I know that titles like dukedoms are hereditary in some cases especially in the UK peerage system.  First I remember that Prince Harry was made the Duke of Sussex after his wedding to Meghan Markle. That's recent so he's definitely a current holder of the title. But before him was there someone else with that title?  I think about the British monarchy and the various dukedoms. There are well-known ones like Duke of Cambridge (which is Prince William) or Duke of York (Prince Andrew). But Sussex seems less common.  Wait I recall something about the Dukedom of Sussex being created before. Maybe in the 19th century? Let me think... Oh yes I believe King George III created the title for his son Prince Augustus Frederick who was later known as the Duke of Sussex. That was in 1803 if I'm not mistaken.  So that means there have been two Dukes of Sussex: the first one being Prince Augustus Frederick and the second being Prince Harry. Therefore yes there has been a Duke of Sussex before Prince Harry. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,10.677222600003006,0.00338495113575681,0.0009938913501623995,0.0,0.0,0.0
2,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Air Force One is typically escorted by fighter jets. Let me start by recalling what I know about Air Force One. It's the official aircraft used by the President of the United States right? Security must be a top priority for such a high-profile and important transport.  I remember seeing movies where Air Force One is shown with fighter planes flying nearby like in ""Air Force One"" (1997) or other action films. That makes me think that it's common practice to have fighter escorts when the President is on board. But I'm not entirely sure if this happens every time or only under certain circumstances.  I should consider the different scenarios where Air Force One might fly. For domestic flights maybe they do use fighter jets as escorts for security reasons. What about international flights? Do other countries provide fighter escorts when Air Force One is over their airspace? I'm not certain about that but it's possible that arrangements are made.  Also during takeoff and landing having fighter jets nearby could help in case of any emergencies or threats. It makes sense from a security standpoint to have these escorts as a precautionary measure.  I should also think about recent events or news articles I've come across. There have been instances where Air Force One was escorted by fighters especially during times when there's heightened security or when the President is traveling to sensitive areas.  On the other hand maybe sometimes the flight doesn't require fighter escorts perhaps for shorter domestic trips or when the route is considered low-risk. But I think generally given the importance of the mission and the safety of the President Air Force One would usually have fighter jet escorts.  So putting it all together my initial thought is that yes Air Force One does fly with fighter escort especially during takeoff landing and when traveling over areas where security might be a concern. It's a common practice to ensure the safety of the President and those on board. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,13.216665800049668,0.004268740174249744,0.0012533900092265217,0.0,0.0,0.0
0,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the World Cup has ever been decided by a penalty shootout. Let me think about this step by step.  First I know that the World Cup is a major international football tournament held every four years. The final match determines the champion and usually it's decided by who scores more goals in regular play or extra time if needed.  I remember hearing that some finals have gone into extra time but not necessarily penalties. For example the 1966 World Cup final between England and Germany was a classic and I think they settled it with goals during extra time not penalties.  Wait wasn't there a recent World Cup where the final went to penalties? Maybe in 2018? Let me recall. Yes in 2018 France played against Croatia in the final. The game was very close and after extra time it ended 2-2. Then they had a penalty shootout and France won. So that's one instance.  But before that I'm not sure if any other finals went to penalties. Maybe earlier tournaments? Let me think about some historical finals. For example the 1986 World Cup final was between Argentina and Germany. Argentina won in extra time with a goal from Maradona I believe. No penalties there.  The 2006 World Cup had Italy vs. France in the final. They played extra time but I think it ended 1-1 after that so they went to penalties. Yes Italy won the shootout making them champions. So that's another example.  Wait so actually yes there have been multiple World Cup finals decided by penalty shootouts. The user is asking if it has happened at all not how many times or specific instances. Since I can think of a couple of examples where the final was decided by penalties the answer should be True. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,17.883629599993583,0.005893988304516721,0.0017305963244009378,0.0,0.0,0.0
10,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Central Bank of India is a nationalized bank. Let me start by understanding what each term means.  First ""Central Bank"" typically refers to the main banking institution of a country responsible for monetary policy and regulating the financial system. In many countries this is an official or government entity. For example in the United States it's the Federal Reserve; in the UK it's the Bank of England.  Now ""nationalized bank"" means that the bank is owned by the government. This usually happens when a private or other type of bank is taken over by the state to ensure financial stability or to provide universal services. Nationalization can involve the government taking control through purchase or by assuming ownership.  I know that in India there have been several nationalizations of banks. For instance during the 1960s and 1970s the Indian government nationalized many private banks to establish more control over the financial sector and to ensure better access to banking services across the country.  The Central Bank of India specifically... I think it's one of the older banks in India. It was established in 1921 as a private bank. However during the wave of nationalizations in 1956 many banks were taken over by the government. The Central Bank of India was indeed nationalized at that time.  So putting this together: The Central Bank of India is a central bank which means it's the primary banking institution for the country. It was also nationalized meaning the government owns and controls it. Therefore yes it fits both categories. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,19.24450020000222,0.006381979960687172,0.0018738807224815605,0.0,0.0,0.0
4,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's a Line of Duty series 4. Hmm I'm not super familiar with the show but I think it's a British police drama. Let me try to recall what I know.  I remember that Line of Duty is produced by the BBC and it's been on for several seasons. Each season usually has a few episodes right? The main characters include someone named DIAC or something like that... Oh wait maybe it's DCI Mathieson? Or was that another show?  Wait I think each series has a different storyline but some recurring characters. Series 1 had something to do with the police force and corruption. Then there were more series after that. I'm pretty sure they released at least three or four seasons.  Let me try to remember specific details. There's a character named Tommy ""Tyrone"" Johnson played by Adrian Lester. He was in some of the earlier series. Then there's another character maybe called Steve Arnott? Yeah he's been around for several seasons too.  I think the show has been renewed multiple times. I'm pretty sure they did at least four series because each one gets more intense and popular. Maybe even five or six? But I'm not 100% certain about the exact number of series released so far.  Wait maybe I can think about when it was last on TV. The latest season I remember seeing was a few years ago but I don't know if they've made more since then. Since it's been around for a while it's possible there are multiple seasons including a fourth one.  So putting this together yes I believe there is a Line of Duty series 4 because the show has had several seasons and each season builds on the previous ones with new storylines and character developments. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,24.68487699999241,0.00828754043970847,0.0024333925149279067,0.0,0.0,0.0
9,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Meredith has a baby in Grey's Anatomy. Let me think about what I know from the show. Meredith is one of the main characters right? She's been through a lot especially with her personal life and relationships.  I remember that she had a relationship with Derek Shepherd who was another main character. They got married but then he died in a plane crash during season 10. That was really sad for the fans. After his death Meredith went through a tough time dealing with her grief.  Now about having a baby... I don't recall any storyline where Meredith became pregnant or had a child while Derek was alive. They were married but there wasn't an immediate focus on them starting a family as far as I remember. Then after Derek's death Meredith seemed to be focusing more on her career and her personal healing rather than having children.  I should also consider if there are any flash-forwards or future episodes where Meredith has a baby. From what I know the show doesn't have many scenes that jump too far into the future so it's less likely that there's an episode showing her with a child. However in some of the later seasons especially as the show continues sometimes characters do have children or other life events.  Wait wasn't there an episode where Meredith mentions something about having a baby? I'm trying to remember... No I think she didn't. Maybe it was another character who had a child instead. For example I know that Cristina Yang had a daughter with her husband and Callie Torres had a son with Arizona Robbins.  So putting this together Meredith hasn't had a baby on the show as of now. She's been through a lot especially losing Derek but there's no indication that she has a child in the series. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,26.170385199977318,0.008805997854111966,0.0025856222869207563,0.0,0.0,0.0
1,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the UEFA Champions League final is just one game or if it's more than that. Let me think about this step by step.  First I know the UEFA Champions League is a big football competition in Europe. It involves multiple teams from different countries. The structure of the tournament probably includes several rounds before reaching the final.  I remember that the Champions League starts with group stages where teams are divided into groups and play against each other. Each group plays a certain number of matches and then based on their performance they qualify for the knockout stage.  In the knockout stage there are rounds like the Round of 16 Quarterfinals Semifinals and then the Final. So to get to the final teams have to win several games through these stages.  Therefore the final itself is just one match where two teams compete for the title. It's not a series of games but a single game determining the champion. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,29.871517799969297,0.010104350366452066,0.002966845317836956,0.0,0.0,0.0
8,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if anyone has ever climbed the North Face of Everest. Let me start by recalling what I know about Mount Everest and its climbing routes.  Mount Everest is the highest peak in the world located between Nepal and China. The most famous route for climbing it is the Southeast Ridge from the south side which is controlled by Nepal. However there's another major face called the North Face which is part of the mountain on the Chinese side.  I remember hearing that the North Face is considered one of the most challenging routes because of its steepness and harsh conditions. It's also known as the ""Stern Route"" or the ""K2 Route "" but I think that might be a different peak. Anyway the key point is that it's a difficult climb.  I'm trying to recall if any notable expeditions have successfully summited via this route. I know that many climbers attempt Everest each year but not all routes are equally popular or successful. The North Face might be less frequently climbed because of its difficulty.  Wait wasn't there an expedition in the 1960s? Maybe the British tried it and failed which led them to try the Southeast Ridge instead. Then in more recent times I think some teams have managed to summit via the North Face but it's still extremely challenging.  I'm trying to remember specific names or expeditions. There was a Japanese team that attempted it in the 1980s if I recall correctly. Also there might have been some successful summits by various international climbers over the years though it's not as common as the standard routes.  So putting this together yes people have climbed the North Face of Everest but it's a rare achievement due to the extreme conditions and technical difficulty involved. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,31.482047500030603,0.010654399619760994,0.003128351104213633,0.0,0.0,0.0
6,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if ""Pokémon Let's Go Eevee"" is a spin-off. Hmm first what defines a spin-off? A spin-off is usually a work that comes from an existing series but focuses on different characters or settings. It can be a movie TV show video game etc.  Now ""Pokémon Let's Go Eevee"" is part of the Pokémon franchise right? I remember it was released around 2019. Wait wasn't there another version with Pikachu instead of Eevee? So maybe they released two versions: one where you start with Eevee and another with Pikachu.  I think these games are set in a similar world to the main Pokémon series but have some differences. They were on the Nintendo Switch I believe. The gameplay might be different too; perhaps more streamlined or targeting younger players.  Are spin-offs considered separate from the main series? Sometimes they're seen as part of an expanded universe. So if ""Let's Go Eevee"" follows a similar structure but with a new character (Eevee) and maybe some changes in how you catch Pokémon it could be a spin-off.  Wait but I'm not entirely sure. Some might argue that these games are more like enhanced remakes of older titles rather than spin-offs. For example if they're based on the original ""Pokémon Yellow"" game which had Pikachu as the starter then Eevee version would be similar but with a different starting Pokémon.  So is it a spin-off or an enhanced remake? If it's using existing lore and just changing the starter maybe it's not a full spin-off but more of a variation. However since it's a new game on a new platform it might still count as a spin-off because it diverges from the main series' structure.  I'm leaning towards yes it is a spin-off because it introduces a different starting Pokémon and gameplay mechanics that set it apart from the core series games. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,38.927112700010184,0.01327276107230862,0.0038971559391773446,0.0,0.0,0.0
7,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the dog from Little Rascals is still alive. First I should remember which dog that was. The show had several dogs over the years but the most famous one was Rascal himself right? Wait no Rascal was a human character. The main dog in the show was named ""Rascal "" but actually I think his name might have been different. Maybe it's ""Bucky"" or another name.  Wait no I'm confusing things. Let me think again. Little Rascals is a live-action comedy series that originally aired in the late '90s and early 2000s. The main character was a boy named Rascal played by Scotty Miller. There were several dogs on the show but one of them became quite famous. I believe the dog's name was ""Bucky"" or maybe ""Rascal.""   I think the most notable dog was Bucky who was a co-star in some episodes. But wait wasn't there another dog that was more prominent? Maybe it's better to check which dog is being referred to when someone mentions the dog from Little Rascals.  Alternatively perhaps the question refers to the character ""Rascal "" but he's human. So maybe the dog's name was ""Bucky."" I should confirm this. If Bucky was a mainstay on the show then his status would be relevant. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the case.  Wait another thought: sometimes in TV shows especially comedies they have recurring animals. Maybe the dog from Little Rascals is still alive because it's an animal actor. However animal actors don't always live as long as we'd think and their lifespan depends on their breed and care.  But I'm not certain about the specific dog's name or its current status. To be thorough I should consider that if the dog was a prominent character there might have been reports about its health or passing. Alternatively maybe the dog is still alive because it wasn't in the show for too long.  Wait another angle: sometimes the actors (including animal actors) from shows pass away and their deaths are reported. If I recall correctly some of the dogs from Little Rascals have passed away but I'm not sure if this particular one is still alive.  I think I need to make a judgment here based on what I remember. Since the show ended in 2005 and assuming the dog was part of it during its run it's possible that the dog has lived beyond that time. However without specific information it's hard to say definitively.  But wait maybe the dog is still alive because it wasn't a very old animal when the show ended. Alternatively if the dog was used in other projects after Little Rascals that might indicate it's still around.  Alternatively perhaps the dog passed away a few years back and there were reports about it. I'm not certain but given that I don't have specific knowledge I'll have to make an educated guess based on general assumptions. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,41.69922189999488,0.014229915064521816,0.004178196059250277,0.0,0.0,0.0
12,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Salt Lake City is the biggest city in Utah. Let me start by recalling what I know about Utah's cities. I remember that Salt Lake City is the capital of Utah which often means it's also the largest city in the state. But wait sometimes capitals aren't always the biggest cities because other factors like neighboring areas or growth can influence population.  I think about other major cities in Utah besides Salt Lake City. There's Provo which I believe is a significant city near Salt Lake City. Then there's Ogden and maybe even cities like West Valley City. I'm not entirely sure about their populations but I have a feeling that Salt Lake City still holds the title as the most populous.  I should consider the population data. From what I remember the latest estimates or censuses might show Salt Lake City having around 200 000 people while cities like West Valley could be close behind maybe in the 100 000s. But even so Salt Lake City's population is larger than these others.  Also considering the urban area or metro area can sometimes make a difference. The Salt Lake City metropolitan area includes several surrounding cities and towns making it a large urban sprawl. However when talking about the biggest city within Utah it's usually referring to the city proper rather than the entire metro area.  I think I've heard that Salt Lake City is indeed the largest in terms of population so putting it all together my conclusion is that yes Salt Lake City is the biggest city in Utah. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,44.99758949998068,0.015406587248130323,0.004523691240232771,0.0,0.0,0.0
16,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the days get longer and shorter at the equator. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about day length variations.  I remember that places near the poles experience significant changes in daylight throughout the year. For example during the summer they have almost 24-hour daylight and in winter it's the opposite. But what about the equator?  The equator is at 0 degrees latitude. I think the days and nights are more consistent there compared to other latitudes. Wait isn't that because the sun's rays hit the equator directly? So throughout the year the amount of daylight should be roughly the same.  I also recall something about the solstices affecting day length. During the summer solstice the Northern Hemisphere gets more sunlight and the Southern Hemisphere gets less. But at the equator since it's exactly between the poles the effect might average out. So each day should have about 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness all year round.  Wait but does that mean the days don't get longer or shorter? Yes because if they're always around 12 hours there's no variation in length. So at the equator the days don't change much in terms of length—they stay about the same throughout the year. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,46.469261199992616,0.01592511177995976,0.0046759407192838364,0.0,0.0,0.0
5,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Glenn died in The Walking Dead season 6. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show and specifically about Glenn's storyline.  Glenn was a main character portrayed by Steven Yeun. He first appeared in Season 1 as a delivery man who helps Rick's group after the apocalypse begins. Throughout the series he becomes one of the core members of the group known for his resourcefulness and loyalty.  I remember that in earlier seasons Glenn went through various challenges including being captured by the Governor in Season 4 which was a tough arc for him. After that he continued to be an important part of the story until... hmm when did he die?  Wait I think he died in Season 6. Let me try to remember specific episodes or key moments. There's an episode where Glenn is involved in a fight with some zombies or maybe another group of survivors. Oh right there was an incident involving a horde of walkers.  I believe the final moments for Glenn were in ""The Last of His Kind "" which is Episode 9 of Season 6. In that episode he's trying to protect the group and ends up getting surrounded by walkers. He uses a blowtorch as a weapon but eventually gets overwhelmed. The scene was pretty intense and emotional.  So putting it all together yes Glenn dies in Season 6. His death is significant because it affects the other characters especially Maggie who was pregnant with their child at the time. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,50.4364162000129,0.01730986077676375,0.005082531536956552,0.0,0.0,0.0
15,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Netherlands is part of the United Kingdom. Hmm let's start by breaking down what each country is.  The Netherlands is a country in Western Europe known for places like Amsterdam and Rotterdam. It's also sometimes referred to as Holland though technically only parts of it are called that. The UK or the United Kingdom includes England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland. I remember that these are four separate countries within one union.  I think the Netherlands is a sovereign state on its own right? So it's not part of another country unless specified by some international agreement or something. But from what I know the UK and the Netherlands have had historical connections like trade and colonial ties but they're separate nations.  Wait maybe there are dependencies or territories that overlap? No I don't think so. The Netherlands has its own government language culture and history distinct from the UK. They might collaborate on some issues through the EU but that doesn't mean one is part of the other.  So putting it all together the Netherlands isn't a constituent part of the United Kingdom. They're separate sovereign states. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,50.71543620000011,0.017423518560535898,0.005115903802504636,0.0,0.0,0.0
17,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the statement ""was she like the wind in dirty dancing"" is true or false. First I should understand what each part of this question means.  The phrase ""like the wind"" probably refers to someone being as free-spirited or untamed as the wind. In the context of ""Dirty Dancing "" which is a movie I remember that the main character was named Baby and she had a dance partner who taught her how to dance. The term ""wind"" might be metaphorically referring to someone wild or unpredictable.  I think the question is asking if the female lead in ""Dirty Dancing"" (Baby) was like the wind meaning she was free-spirited or untamed. From what I recall about the movie Baby was more of a sweet and innocent character who was learning to dance but wasn't necessarily portrayed as wild. The male lead Johnny was the one who was more of a bad boy or had that wild untamed energy.  So putting it together if ""she"" refers to Baby then saying she was like the wind might not be accurate because her character was more about transformation from innocent to confident rather than being wild. Therefore the statement would be false. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,55.26900519998162,0.019015033520366882,0.005583205364267481,0.0,0.0,0.0
18,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Johnson & Wales is a for-profit school. Hmm I'm not entirely sure about this but let me think through it step by step.  First I know that Johnson & Wales University (JWU) is an institution I've heard of before probably in the context of culinary arts or hospitality because they have a reputation in those fields. But whether it's for-profit or not-for-profit isn't something I'm certain about.  I remember that there are two main types of higher education institutions: non-profit and for-profit. Non-profits usually include public universities which are funded by the government and private non-profit colleges often with a mission tied to a specific cause or religious affiliation. For-profit schools on the other hand are typically run as businesses aiming to make a profit.  I think JWU is a private institution because I don't recall it being part of any state system. But is it for-profit? I'm not sure. Maybe I can think about how they market themselves or their programs. For-profit schools often have more aggressive marketing and might offer online degrees or career-oriented programs which JWU does.  Wait but I also remember that some private non-profits are quite expensive too. So just because a school is expensive doesn't necessarily mean it's for-profit. Another angle: ownership. If the university is owned by shareholders looking to make profits then it's for-profit. Otherwise if it's run as a non-profit organization with any surplus going back into the institution or community it's not.  I think JWU was founded in 1914 and has campuses in Rhode Island Florida North Carolina and online programs. They focus on career-oriented fields like business culinary arts hospitality and tourism. These are areas where for-profit schools often operate because they can be lucrative.  But I'm not entirely certain about their status. Maybe I should consider if they're accredited by a non-profit accrediting body or if they have any ties to larger corporate entities. For-profits sometimes have controversial reputations regarding student outcomes and high tuition fees so that's another clue.  Wait I think I've heard that Johnson & Wales is actually a private non-profit university. They might receive some funding from donations or endowments rather than being profit-driven. Their focus on specific career fields could be more about meeting market demands rather than maximizing profits.  So putting it all together: JWU is likely a non-profit because they're an established institution with a long history not primarily focused on making money but on education and their specific programs. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,59.91969129999052,0.020640469216876393,0.006060466752752724,0.0,0.0,0.0
19,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Hope was married to Wyatt on ""Bold and Beautiful."" Hmm I'm not super familiar with all the details of the show but I know it's a soap opera that's been around for a long time. Let me think about what I remember.  First I recall that Hope is one of the main characters played by Ann-Margaret. She's had several relationships over the years. Wyatt is another character and if I'm not mistaken he's been involved with multiple women as well. I think there was a time when they were together but I'm not sure about marriage.  I remember that in soap operas characters often get married and divorced frequently because of the nature of the storytelling. So it's possible that Hope and Wyatt got married at some point. But I also recall that Hope has been involved with other men like Bill who is another significant character. Maybe she was married to both Bill and Wyatt at different times?  Wait wasn't there a storyline where Hope had multiple marriages? I think she might have been married to both Bill and Wyatt but perhaps not simultaneously. So maybe they were married at some point but I'm not entirely certain about the exact details.  I should also consider that ""Bold and Beautiful"" has had many years of storylines so characters' relationships can change a lot over time. It's possible that Hope was married to Wyatt in one of the earlier seasons or in a specific arc. But I don't remember seeing them get married together; maybe it was more of an on-again off-again relationship without marriage.  Alternatively perhaps they were engaged but never actually married. Or maybe there was a fake marriage for plot purposes. I'm not sure about that either.  I think the safest bet is to say that yes Hope and Wyatt were married at some point because in soap operas such dramatic events are common. But I'm not 100% certain without checking specific episode details or official sources. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,62.913621000014246,0.02168989287314401,0.006368599146039692,0.0,0.0,0.0

She's the Deputy Director of the Parks Department in Pawnee Indiana. The show has several seasons and I think there was an episode where she ran for city council.  Wait let me recall. In one of the later seasons maybe season 5 or 6 Leslie decided to run against another candidate named Chris Traeger. Chris is also a character from the show the Health Department director who has some political ambitions. I think they had a debate where Leslie was up against him.  Leslie is known for her enthusiasm and dedication to Pawnee but sometimes she can be a bit naive or overconfident. On the other hand Chris is more calculating and manipulative. But does that mean he would win? Or does Leslie's charm and connection with the community help her?  I think in the end Leslie did win the election. She had support from many people in Pawnee including her friends like Ron Swanson and Ann Perkins. There was a scene where she gave a heartfelt speech about wanting to make Pawnee the best it can be which probably swayed some voters.  But wait I'm not entirely sure. Did Chris do anything underhanded? Maybe he tried to spread rumors or use his position in the Health Department against her. However Leslie's positive campaign and genuine care for the town likely played a bigger role.  So putting it all together I believe Leslie Knope did win the City Council election because of her strong community ties and positive campaigning. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,66.11676510001416,0.02280900189288544,0.006697192596875739,0.0,0.0,0.0
13,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's a Season 2 of ""Case Histories."" Hmm I'm not super familiar with this show but I think it's related to true crime or something like that. Let me try to recall any information I might have.  First I remember hearing about ""The Case Histories"" being a podcast before it became a TV series. The podcast was hosted by Sarah Koenig and was quite popular for its in-depth storytelling. Then there was a TV adaptation called ""Case Histories "" which I believe was on HBO or another platform.   I think the first season came out a few years ago maybe around 2019 or 2020. Now as of my knowledge cutoff in July 2024 I don't recall hearing about a second season being released. Sometimes shows get renewed quickly if they're successful but other times it takes time or doesn't happen at all.  I should check some sources to confirm. Maybe looking up recent news or announcements from HBO or the production company. If there's been any talk about Season 2 it would likely be in recent articles or official statements. Alternatively I can think about similar shows and their renewal patterns. Many true crime series have multiple seasons but sometimes they don't if the content doesn't warrant it or if the creators move on.  Wait another thought: sometimes a show might not explicitly announce a second season because it's still in development but that's less common these days with streaming services pushing for more content. If I can't find any information about Season 2 being in production or released then it's probably safe to assume there isn't one yet.  So putting this together: the podcast had multiple seasons but when it was adapted into a TV series only one season was released. Therefore as of now there is no Season 2 available. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,70.05762449998292,0.02418889396436809,0.007102357321269212,0.0,0.0,0.0
14,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" was written specifically for Top Gun. Hmm I remember that song being iconic from the movie but I'm not sure if it was created just for that film or if it existed before.  I think the song is by some band... maybe Kenny Loggins? Yeah I believe he did ""Highway to the Danger Zone."" But wait was that his original song or was it written for Top Gun specifically? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the movie's producers commissioned him to write it but I don't recall hearing it before the movie came out.  Wait Kenny Loggins is known for other songs too like ""Footloose."" That one was in another movie right? So maybe he writes songs that are used in movies but sometimes they're not written exclusively for them. But with ""Highway to the Danger Zone "" I feel like it might have been created specifically for Top Gun because it's so tied to the scenes and the vibe of the movie.  I should check if there's any information about whether the song was written before or after the movie. If it was written after then yes it was made for Top Gun. But if it existed before then no. I think it was created for the movie because it perfectly matches the action and tone of the film. Plus I don't remember hearing it anywhere else before the movie's release.  So putting it all together I believe ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" was indeed written specifically for Top Gun. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,72.08869599999161,0.024903435622962378,0.007312161464763525,0.0,0.0,0.0
20,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Melaleuca and Tea Tree are the same thing. Let me start by recalling what I know about these plants.  I remember that both names are often associated with essential oils used for their health benefits. The Tea Tree oil is something I've heard of before; it's commonly used in skincare products because of its antimicrobial properties. But where does Melaleuca come into play?  Wait isn't Melaleuca another name for the same plant? I think so. Let me try to remember the scientific names. The Tea Tree as far as I can recall is scientifically known as Melaleuca alternifolia. So that would mean that Melaleuca is the genus and alternifolia is the species.  So if someone refers to Melaleuca they're probably talking about the plant from which Tea Tree oil is extracted. That makes sense because I've seen products labeled both as Tea Tree Oil and Melaleuca Oil. They must be referring to the same thing since the scientific name aligns them.  But wait could there be other species under the Melaleuca genus that aren't used for tea tree oil? Maybe but when it comes to essential oils especially the ones known for their medicinal properties it's specifically M. alternifolia. So in common usage when people talk about Tea Tree Oil they're almost certainly talking about Melaleuca alternifolia.  I should also consider if there are any differences in how they're used or their properties. From what I know both terms refer to the same oil with similar benefits. There's no significant difference in their applications or effects because they come from the same plant.  So putting it all together Melaleuca and Tea Tree are indeed the same thing when referring to the essential oil extracted from Melaleuca alternifolia. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,63.053708699997514,0.022010456793748835,0.006462723313593456,0.0,0.0,0.0
21,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether there will be new episodes of Black Mirror. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. Black Mirror is a British science fiction anthology series created by Charlie Brooker. It's known for exploring themes related to modern society particularly the unintended consequences of new technologies. Each season typically consists of standalone episodes that delve into different futuristic scenarios.  I remember hearing that after its initial seasons there was talk about it becoming a movie or maybe ending but then they released more seasons. The latest I know is that there have been several seasons with the last one being Season 6 which came out in December 2021. Since then I haven't heard any official announcements from Netflix (the streaming service that produces it) about new episodes.  However considering how popular Black Mirror has been and given that Charlie Brooker is known for his thought-provoking storytelling there's always a possibility of more content. Sometimes shows take breaks between seasons especially if they're event-driven or each season is standalone. But without an official statement from the creators or Netflix it's hard to say for sure.  I should also think about the structure of Black Mirror. Since each episode is self-contained there isn't a traditional narrative arc that would require continuation. This makes it possible for new episodes to be produced without needing to follow up on previous plots. But again this doesn't necessarily mean they will produce more; it's just a structural consideration.  Another angle is the creative team and Charlie Brooker's involvement. If he's still active in creating content there might be potential for new episodes. However if he has moved on to other projects that could affect whether Black Mirror continues.  I should also consider the business side. Netflix invests in shows based on their popularity and viewership. If Black Mirror remains a hit they're more likely to greenlight another season. But without recent data on its current performance it's hard to gauge this.  In summary while there's no concrete information indicating new episodes are on the way the show's structure allows for potential future seasons. However without an official announcement I can't be certain. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,63.65222180003184,0.022232532578421407,0.00652792933655049,0.0,0.0,0.0
22,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if you can get a rash from using a hot tub. Hmm let's think about this. Hot tubs are usually warm and people use them for relaxation. But sometimes when things aren't clean problems can happen.  I remember hearing that hot tubs require maintenance like adding chemicals to keep the water clean. If they don't maintain it properly bacteria or other germs might grow. One germ I've heard about is Legionella which causes Legionnaires' disease. That's a lung infection but maybe there are skin issues too.  Also some people have sensitive skin. The chemicals used in hot tubs like chlorine or bromine can irritate the skin if they're not balanced correctly. If someone is allergic or their skin reacts badly that could cause a rash.  Another thing is the temperature. Hot tubs are supposed to be hot but too much heat might dry out the skin and lead to irritation. Maybe that's another way a rash could happen.  I've also heard about something called ""hot tub folliculitis "" which sounds like it's related to hair follicles getting infected. That would definitely cause a rash or bumps on the skin.  So putting this together yes there are several ways using a hot tub could lead to a rash: improper chemical levels irritating the skin bacterial infections from unclean water and even the heat affecting sensitive skin. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,61.19939069999964,0.021371534732283183,0.006275122640836134,0.0,0.0,0.0
23,"<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether it's possible for twins to have two different fathers. Hmm twins usually share the same mother right? But what about their fathers? I know that sometimes people talk about half-siblings who share one parent but not both. So could twins be like that?  Wait twins are typically either identical or fraternal. Identical twins come from the same sperm and egg so they'd have the same father. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs fertilized by two different sperm but those would still be from the same mother. But can they have different fathers? That seems tricky because both twins share the same mother.  I remember hearing about something called "" superfecundation "" which is when a woman releases multiple eggs and each gets fertilized by different men's sperm. So if that happens could it result in twins with different fathers? I think that's possible but I'm not entirely sure how common or accepted that is.  Also there are cases where artificial insemination might be involved maybe using donor sperm for one twin and the partner's sperm for another. But would those twins still count as biological siblings?  I guess legally and biologically if they share the same mother but different fathers they could be considered half-siblings rather than twins. So in that case it's more like two separate pregnancies resulting from different fathers around the same time.  But I'm not 100% certain about all the details here. Maybe there are other factors or exceptions I haven't thought of. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,63.31138870000723,0.022110447234109282,0.006492082565703002,0.0,0.0,0.0
24,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Thousand Island Dressing is the same as French Dressing. Let me start by recalling what each of these dressings typically consists of.  Thousand Island Dressing from what I remember is a creamy salad dressing that's usually made with mayonnaise sometimes mixed with other ingredients like relish or ketchup. It gets its name because it's supposed to have flecks of green herbs or spices that look like tiny islands in the cream. So it's pretty rich and has a distinct flavor.  On the other hand French Dressing is something I associate more with vinaigrette-type dressings. From what I know French Dressing usually includes oil vinegar (like red wine vinegar) garlic herbs maybe some Dijon mustard and perhaps a bit of sugar or honey for balance. It's typically tangy and not as creamy as Thousand Island.  I think the key differences here are in their ingredients and texture. Thousand Island is creamy and may have a slightly sweet or tangy flavor depending on the mix while French Dressing is more acidic and savory. They're used differently too; Thousand Island might be paired with salads that could use creaminess like potato salad or coleslaw whereas French Dressing goes well with crisp greens because of its lighter texture.  I don't recall any overlap in their primary ingredients beyond maybe some herbs or a bit of vinegar for acidity but the base structures are quite different. Thousand Island relies heavily on mayo and sometimes dairy making it thicker while French Dressing is oil-based and thinner.  So putting this together they're not the same because their ingredients textures flavors and typical uses all differ significantly. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,60.650997100019595,0.021183927371339357,0.00622003725679641,0.0,0.0,0.0
25,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if liquid nitrogen and dry ice are the same thing. Let me start by recalling what each of these terms means.  Liquid nitrogen is something I've heard about before. It's used for freezing things quickly right? Like in labs or maybe even at home for some experiments. I think it's a液态 form of nitrogen gas. Nitrogen is a common element making up a large part of the Earth's atmosphere. So when you cool nitrogen gas down to its liquid state that's liquid nitrogen.  Now dry ice. That term sounds familiar too. I remember hearing that dry ice isn't really ice at all but something else. Maybe it's solid carbon dioxide? Because regular ice is frozen water so if it's called ""dry "" maybe it doesn't melt into a liquid but sublimates directly from solid to gas. So when you have dry ice it's solid CO2.  Wait so both are substances in their condensed forms—liquid nitrogen and solid carbon dioxide. They're both used for cooling purposes but they come from different gases. Nitrogen is N2 and carbon dioxide is CO2. That means they're not the same substance because one is a liquid form of nitrogen and the other is a solid form of carbon dioxide.  I should also think about their physical states. Liquid nitrogen is a liquid at very low temperatures while dry ice remains a solid under standard atmospheric pressure but sublimates into gas when exposed to higher temps or lower pressures. So they have different properties beyond just being cold.  Another point: the chemical composition. Nitrogen is N2 and carbon dioxide is CO2. They're entirely different molecules so there's no way they can be the same substance. Even in their condensed forms liquid nitrogen and dry ice are distinct because of their molecular makeup.  I don't think I'm missing anything here. Both terms refer to different substances used for cooling but made from different gases. So no they're not the same. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,63.97613540000748,0.022349884967882174,0.006562386414401297,0.0,0.0,0.0
26,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Fred from First Dates has a partner. Hmm I'm not super familiar with the show but I think Fred is one of the regulars on the UK TV show ""First Dates."" He's known for his humor and often plays the role of the funny slightly awkward date.   I remember that in reality TV shows like this sometimes the participants are portrayed as single to make their stories more relatable or dramatic. But I'm not sure if Fred is actually single in real life or if he's just acting that way for the show.  Maybe I should think about any interviews or statements Fred has made where he talks about his personal life. If he's been open about having a partner then the answer would be True. On the other hand if there's no public information indicating he's in a relationship it might be False.  I also wonder if the show's producers keep some details private to maintain the show's dynamics. Sometimes keeping certain aspects of their personal lives under wraps can add to the entertainment value or avoid conflicts of interest.  Another angle is to consider if Fred has been seen publicly with someone or mentioned a partner in any context outside the show. If there are photos or interviews where he talks about his partner that would support a True answer. But if there's no such information available it might lean towards False.  I should also think about how long Fred has been on the show and whether his status as single is part of his character for the节目. Sometimes characters on reality TV have traits that are exaggerated or created for the sake of the show not reflecting their real lives.  In summary without concrete evidence from interviews or public appearances where Fred mentions a partner it's hard to say definitively. But given that he's been a prominent figure on ""First Dates"" and hasn't openly discussed being in a relationship I might lean towards him not having a partner as widely known. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,62.79911009999341,0.021939285866150803,0.006441826063829493,0.0,0.0,0.0
27,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Scar is alive in The Lion King 2. Hmm let me think about this. First I remember that Scar was a major character in The Lion King right? He was Mufasa's brother and tried to take over the Pride Lands. In the first movie he gets defeated by Simba and there's that scene where he falls into a volcano or something so I always thought he died then.  But wait The Lion King 2 is actually called The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. It's a sequel set later on. So does Scar appear in this movie? From what I recall Scar doesn't show up in the second movie. Instead the story focuses on Simba and his daughter Kiara dealing with issues like the hyenas causing problems.  I think Scar's death was confirmed in The Lion King itself so it wouldn't make sense for him to be alive in the sequel. Plus the plot of the second movie doesn't involve Scar anymore; it's more about internal Pride Lands conflicts rather than external threats from Scar.  So putting this together Scar isn't alive in The Lion King 2 because he died at the end of the first movie and wasn't part of the story in the sequel. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,58.41486680001253,0.02040131369895636,0.005990245768439701,0.0,0.0,0.0
28,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether breakfast lunch and dinner are always served in Italy. Hmm let's break this down.  First I know that in many countries including Italy people typically have three main meals a day: breakfast lunch and dinner. But the question is asking if they're ""always"" served there. That means I need to consider if there are any situations where one of these meals isn't served or if the timing varies significantly.  I remember that Italian mealtimes can be different from other countries. For example lunch in Italy is usually around 1 PM to 3 PM and dinner is later sometimes as late as 8 PM or even 9 PM. But does this mean that all three meals are always present?  Well breakfast in Italy isn't as heavy as in some other places. They often have a lighter meal in the morning maybe just coffee and something small like bread or pastries. So breakfast is usually served but it's not as elaborate.  Lunch is traditionally the main meal of the day in Italy. It's when families gather to eat together. So I think lunch is almost always served especially on weekdays. However on weekends or special occasions people might have different eating patterns but I'm not sure if that means they skip lunch entirely.  Dinner as I mentioned earlier tends to be later in the evening. But does everyone in Italy eat dinner every day? Probably not always. Some days especially when people are busy or have social engagements they might skip dinner or have a lighter meal.  Also considering different regions in Italy some areas might have different customs regarding mealtimes. For example in southern Italy the meals might be structured differently compared to the north. But I'm not sure if that affects whether all three meals are always served.  Another angle is to think about working hours and lifestyle. In Italy many people take a break for lunch which suggests that lunch is a regular part of their day. However dinner might sometimes be skipped depending on individual schedules or preferences.  I should also consider特殊情况 like holidays or festivals where eating patterns change but the question is about general practice not specific events.  So putting it all together: breakfast is usually served albeit lightly; lunch is almost always a main meal; dinner is typically served but might be skipped occasionally. Therefore while two of the three meals are consistently present dinner isn't necessarily always served every day by everyone. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,67.9735529999889,0.02375025405311293,0.006973563611656315,0.0,0.0,0.0
29,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether cowpeas and black-eyed peas are the same thing. Let me start by recalling what each of these is.  Cowpeas—I think they're a type of legume right? They have those distinctive round seeds maybe with some markings. I've heard them referred to as ""Southern peas"" sometimes because they're commonly used in Southern U.S. cuisine. They come in different colors like black brown or white.  Black-eyed peas on the other hand are a specific variety of cowpeas. The term ""black-eyed"" refers to the distinctive dark spot on each seed. So when I think about it black-eyed peas are just one type within the broader category of cowpeas. They're used in dishes like Hoppin' John and are popular in Southern cooking.  Wait but could there be confusion? Maybe some people use ""cowpea"" as a general term for any kind of cowpea including black-eyed ones. But I think they're technically the same plant species Vigna unguiculata. The difference is just in their variety or subspecies.  So are they the same thing? Well if we're talking about the plant yes they belong to the same species. However when it comes to culinary terms black-eyed peas are a specific type of cowpea. So depending on context they might be considered the same in some cases but different in others.  I think the answer is that they are not exactly the same because black-eyed peas are a subset of cowpeas specifically the variety with the distinct black spot. But sometimes people use ""cowpea"" to refer to any type including black-eyed ones. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,60.92652909999015,0.02130091106701043,0.006254386078559096,0.0,0.0,0.0
30,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether alligators drown their prey and then eat them later. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about alligators. They're reptiles right? And they live in water environments like swamps and rivers. I remember that alligators are predators so they hunt other animals.  Now the question is specifically about whether they drown their prey and then eat it later. From what I've heard before some large predators cache their food to save it for later. For example I think bears sometimes do this with fish or honey. But does that apply to alligators?  I should consider how alligators hunt. They have a strong bite force and can take down prey much larger than themselves. When they catch something maybe they kill it immediately by biting but do they then drag it underwater to drown it? Or do they just eat it right there?  Wait I remember reading that some crocodilians which include alligators do cache their food. They might carry it to a safer place or even submerge it so other predators don't take it. But does this mean they actually drown the prey first?  I'm not entirely sure if drowning is part of the process. Maybe they just hold onto the prey underwater until it's dead but that's different from actively drowning it. Or perhaps they kill it with their bite and then store it for later.  Another thought: alligators might not need to drown their prey because once they've bitten them the prey doesn't survive long anyway. So maybe the act of submerging is more about storage than causing death by drowning.  I should also think about whether there's any evidence or specific behavior observed where alligators are seen drowning prey and then coming back later to eat it. If I recall correctly some studies show that they do cache food but I'm not sure if the caching involves submerging live prey until it drowns.  Wait maybe the confusion comes from how other animals handle their food. For example otters might drown prey and then eat it later. But alligators are different; their method of predation is more about a powerful bite to kill instantly rather than prolonged drowning.  So putting this together: Alligators likely don't drown their prey in the sense of submerging them alive for an extended period. Instead they probably kill them with their bite and then either eat them immediately or cache them underwater for later consumption without necessarily causing drowning as a method. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,65.30541849997826,0.022822324939397755,0.006701104517655488,0.0,0.0,0.0
31,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Isle of Man is part of the European Economic Area (EEA). Let me start by recalling what the EEA is. The EEA is a single market that includes all EU member states plus some other countries that have agreements with the EU to ensure free movement of goods services capital and labor. It's designed to maintain the internal market without being part of the EU itself.  Now the Isle of Man is a British Crown dependency located in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. I know that it's not part of the United Kingdom but has a special relationship with it. Since Brexit the UK has left the EEA so any dependencies would likely follow suit unless there are specific arrangements.  I should check if the Isle of Man signed its own agreement with the EU post-Brexit. The European Union and the UK have a trade and cooperation agreement but I'm not sure if that extends to the Crown dependencies like the Isle of Man Jersey and Guernsey. These entities often have separate agreements.  Looking into it I remember reading that after Brexit the Isle of Man does not automatically remain part of the EEA. Instead they would need their own agreement with the EU. However as far as I know the Isle of Man has a separate trade agreement but isn't part of the EEA. This means they don't have full access to the single market unless through specific arrangements.  Therefore considering all this the Isle of Man is not part of the European Economic Area. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,65.1830683000153,0.022785712627511844,0.006690354389032222,0.0,0.0,0.0
32,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether King Louie died in The Jungle Book from 2016. First I should recall what I know about the movie. The Jungle Book is a Disney film that's based on Rudyard Kipling's book but it's also inspired by previous adaptations especially the 1967 animated version.  In the 2016 live-action adaptation directed by Jon Favreau King Louie is a character who is a king of the apes. He plays a significant role in Mowgli's journey as he tries to convince him to join the jungle community and later helps him understand his place.  I remember that in the original story King Louie doesn't die; he's more of an antagonistic figure but not necessarily evil. However in the 2016 movie I think there was a scene where he confronts Mowgli and maybe other characters. But does he die?  Wait no I don't recall any scenes where King Louie dies. He seems to have a change of heart or at least helps Mowgli in some way without meeting a fatal end. The main conflict in the movie is more about Shere Khan the tiger who is the antagonist and does die.  So putting it together I don't think King Louie dies in the 2016 version. He's part of the jungle community but doesn't meet a violent end like some other characters. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,61.7429284999962,0.021576526308935223,0.006335312388551669,0.0,0.0,0.0
33,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Dwyane Wade made the playoffs during his rookie year. Let me start by recalling what I know about him. He was a really good basketball player part of the Miami Heat's championship team with LeBron James and Chris Bosh. But when did he start playing?  I think he came into the NBA around 2003 or 2004. His rookie year would be his first season in the league. I remember that making the playoffs isn't always guaranteed especially for a new player on a team that might not be very strong.  Wait the Miami Heat during Dwyane Wade's time... I think they were rebuilding when he was drafted. He was picked by the Heat in 2003 right? So his rookie year would have been the 2003-2004 season. Did that team make the playoffs?  I'm trying to remember if the Heat made it far in the playoffs that year. I think they did make the playoffs because he was a key player but maybe they didn't go too far. Or perhaps they didn't even make it past the first round.  Wait no actually I think the Heat were pretty good that season. They had Wade and Shaquille O'Neal who joined them later. But wait wasn't Shaq joining them after Wade's rookie year? So in his first season he was with the Heat but without Shaq yet.  I'm a bit confused now. Let me think about the 2003-2004 Miami Heat team. They had Dwyane Wade as their star and they were known for their fast-paced style of play. I believe that team did make the playoffs because they finished with a decent record. But how far did they get?  I recall that in his rookie year Wade was already making an impact. He might have been named to the All-Star team which would indicate he was performing well enough for the team to be competitive.  Wait but I'm not entirely sure if they made it past the first round. Maybe they lost in the first round of the playoffs that season. So yes they did make the playoffs but didn't advance very far.  So putting it all together Dwyane Wade's rookie year was 2003-2004 and I think the Miami Heat did make the playoffs that year. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,69.7568146000267,0.024390776555621614,0.007161634206857218,0.0,0.0,0.0
34,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the dorsal root ganglion carries sensory input. Let me start by recalling what I know about the nervous system.  The nervous system is divided into two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) which includes the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) which connects the CNS to the rest of the body. The PNS is further divided into the somatic nervous system which controls voluntary movements and the autonomic nervous system which handles involuntary functions.  Now focusing on sensory input I remember that sensory information comes from receptors in the skin muscles joints etc. and travels towards the CNS. This pathway involves different types of nerves. There are two main categories: afferent (sensory) neurons and efferent (motor) neurons.  Afferent neurons carry signals from the periphery to the CNS. These neurons have their cell bodies in various locations depending on where they originate. For example some sensory neurons have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia.  Wait what exactly are the dorsal root ganglia? They're clusters of nerve cells (ganglia) located along the posterior (dorsal) roots of the spinal nerves. These ganglia contain the cell bodies of sensory neurons. So when a stimulus is detected by a sensory receptor like a touch or pain it sends signals through these neurons to the dorsal root ganglion.  From there the axons of these neurons enter the spinal cord and relay the information up to the brain via the thalamus. This makes sense because without the dorsal root ganglia the sensory signals wouldn't be transmitted properly.  So putting this together: The process starts with a sensory receptor detecting something sending signals along the sensory neuron towards the spinal cord. The cell body of that neuron is in the dorsal root ganglion. Once the signal reaches the ganglion it continues into the spinal cord and then to the brain for processing.  Therefore the dorsal root ganglion plays a crucial role in carrying sensory input by serving as the location where the cell bodies of these sensory neurons are located. Without them the signals wouldn't be transmitted correctly from the periphery to the CNS.  I don't think I'm missing any key points here. The main idea is that the dorsal root ganglia are essential for transmitting sensory information into the central nervous system. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,65.53548359998967,0.022911583406068393,0.00672731264131659,0.0,0.0,0.0
35,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if finding a four-leaf clover is considered lucky. Hmm I remember hearing that four-leaf clovers are often associated with good luck. But why exactly? Let me think about where I've seen this before.  I think it's from stories or maybe even some cultural references. Like people sometimes carry them as charms or keep them as tokens of good fortune. There's also the saying ""the luck of the Irish "" and I believe that's connected to clovers too especially the four-leaf variety.  Wait why is a four-leaf clover lucky in the first place? Maybe it's because they're rare compared to three-leaf clovers. So finding one stands out which makes people feel special or fortunate. Also in folklore each leaf might represent something—like faith hope love and luck.  I should also consider if there are any negative connotations. I don't recall any; it's mostly positive stuff. Maybe some people think they bring good luck so the belief is widespread enough that it's considered true.  So putting it all together yes finding a four-leaf clover is generally seen as lucky because of its cultural significance and rarity. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,62.56035739998333,0.02187637008473576,0.006423352694959684,0.0,0.0,0.0
36,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether England has ever won the Women's World Cup. Let me start by recalling what I know about the FIFA Women's World Cup. It's a tournament that takes place every four years and is the most prestigious event in women's soccer.  I remember that the United States has been very successful winning multiple times. But what about England? I think they've had some good teams over the years. Let me try to recall any specific instances where England might have won.  Wait wasn't there a World Cup in 1966 when England hosted and won the men's tournament? That was their only win so far as I know. But that's for the men's team not the women's.  For the women's side I'm trying to remember if they've ever reached the final or won it. I think in recent years like maybe 2019 England had a strong team with players like Lionesses which is their nickname. But did they win that year?  I believe the 2019 Women's World Cup was hosted by France and the US ended up winning again. So England probably didn't win that tournament. Before that I think the last time England might have been in a final could be earlier maybe in the 90s or early 2000s.  Wait wasn't there a World Cup in 1995? I'm not sure if England was involved then. Maybe they didn't participate much back then. Or perhaps they came close but didn't win.  I also recall that Norway won the Women's World Cup in 1995 and again in 2007 or was it another year? No wait I think Norway won in 1995 and Germany has had some success too. England might have been runners-up at some point but not champions.  So putting this together I don't think England has ever won the Women's World Cup. They've had strong teams especially recently with their performance in 2019 but they haven't come out on top yet. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,68.6065646999923,0.02398758378711953,0.007043248508219162,0.0,0.0,0.0
37,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the Mafia is still active in New Jersey. Hmm I know that the Mafia has a history in places like New York and New Jersey especially with organized crime. But does it still exist there today?  I remember hearing about the Five Families of New York which includes some from New Jersey as well. Maybe they're still involved in activities there. There have been news reports about arrests related to organized crime so that suggests ongoing activity.  Also I think the Mafia isn't just a historical thing; it's an international network with branches in many places. So it makes sense that they'd still be active in regions where they've had a presence before.  I should consider if law enforcement efforts have reduced their influence significantly. Maybe there are fewer high-profile cases now but that doesn't mean the groups have completely disbanded. They might operate more discreetly or focus on different types of crimes.  In summary based on historical presence continued law enforcement actions and the nature of organized crime networks it seems likely that the Mafia is still active in New Jersey. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,62.835054100025445,0.021980896594582595,0.006454043830468854,0.0,0.0,0.0

It's a 2016 South Korean drama directed by Yoon Jeong-woo. From what I remember it's about a man who starts an affair with his wife's younger sister leading to some complicated family dynamics and emotional conflicts.  I think the movie is fictional because I don't recall any major news events or real-life cases that it's based on. Sometimes movies are inspired by true stories but in this case I don't have any information suggesting that ""Love Child"" is改编自真实事件。Instead it seems to be a story created for the screen to explore themes of love betrayal and family.  I should also consider if there were any interviews or behind-the-scenes information where the director mentioned it being based on real events. If I can't find any such references it's likely fictional. Additionally looking at similar movies many are fictional dramas that delve into personal relationships without being tied to true stories.  So putting this together ""Love Child"" doesn't appear to be based on a true story but is an original work exploring complex emotional situations. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,63.16519010002958,0.022093142025155044,0.00648700140003692,0.0,0.0,0.0
39,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if thread seal tape is the same as Teflon tape. Hmm let me think about what each of these products does.  Thread seal tape is something I've heard mechanics use when they're dealing with pipes or threaded connections. It's used to create a seal between two threads to prevent leaks. So it's applied around the threads before tightening them. The purpose is to make sure that whatever is inside the pipe doesn't leak out especially under pressure.  On the other hand Teflon tape is a product I'm more familiar with from everyday use. It's often used in cooking because it's non-stick and can withstand high temperatures. But wait isn't there also a type of Teflon tape used for plumbing? I think so. That's probably what people are referring to when they talk about using Teflon tape on pipes.  So thread seal tape is specifically designed for sealing threaded connections in plumbing or other mechanical systems. It needs to be durable and able to handle pressure without breaking down. Teflon tape while it can also be used for sealing might not have the same properties as thread seal tape. I remember hearing that thread seal tape is sometimes called PTFE (which stands for polytetrafluoroethylene) tape which is the same material as Teflon.  Wait a minute so both are made from PTFE? That would mean they're essentially the same material but maybe used differently. Thread seal tape might be more specialized designed with certain thicknesses or textures that make it better for creating seals in threaded connections. Meanwhile regular Teflon tape could be used for various purposes not just sealing.  I should also consider their applications. Mechanics use thread seal tape because it's specifically made to prevent leaks when tightening nuts and bolts on pipes or fittings. It's designed to conform to the threads without breaking down under pressure. On the other hand Teflon tape might have different thicknesses or uses beyond just sealing like in cooking or other industrial applications.  So are they the same? Well if both are made from PTFE then yes the material is identical. But their uses and maybe their construction could differ slightly. Thread seal tape is a specific type of Teflon tape designed for sealing purposes. So in that sense thread seal tape is a subset or specialized version of Teflon tape.  But wait sometimes people might refer to any PTFE-based tape as Teflon tape regardless of its use. So maybe they're considered the same product but used differently based on application. However when it comes to their primary function and design thread seal tape is tailored for creating seals in threaded connections while regular Teflon tape might have broader uses.  I think I've heard that some people use Teflon tape as a substitute for thread seal tape but they're not exactly the same product. Thread seal tape might have additional properties or thickness to better suit sealing needs. So while they share the same base material their applications and specific designs differ. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,69.08294779999414,0.024165871967605286,0.007095597588992929,0.0,0.0,0.0
40,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether liquor stores in Oklahoma are open on the 4th of July. Hmm let's start by considering what I know about holidays and business hours in general. Usually businesses have varying hours on holidays—some might be closed others might have reduced hours or even stay open longer.  I remember that in some states there are specific laws regarding alcohol sales on certain days. For example some places restrict alcohol sales on major holidays like the 4th of July because it's considered a day when people might drink more leading to potential issues. But I'm not sure if Oklahoma has such restrictions.  Wait I think Oklahoma does have dry counties in some areas where selling alcohol is prohibited altogether. However there are also wet counties where liquor stores can operate. So the availability of liquor stores on the 4th of July might depend on whether the county is wet or dry.  But even within wet counties there could be specific regulations about holiday hours. I should check if Oklahoma has any state laws that dictate whether liquor stores must close on holidays like the 4th of July. Maybe the state allows them to stay open but with certain restrictions.  I recall that in some states businesses can choose their own hours on holidays unless there's a law preventing it. So perhaps in Oklahoma some liquor stores might be closed while others remain open. It really depends on each individual store's policy and the local laws of their county.  Wait I think I read somewhere that Oklahoma allows alcohol sales on major holidays but maybe with limited hours or specific conditions. For example they might have to close at a certain time or not sell beyond a particular point during the day.  Alternatively it could be that liquor stores in Oklahoma are required by law to close on the 4th of July similar to how some places close on Sundays or other religious holidays. But I'm not entirely sure about this.  To sum up my initial thought is that it's possible for liquor stores in Oklahoma to be open on the 4th of July but it really depends on whether they're in a wet county and what specific regulations apply on that day. Some might be closed due to local laws or business policies while others could remain open. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,64.54152139998041,0.02257601079278796,0.006628781612561801,0.0,0.0,0.0
41,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether you have to be a Mormon to go to BYU. Let me think about this step by step.  First I know that BYU stands for Brigham Young University. From what I remember it's a well-known university in Provo Utah. I've heard that it's associated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which is often referred to as the Mormon Church. So there must be some connection between being Mormon and attending BYU.  I think BYU requires students to follow certain standards. Maybe they have rules based on LDS teachings? For example I believe there are no alcohol or drug policies and maybe some expectations about behavior and lifestyle. But does that mean you have to be a member of the church to attend?  I'm not entirely sure but I recall hearing that while many students at BYU are Mormons it's not a requirement. The university is open to people from all backgrounds but they do emphasize certain values and standards that align with LDS principles. So even if you're not Mormon as long as you adhere to those standards you can attend.  Wait but I'm not 100% certain about this. Maybe there are some specific requirements related to religion? Perhaps attending chapel services or participating in religious activities is mandatory which would make it difficult for non-Mormons to attend. Or maybe they have a different policy where being Mormon isn't required but you still need to follow the code of conduct.  I should also consider the admissions process. Does BYU ask about religious affiliation when admitting students? If so does that affect whether someone is accepted or not? I think they might prioritize LDS members in some contexts especially for certain programs or scholarships but it's not a strict requirement for admission.  In summary while BYU is closely tied to the Mormon Church and has policies influenced by LDS teachings it doesn't necessarily require all students to be Mormons. However following the university's standards which are based on those teachings is essential regardless of one's religious background. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,68.50755369997933,0.02396214089191917,0.007035777950314913,0.0,0.0,0.0
42,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Dr. Burke comes back after Season 3 of ""Grey's Anatomy."" Hmm let me think about this. First I remember that Dr. Burke was a character who was part of the show for several seasons. He was Derek Shepherd's friend and colleague right? But then there was an incident where he shot Derek which led to his departure from the series.  Wait so in Season 3 did something happen to him? Let me recall. I think in Season 3 there was a shooting at the hospital and Dr. Burke was involved. He actually shot Derek Shepherd who was played by Patrick Dempsey. That event was pretty significant because it led to Derek's death which was a major plot point for the show.  After that what happened to Dr. Burke? I believe he was arrested or maybe went to prison as part of his punishment or consequence for shooting Derek. So if he was in jail after Season 3 would he come back later in the series?  I don't remember him returning in any subsequent seasons. The show continued with other characters taking on more prominent roles like Dr. Cristina Yang and others. I think the focus shifted away from Dr. Burke's story after his actions in Season 3.  Also considering that Patrick Dempsey left the show after Season 8 which was around 2015 it's unlikely that Dr. Burke would return because Derek Shepherd his main connection to the show wasn't part of the series anymore. Plus bringing back a character who had such a traumatic event (killing a friend) might not fit with the show's narrative direction.  So putting this all together I don't think Dr. Burke comes back after Season 3. He was written out as being in custody and there wasn't any indication of him returning later on. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,66.26637949998258,0.023181086264443526,0.006806444229643995,0.0,0.0,0.0
43,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if a dog can be a mix of three breeds. Hmm I know that dogs are often bred as mixes like how you have mutts or designer breeds. Usually when people talk about mixed breeds they're referring to two parent breeds. For example a labrador and a poodle might have a labradoodle.  But can there be more than two? Like could a dog have three different breeds in its lineage? I think it's possible because each time you breed dogs you can introduce new genetic traits. So if you cross three breeds maybe the offspring would carry characteristics from all three.  Wait but how does that work genetically? Each parent contributes half their DNA. If you have a first generation mix of two breeds say Breed A and B then you get AB. Now if you take an AB dog and breed it with another breed say C the puppies would be ABC. So technically yes they can have three breeds in them.  I've heard terms like tri-color or trichotomous breeds but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Maybe it's more about the number of breeds mixed rather than color. Also some people might refer to a dog with multiple breed traits as just a multi-breed mix without specifying the exact count.  Another thought: when you have three breeds involved each subsequent generation can dilute or change the proportion of each breed's influence. But in terms of being ""mixed"" with three breeds I think it's possible through intentional breeding practices.  So putting it all together yes a dog can indeed be a mix of three different breeds. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,68.88513020001119,0.02410003935943666,0.007076267779730321,0.0,0.0,0.0
44,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the right atrium receives blood from the lungs. Let me start by recalling what I know about the human heart and circulatory system.  The heart has four chambers: two atria (plural for atrium) on top and two ventricles below. The right side of the heart is responsible for pumping deoxygenated blood to the lungs while the left side pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.  I remember that after the right ventricle sends blood to the lungs via the pulmonary artery the blood returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. Wait no actually the pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs and the pulmonary veins bring the oxygenated blood back to the heart.  So when the blood comes back from the lungs it enters which part of the heart? I think it goes into the left atrium because that's where the oxygenated blood is collected before being sent to the left ventricle. Therefore the right atrium doesn't receive blood directly from the lungs; instead it receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the superior and inferior vena cava.  Wait a second maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me visualize the heart's structure. The right atrium is connected to the right ventricle via the tricuspid valve. The right ventricle then pumps blood into the pulmonary artery towards the lungs. So the right atrium doesn't get blood from the lungs; it gets blood from the body.  The left side of the heart on the other hand receives blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. Then the left atrium sends this oxygenated blood to the left ventricle which pumps it into the aorta and throughout the body.  So putting it all together: The right atrium doesn't receive blood directly from the lungs. Instead it's the left atrium that gets the blood back from the lungs after it has been oxygenated. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,67.37594310002169,0.02356315161539664,0.006918626483472649,0.0,0.0,0.0
45,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether a ""certification of birth"" is the same as a ""birth certificate."" Hmm let me think about this.  First I know that both terms relate to documents related to someone's birth. But are they exactly the same? Let me break it down.  A birth certificate is a legal document that records the details of a person's birth. It usually includes information like the name date and place of birth parents' names and sometimes other details. In many countries this is an official record maintained by government authorities such as the民政局 (civil affairs bureau) in China or the Social Security Administration in the U.S.  Now what about a certification of birth? The term ""certification"" suggests it's a document that confirms or verifies something. So a certification of birth might be a statement confirming the facts of someone's birth. It could be issued by a hospital a medical professional or another authority.  Wait but isn't a birth certificate also a form of certification? Because it certifies the information about the birth. Maybe in some places they use ""certification of birth"" as another term for the birth certificate. But I'm not sure if that's universally true.  I should consider different countries or regions. In some places the terms might be used interchangeably but in others there might be a distinction. For example maybe a certification of birth is an official statement from a medical facility while a birth certificate is the government-issued document.  Also I remember that sometimes people use ""birth certificate"" to refer specifically to the legal document for official purposes like applying for passports or identification. A certification of birth might be more of a supplementary document perhaps used in specific situations where a birth certificate isn't available or needed.  So putting it together: while both terms relate to proving someone's birth they might not always be exactly the same document. The terminology can vary by jurisdiction and one might be considered a subset or alternative term for the other but they could also serve slightly different purposes or come from different issuing authorities. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,69.03465929997037,0.024157850461309232,0.007093242309580265,0.0,0.0,0.0
46,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether every country has its own sign language. Hmm let's start by breaking this down.  First I know that sign languages are visual-gestural systems used for communication especially among deaf individuals. But do all countries have one? Well I'm aware that in many places there is a recognized sign language. For example American Sign Language (ASL) is used in the United States and British Sign Language (BSL) in the UK.  But wait what about smaller countries or those with fewer deaf communities? Does every nation have an established sign language? I'm thinking that some countries might use a form of sign language that's not standardized. Maybe they adapt signs from neighboring countries or use gestures more generally.  I also recall that sometimes especially in places where the deaf community is small there might be no formal sign language but instead a collection of home signs. These are made-up gestures used within families rather than a structured system. So does that count as having a sign language?  Another angle: some countries might use a signed version of their spoken language. For instance Signed French or Signed Spanish. But is that considered the country's own sign language? It seems like it would be because it's tailored to the linguistic structure of the spoken language in that country.  But then again not all countries have a unique sign language. Some might share the same one especially if they are colonized or have cultural ties. For example ASL is also used in parts of Canada and other English-speaking countries. So does each country have its own or do some share?  I'm trying to think of specific examples. What about countries with very small populations? Or perhaps countries where sign language isn't officially recognized? I know that in some places sign languages are not taught formally and deaf individuals might use a mix of gestures and spoken language systems.  Wait but the question is whether every country has their own sign language. So even if it's an adapted version or based on another language as long as there's a system in place does that count? Or does each country need to have a completely unique one?  I think the key here is that while many countries have their own recognized sign languages some might not. For example in countries with small deaf populations they might rely more on gestures or use a signed version of the national language without it being an independent system.  So putting this together: While most countries do have some form of sign language whether standardized or not there are exceptions where either no formal sign language exists or it's borrowed from another country. Therefore it's not true that every single country has its own unique sign language. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,70.3078613000107,0.02460778083066108,0.00722535113016275,0.0,0.0,0.0
47,"<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether ""dry water"" actually exists. Hmm that sounds a bit contradictory at first because water is usually wet right? But maybe it's referring to something else.  I remember hearing about things like ""dry ice "" which isn't really ice but solid carbon dioxide. So maybe ""dry water"" could be another term for something similar. Wait no dry ice is different from regular ice in state not composition.   Then there's the concept of desiccated materials. I think desiccated means dried out or without moisture. Could ""dry water"" refer to some form of dehydrated water? That doesn't make much sense because water itself is H2O; removing all the water would just leave nothing.  Wait maybe it's a term used in chemistry or another field. I recall something about ""powdered water "" which might be a way to store water in a dry form for later use. Or perhaps it's a type of absorbent material that can hold water without being liquid?   I'm not entirely sure but I think there are materials called hydrogels or something similar that can absorb and retain large amounts of water. Maybe ""dry water"" is another name for these kinds of substances. They're used in things like baby diapers or agriculture to retain moisture.  Alternatively could it be a term used in food science? Like dehydrated foods where the water has been removed but that's more about the food than the water itself.  I'm still not certain if ""dry water"" is an established term. It might be a colloquial expression or a misnomer. I should check reliable sources to confirm. From what I can find quickly there isn't a widely recognized scientific term called dry water. However there are products like silica gel packets that absorb moisture but those aren't referred to as dry water.  Wait maybe it's referring to something like anhydrous (without water) compounds. Anhydrous means without water so perhaps ""dry water"" is a layman's term for anhydrous substances. But I'm not sure if that's the case.  In summary while there are materials and processes that deal with retaining or absorbing water in a dry form the exact term ""dry water"" isn't commonly used in scientific contexts. It might be more of a metaphor or a miscommunication. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,70.79334430000745,0.02477605101528728,0.007274758721079956,0.0,0.0,0.0
48,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether all states in the United States enforce a minimum drinking age of 21. Hmm I remember that the legal drinking age is 21 but I'm not sure if every single state follows this rule. Let me think about what I know.  I recall that there was a law passed at the federal level that required states to set their drinking age at 21 or lose some highway funding. That must have been in the late 20th century. So maybe all states comply because of this financial incentive. But wait could any state still have a lower drinking age despite that? I don't think so because the penalties for not complying would be too severe.  I also remember hearing about some exceptions or different rules in certain places like maybe for religious purposes or with parental consent. For example in some states you can drink if it's part of a religious ceremony or if your parents allow it. But does that mean the minimum drinking age is lower than 21? Or is that an exception under specific circumstances?  I think those exceptions don't change the legal minimum age. The law still sets 21 as the standard but allows for these special cases without lowering the overall minimum. So even if there are some allowances the base rule remains 21 across all states.  Another point to consider is whether any state has ever tried to lower their drinking age below 21 and faced consequences. I don't recall any recent news about that happening. Most states seem to stick strictly to 21 because of the federal laws and funding implications.  So putting it all together it seems like every state does enforce a minimum drinking age of 21 even if there are exceptions in certain situations. The financial penalties from the federal government ensure uniformity across all states. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,70.58636469999328,0.02470388991918994,0.007253570737456864,0.0,0.0,0.0
49,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if ""The Mountain Between Us"" is based on a true story. Let me think about this step by step.  First I remember that the movie stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. It's about two people who get stranded in the mountains after a car accident right? They have to survive together in the wilderness.   I wonder if there was any real-life incident that inspired this story. Sometimes movies are based on true events especially survival stories because they can be quite gripping. I think of other movies like ""Cast Away"" or ""127 Hours "" which were based on real people's experiences.  But wait ""The Mountain Between Us"" is more about two individuals stuck together rather than a single person. Maybe it's inspired by a true story where two people were stranded and had to rely on each other for survival. I'm trying to recall if there was any notable case like that in the news or history.  I don't remember hearing about such an incident specifically related to this movie. Sometimes movies take creative liberties even if they're based on real events. They might change details or combine multiple stories to make a more compelling narrative.  Also I think the director and writer of the movie took some creative license with the plot. The characters' dynamics and the challenges they face are probably exaggerated for dramatic effect. So while it's set in a realistic survival scenario it might not be entirely accurate to real events.  I should also consider if there were any interviews or behind-the-scenes information where the creators mentioned it being based on a true story. If I recall correctly some sources say that while the movie is inspired by real-life survival stories it's not directly based on one specific incident. They combined elements from various cases to create the plot.  Therefore putting this all together ""The Mountain Between Us"" isn't a direct adaptation of a true story but rather an fictionalized version inspired by real events. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,70.32424309998169,0.024612693821016805,0.007226793685290475,0.0,0.0,0.0
50,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there are any tolls on I-70 in Kansas. Let me start by recalling what I know about toll roads. Tolls are fees charged for using certain highways or bridges often managed by state or federal authorities.  I remember that some states have toll roads like the ones in New Jersey or Ohio but others don't. I'm not sure about Kansas specifically. Maybe I should think about which parts of I-70 pass through Kansas and if those sections have tolls.  I know that I-70 runs from near San Francisco to near Baltimore passing through several states including California Nevada Utah Colorado Kansas Missouri Illinois Indiana Ohio West Virginia and Maryland. So in Kansas it's a significant route.  I think about whether Kansas has any toll roads. From what I've heard before most of the highways in Kansas are free to use. However there might be exceptions or specific segments that have been converted into toll roads for funding purposes.  Wait I recall something about the Kansas Turnpike. The Kansas Turnpike is a major highway in the state and it does have tolls. But is the Kansas Turnpike part of I-70? Let me check that mentally. I think I-70 runs parallel to parts of the Kansas Turnpike but isn't the same road.  So if someone is driving on I-70 through Kansas they might not encounter toll booths because I-70 itself doesn't have tolls. However if they take a segment that's part of the Kansas Turnpike which is a separate highway then yes there would be tolls.  But the question specifically asks about I-70 in Kansas so unless I-70 has been converted into a toll road the answer should be no. From what I know I-70 in Kansas doesn't have tolls; it's a free highway.  I can also think about other states on I-70 and whether they have tolls. For example in Missouri or Ohio there might be some toll roads but that's not relevant here since the question is focused on Kansas.  Another angle: sometimes states introduce new toll systems or convert existing highways to toll roads. But as of my last update I don't think I-70 in Kansas has been made into a toll road. The main toll road in Kansas is the Turnpike which isn't part of I-70.  So putting it all together I-70 in Kansas doesn't have tolls because it's not part of the toll system in that state. Therefore the answer should be False. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,72.48221089996514,0.025370392629497144,0.007449269656604192,0.0,0.0,0.0
51,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Trinity Forest Golf Club is a public course. Hmm I'm not too familiar with all the golf courses but I'll try to think it through.  First what's the difference between a public and private golf course? Public courses are open to anyone right? You can just pay and play whenever you want. Private clubs usually require membership or have restricted access; sometimes they're exclusive or part of country clubs.  I remember hearing that Trinity Forest is in Texas maybe near Dallas? I think it's one of those newer courses that became popular because of some tournaments or famous players. But wait isn't it associated with a university? Maybe SMU (Southern Methodist University)? If it's affiliated with a university does that make it public or private?  If Trinity Forest is part of a university perhaps it's used for the school's golf teams but also open to the public. That would mean it's a public course because anyone can pay to play there even if the primary users are students and faculty.  Alternatively maybe it's a private club that just happens to have some public access. But I think most university-affiliated courses are public since they need revenue and want to serve the community.  I should also consider if there are any membership requirements. If you can join without being a student or staff member of the university then it's likely public. If only members or students can play it might be private.  Another angle: looking up recent information or articles about Trinity Forest. I recall that it hosted some professional events which usually happen on courses that are accessible to the public because they need to accommodate a large number of players and spectators.  Putting this together it seems more likely that Trinity Forest Golf Club is a public course since it's associated with a university and hosts public events. Therefore the answer should be True. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,72.41797690000385,0.025353782788920223,0.0074443926654114406,0.0,0.0,0.0
52,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the away goal counts in the playoffs. Hmm I'm a bit confused about this because I know that in some sports home advantage can play a role but I'm not sure how it applies here.  First I should clarify what ""away goal"" means. In soccer for example an away goal is a goal scored by a team while they're playing on the opponent's field. But I'm not sure if this question is about soccer or another sport. Wait the user didn't specify but since they mentioned playoffs maybe it's referring to a league like MLS or the World Cup.  In some tournaments especially knockout stages away goals can be significant because if the score is tied after two legs (home and away) the team that scored more away goals might advance. But I'm not sure if this applies to all sports or just specific ones.  Wait but in other sports like hockey or basketball there's no concept of an ""away goal."" They just have points or baskets. So maybe the question is about soccer. In soccer playoffs particularly in tournaments where teams play two-legged matches away goals do count and can be crucial if scores are tied.  However I'm not entirely certain because different leagues might have different rules. For example in some cases if the total score is tied after both legs they might go into extra time or penalty shootouts instead of considering away goals. But I think in many cases especially in UEFA competitions away goals are indeed considered.  Wait but the user asked specifically about playoffs. So maybe it's referring to a specific league's playoff structure. For instance in MLS playoffs do they use away goals? I'm not sure. They might just go by total goals without considering home advantage beyond the possible tiebreakers like overtime or penalty kicks.  Alternatively in some tournaments the away goal rule is used as a tiebreaker after aggregate goals. So if two teams have the same number of goals over two legs the team with more away goals wins. If they still tie then it goes to other tiebreakers.  But I'm not 100% sure if this applies universally in all playoff structures. It might depend on the specific competition's rules. However given that the user is asking a general question without specifying a sport or league I think the answer would be True because in many sports and especially in soccer playoffs away goals do count as part of the scoring system. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,75.31735090000439,0.026368914723212726,0.007742456303054283,0.0,0.0,0.0
53,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether money from Guernsey is legal tender in the UK. Hmm let's break this down.  First I know that Guernsey is part of the Channel Islands and it's a British dependency but it has its own government and currency. The Guernsey pound is their local currency. Now the question is whether this can be used as legal tender in the UK.  I remember that legal tender means the money must be accepted by law when offered to settle a debt or pay for goods and services. In the UK the official currency is the British pound sterling (GBP). So would Guernsey pounds be considered the same?  Wait I think Guernsey has its own notes and coins but they're pegged to the GBP. But are they fully interchangeable? I'm not sure if they have the same status.  I should consider that while Guernsey is part of the UK in some ways it's a separate jurisdiction with its own financial system. So their currency might not be recognized as legal tender in the UK. Instead people usually exchange them to GBP before using them in the UK.  Also I recall that sometimes territories issue their own currencies that are pegged but aren't considered legal tender elsewhere. For example Hong Kong dollars aren't accepted in mainland China even though they're part of China.  So putting it together Guernsey pounds likely aren't legal tender in the UK because the UK uses its own pound and Guernsey is a separate entity with its own currency system. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,69.22039579998818,0.024230788319874293,0.007114658366657548,0.0,0.0,0.0
54,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" is an autobiography. Let me start by recalling what I know about this book. It's written by Maya Angelou right? I remember that it's one of her most famous works. Now I think she wrote several books and some of them are autobiographies.  Wait so ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" is actually the first part of her autobiography series. The title itself comes from a poem by Paul Laurence Dunbar if I'm not mistaken. So it's about her life experiences growing up. She talks about her childhood including being sent away to live with her grandmother after her parents split up.  I think she also touches on some pretty heavy topics in the book like racial discrimination and sexual abuse. These are real-life events that happened to her which makes me believe it's an autobiography because it's based on her personal experiences.  But wait could it be a novel instead? Sometimes authors write semi-autobiographical novels where they take elements from their life but fictionalize the rest. However in this case I'm pretty sure Maya Angelou wrote about her own life so it's more of an autobiography than fiction.  I should also consider that she wrote several volumes of her memoirs and ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" is just the first one. That further confirms that it's part of her autobiography series rather than a standalone novel or work of fiction.  So putting it all together: It's based on her real life details specific events from her childhood and is part of a larger autobiographical series. Therefore yes it's an autobiography. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,73.02896600001259,0.025571091104454016,0.0075081988612663506,0.0,0.0,0.0
55,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the transmission and engine are the same thing. Hmm let's start by understanding what each of these components does in a vehicle.  First the engine. From what I know the engine is responsible for converting fuel into mechanical energy. It generates power through combustion or other means which then drives the vehicle. So it's like the heart of the car that makes everything move.  Now the transmission. I think the transmission system is what takes the power from the engine and transfers it to the wheels. There are different types like manual automatic CVT etc. The transmission changes the speed and torque of the engine so that it can be used effectively by the wheels under various driving conditions.  Wait a minute so the engine creates power and the transmission delivers that power. They both are essential but serve different purposes. The engine is about generating power while the transmission is about managing how that power gets to the wheels.  I don't think they're the same because their functions are distinct. If one fails the other can still function in some capacity though the vehicle wouldn't move properly without either. For example if the engine stops the car won't have any power but the transmission might still engage gears. Conversely a broken transmission would mean the engine's power can't be transferred to the wheels.  Also from a mechanical standpoint they are separate systems with different parts and mechanisms. The engine has cylinders pistons valves etc. while the transmission includes gears shafts clutches or torque converters depending on its type.  So putting it all together the engine and transmission work together but aren't the same thing. They have distinct roles in a vehicle's operation. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,70.7607167000242,0.02477464862119707,0.0072743469492995445,0.0,0.0,0.0

The first one was ""Raiders of the Lost Ark "" which came out in 1981. Then there's ""Temple of Doom "" released in 1984 and after that ""The Last Crusade"" in 1989 followed by ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" in 2008.  Now a prequel is a story that takes place before the main series' timeline. So if ""Temple of Doom"" were a prequel it would have to be set before ""Raiders."" But I remember watching ""Temple of Doom "" and it actually feels like it's set after ""Raiders."" In fact in ""The Last Crusade "" there are references to events from ""Temple of Doom "" which suggests that it comes after.  Also the timeline makes sense: ""Raiders"" is when Indy gets the ark then later he goes on another adventure in ""Temple of Doom "" and then continues his journey. So no ""Temple of Doom"" isn't a prequel; it's part of the same chronological order following ""Raiders."" </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,71.60965849997592,0.02508176398771172,0.0073645223444644805,0.0,0.0,0.0
57,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Canadian dollar is worth more than the USD. Hmm let's start by understanding what it means for a currency to be ""worth more."" Typically this refers to its exchange rate relative to another currency. So if one CAD is equal to more than one USD then yes the Canadian dollar would be considered stronger or worth more.  I remember that exchange rates fluctuate constantly based on various economic factors. Canada's economy relies heavily on natural resources especially oil while the US has a much larger and diversified economy. Geopolitical events interest rates inflation and trade balances all play significant roles in determining currency values.  In recent years I've heard that sometimes the Canadian dollar is stronger than the USD especially when oil prices are high because Canada exports a lot of oil. Conversely when oil prices drop the CAD tends to weaken. Also the US has a more stable and larger economy which can make the USD a safer investment during times of uncertainty.  I should also consider the current economic indicators. For example if Canada's inflation rate is lower than the US's that might make its currency stronger because it retains purchasing power better. On the other hand higher interest rates in one country can attract foreign investors increasing demand for that currency.  Looking at historical trends there have been periods where CAD was above USD and times when it was below. For instance around 2014-2015 due to high oil prices the Canadian dollar was quite strong against the US dollar. But after oil prices fell the CAD weakened.  However as of my last update in July 2024 I don't have real-time data so I can't say for sure where the exchange rate stands right now. It's possible that due to recent economic developments or global events the value could have changed.  In summary whether the Canadian dollar is worth more than the USD depends on current market conditions and various economic factors. Without specific up-to-date information it's hard to give a definitive answer. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,73.08361670002341,0.02559119784757222,0.0075141026150470245,0.0,0.0,0.0
58,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether there's ever been a perfect tennis match. Hmm what does ""perfect"" mean here? Maybe it means a match where everything went perfectly for one player without any mistakes. Let me think about how tennis matches work.  Tennis is a sport with a lot of variables—players can make errors get nervous have bad shots. Even the best players sometimes miss easy points or double fault. So if someone plays a perfect match they wouldn't make any unforced errors right? They'd win every point they played.  I remember watching some top players like Serena Williams or Roger Federer. They're amazing but even they have moments where they slip up. I don't think I've ever seen a player win 100% of their points in a match. Maybe in shorter matches like if someone is playing against a much weaker opponent they might not make many errors but still it's hard to imagine zero mistakes.  Also considering the rules of tennis you can lose points even when you're trying your best—like if the ball touches the net during a serve or if there's a let. Those aren't errors on the player's part but they still result in lost points. So maybe ""perfect"" would mean not just no unforced errors but also avoiding any such minor infractions.  I wonder if any records exist about this. Maybe some ATP or WTA tournaments have tracked perfect matches but I don't recall hearing about one. It seems extremely rare if it's even happened at all.  So putting it all together a perfect tennis match would require a player to win every point without making any mistakes and avoiding any minor rule infractions. Given how competitive tennis is and the physical and mental demands it's highly unlikely such a match has ever occurred. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,75.09356879998813,0.026294339599854378,0.0077205595113221375,0.0,0.0,0.0
59,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse's house is still located in the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World. Let me start by recalling what I know about Disney parks.  I remember that in Disneyland there's a specific area called ""Mickey's ToonTown"" which includes their houses. But when it comes to Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom I'm not as sure. I think the Magic Kingdom has various themed lands like Main Street U.S.A. Fantasyland Adventureland etc.  Wait in the Magic Kingdom there's a place called ""Main Street U.S.A."" which is designed to look like a small town from the early 20th century. I believe that area includes some shops and maybe attractions. But does it have actual houses for Mickey and Minnie?  I'm trying to remember if there are any specific areas or attractions related to their homes. There's ""Mickey's Birthday Party"" which is an attraction but that's not a physical house. Maybe in the past there was a place where you could meet them in their home setting.  I think I've heard that in the Magic Kingdom Mickey and Minnie don't have a dedicated house like they do in Disneyland. Instead they might be found in parades or other events around the park. So perhaps their ""house"" isn't an actual building anymore if it ever was.  Wait maybe there's a specific area I'm forgetting. Let me think about any changes or updates to the Magic Kingdom. There have been expansions and renovations over the years. Maybe their house was removed or replaced with something else.  I also recall that in Disney World character meet-and-greets are often held in designated areas rather than in specific houses. So it's possible that Mickey and Minnie don't have a traditional house anymore in the Magic Kingdom.  So putting this together I think the answer is False because their house isn't part of the current layout of the Magic Kingdom. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,68.01316440000664,0.023812539635662697,0.006991851941163382,0.0,0.0,0.0
60,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether chewing tobacco is banned in Major League Baseball. Let me start by recalling what I know about MLB policies regarding substances used by players.  I remember that there have been several health-related rules imposed on players over the years. Chewing tobacco is a product that's often associated with baseball but I think there have been efforts to reduce its use due to health concerns especially since it can lead to mouth cancer and other issues.  From what I've heard MLB has had policies against smokeless tobacco for some time. I believe they don't allow players to use it during games or in public areas. There might be specific rules about where and when it's permitted. For example maybe players are allowed to use it in the dugout but not while on the field during a game.  I should check if there have been any recent changes. I think in 2019 MLB made some updates to their tobacco policies. They might have banned the use of all forms of tobacco including chewing tobacco and snuff both in the clubhouse and during games. However I'm not entirely sure if this is still the case or if there are any exceptions.  I also recall that some players have been fined for violating these rules which suggests that the policy is enforced. Additionally there might be programs in place to help players quit using tobacco products showing MLB's commitment to reducing their use among athletes.  So putting it all together I think chewing tobacco is indeed banned in Major League Baseball with strict policies in place to prevent its use during games and in public areas associated with the sport. However there might still be some allowances in more private spaces like the clubhouse but overall the trend is towards banning it entirely. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,73.19243430002825,0.025632424576817546,0.0075262076316186316,0.0,0.0,0.0
61,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's still a water crisis in Cape Town. Let me start by recalling what I know about this. I remember hearing a few years ago that Cape Town was facing a severe water shortage even risking running out of water which was called ""Day Zero."" That was pretty alarming and got a lot of attention.  Now the question is whether this crisis still exists today. I think after those initial reports there were efforts to manage the situation. Maybe they implemented water restrictions or found ways to conserve water. I wonder if the situation has improved since then.  I should consider factors like current water levels in reservoirs rainfall patterns and any ongoing conservation measures. If Cape Town's dams are at a healthy level now that might indicate improvement. On the other hand if they're still below capacity or if there's been recent droughts the crisis could persist.  Also I should think about whether the city has diversified its water sources like desalination plants or wastewater recycling. These solutions can help alleviate water stress. If such projects are in place and operational that would support the idea that the crisis is under control.  However even if immediate threats have been managed there might still be underlying issues like infrastructure problems or overuse that could lead to future crises. So it's possible that while Day Zero has passed there's still a need for vigilance regarding water usage.  I should also look into recent news articles or official statements from Cape Town authorities about the current state of their water supply. If they've declared the crisis over or if they're still issuing warnings that would be useful information.  In summary I think the immediate danger of Day Zero has probably been averted through conservation and management efforts. But whether there's still a water crisis depends on how sustainable these measures are and if there are ongoing challenges with water supply. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,67.38805809998303,0.023605499336936647,0.006931060646463391,0.0,0.0,0.0

Guitar Center is a well-known retailer that sells musical instruments especially guitars. They have a lot of stores across the US and an online presence. I've heard they offer a wide range of products including guitars amplifiers accessories and even music lessons.  Musicians Friend on the other hand I'm less familiar with. The name suggests it's another company catering to musicians probably selling similar items like instruments and gear. But I don't remember hearing that they're part of Guitar Center or vice versa.  I should check if there have been any recent mergers or acquisitions between them. Maybe one bought the other? I think Guitar Center has been around longer so perhaps Musicians Friend is a different entity. Also their branding seems distinct—Guitar Center's logo and marketing are quite recognizable while Musicians Friend might have its own separate identity.  Looking at their websites could help. If they both have e-commerce sites checking the ""About Us"" sections or any corporate information might reveal ownership. I don't recall seeing any announcements that they're under the same parent company.  Another angle is to look for news articles or press releases mentioning a partnership or acquisition between Guitar Center and Musicians Friend. If such an announcement exists it would likely be reported in industry news or business sections.  I also think about their product offerings. While both sell musical instruments Guitar Center might have a broader range including more high-end or exclusive products. Musicians Friend could focus on different aspects like specific genres or types of musicians but that doesn't necessarily mean they're the same company.  In summary based on my knowledge and without any evidence of a merger or acquisition it seems unlikely that Guitar Center and Musicians Friend are the same company. They appear to be separate entities operating in the same market but independently. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,73.44230100000277,0.025727151358751286,0.007554021365234498,0.0,0.0,0.0
63,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Beckett from the TV show ""Castle"" ever finds out who killed her mom. Let me think about this step by step.  First I remember that Beckett's mother was a significant character in the series. Her mother was a crime writer who was murdered which is a major plot point in the show. The question is whether Beckett discovers the identity of her mom's killer.  I recall that throughout the series there were several suspects and twists regarding her mother's murder. There was a lot of mystery surrounding it with various characters being implicated at different times. I think one of the main arcs involved trying to find out who did it especially since Beckett was determined to solve her own mother's case.  I believe that towards the end of the series there was a big reveal about her mother's murderer. If I'm not mistaken it turned out to be someone close to her family or maybe even someone she trusted. There might have been some red herrings and twists leading up to that point.  Wait wasn't there an episode where they revealed that her mother had an affair with a man who later became a suspect? Or was it someone else entirely? I think the killer was someone from her mom's past possibly connected to her work as a crime writer. Maybe a character who had been in the shadows for a long time finally came forward.  I'm pretty sure that by the end of the series Beckett did find out who killed her mother. It might have been a shocking twist perhaps involving someone she didn't expect. This revelation probably brought closure to her personal journey and was a key part of her character development.  So putting it all together yes I think Beckett does find out who killed her mom in the show. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,68.02130460002809,0.023823857929702468,0.006995175225339007,0.0,0.0,0.0

Florida was one of the Confederate states so it's possible there were some conflicts there.  I remember that Florida had a significant role in the war especially with blockade running and supplying goods to the Confederacy. But did actual battles happen on its soil?  Wait I think there was something about Fort Pickens in Pensacola. Was that part of the Civil War? I'm not entirely certain if it was a battle or just a fortification.  Also there's St. Augustine; maybe there were some skirmishes there. But I'm not sure if those count as major battles.  I recall hearing about the Battle of Olustee in Florida. That sounds familiar. It was a significant engagement so that must be one. There might have been others too but I can't remember any specifics.  So putting it all together yes there were Civil War battles in Florida like the Battle of Olustee and possibly some smaller skirmishes. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,70.54435690000537,0.024713472779839853,0.007256384462656366,0.0,0.0,0.0
65,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether someone can receive the death penalty if they were a minor when committing a crime. Hmm minors are people under 18 right? I remember hearing that some countries have different laws about this.  I think in the United States there's something about the Supreme Court making rulings on this. Wasn't there a case where they said it's unconstitutional to execute someone for crimes committed when they were a minor? Maybe like Thompson v. Oklahoma or Atkins v. Virginia?  Wait I'm not sure about the exact cases but I think the Supreme Court has ruled that executing minors is cruel and unusual punishment which would make it unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. So in the US you can't get the death penalty if you were a minor at the time of the crime.  But what about other countries? I know some countries have different laws. For example Iran allows the execution of minors but I'm not certain about all the details. It might depend on the country's legal system and international treaties they've ratified.  Also there are international conventions like the Convention on the Rights of the Child that prohibit the death penalty for minors. But not all countries adhere to these conventions so it varies globally.  So putting this together in some places you can get the death penalty as a minor but in others especially in the US and many Western countries it's prohibited by law or considered unconstitutional. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,65.40814710000996,0.022907495731870776,0.006726112416006283,0.0,0.0,0.0
66,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if boiling point is a characteristic property of matter. Hmm let's start by understanding what a characteristic property of matter is. From what I remember characteristic properties are unique traits that help identify and classify substances. They don't change regardless of the amount of the substance or its form.  So boiling point is the temperature at which a liquid turns into gas under standard atmospheric pressure. Each pure substance has a specific boiling point. For example water boils at 100°C and mercury at around 356.9°C. These are fixed values for each substance right?  Wait but does this hold true in all situations? Like if you change the pressure the boiling point changes. But under standard conditions it's consistent. So as a characteristic property it should be considered constant because we usually refer to standard conditions when talking about such properties.  Also boiling point is used in various identification methods like distillation which relies on different substances having different boiling points. This makes me think that yes it's a defining feature of matter.  I don't see any flaws in this reasoning. Boiling point doesn't vary with the amount or purity (as long as it's pure) so it fits the criteria of a characteristic property. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,61.23358999998891,0.021453120726388986,0.0062990779685747214,0.0,0.0,0.0
67,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Trinidad and Tobago were in the World Cup in 2018. Let me start by recalling what I know about the World Cup. The World Cup is a major international football tournament held every four years. The 2018 edition was hosted in Russia.  I remember that qualifying for the World Cup can be quite competitive especially for smaller nations. Trinidad and Tobago is a Caribbean nation so they might have to go through several rounds of qualification to make it into the finals.  Thinking about recent tournaments I'm not sure if Trinidad and Tobago made it to the 2018 World Cup. They did participate in some previous editions like in 2006 when they were part of a group that included Germany Austria and Poland. But I don't recall them being there in 2018.  I should consider how the qualification process works. For the 2018 World Cup CONCACAF (the North American Central American and Caribbean region) had several teams competing for a limited number of spots. The top teams from each group stage would advance to the next rounds and eventually only a few would qualify.  I think that in recent years Trinidad and Tobago has faced challenges in their football performance which might have affected their ability to qualify. They might not have performed well enough in the qualifiers to make it through.  Also I remember hearing about Panama qualifying for the 2018 World Cup which was a big deal for them. If Panama made it maybe Trinidad and Tobago didn't as there are only so many spots available.  Another point is that sometimes teams have to go through play-offs after the group stages. If Trinidad and Tobago lost in those play-offs they wouldn't make it to the main tournament.  Putting this all together I think Trinidad and Tobago did not participate in the 2018 World Cup because they didn't qualify. They might have been eliminated in earlier rounds of qualification or lost a crucial playoff match. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,68.06377559999237,0.023843248829108397,0.007000868792666416,0.0,0.0,0.0
68,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether North Korea and South Korea speak the same language. Hmm I know that both countries were once part of a single country before it was divided after World War II. So they share a lot of cultural similarities but I'm not sure about their languages.  I remember hearing that Korean is spoken in both countries but maybe there are differences because they've been separated for so long. Maybe the vocabulary or accents have changed? I think South Korea has adopted more English terms and uses a lot of technology-related jargon while North Korea might still use older terminology since it's more isolated.  Also I recall that after the division each side developed their own versions of Korean. The North might have some unique words or phrases not used in the South and vice versa. Plus the way they write might be slightly different because of different policies and influences over the years.  So putting it all together while both countries speak Korean there are noticeable differences due to their separate developments post-division. Therefore I think the answer is False. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,63.89415429998189,0.02238184411431799,0.006571770277838967,0.0,0.0,0.0
69,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether it's rare to have six wisdom teeth. Hmm let me think about this step by step.  First I know that wisdom teeth are the third molars and usually appear in the late teens or early twenties. Most people have four wisdom teeth one in each corner of the mouth. But sometimes people have fewer like three or two or even none at all. So having six seems unusual because there are only four corners in the mouth.  Wait but maybe I'm missing something. Could someone have more than four wisdom teeth? I remember hearing that some people can have extra teeth called supernumerary teeth which could include extra wisdom teeth. But how common is that?  I think supernumerary teeth are rare. They occur when there's an extra tooth developing in the dental arch. These can appear anywhere but having them as wisdom teeth would mean they're located where the third molars usually are. So if someone has six wisdom teeth that would mean two sets of third molars on each side—like two upper and two lower.  I should check how often this happens. From what I recall supernumerary teeth aren't very common. The exact prevalence varies but it's generally considered rare. So having six wisdom teeth would be a specific case of having extra teeth in the wisdom area.  Also considering that each quadrant typically has one wisdom tooth having two in a quadrant is already unusual. So across all four quadrants that would mean eight wisdom teeth if each had two but the question is about six. Maybe two quadrants have two each and the others have one? Or perhaps it's just an extra in some areas.  I think the key point here is whether having six is rare. Since supernumerary teeth are uncommon having six wisdom teeth would indeed be a rare occurrence. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,60.668010399997,0.02125414826543101,0.0062406555571615525,0.0,0.0,0.0
70,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Aslan comes back to life in Narnia. Hmm I remember reading the Chronicles of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis. Let me think about each book and see where Aslan is mentioned.  In ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe "" Aslan is a powerful lion who helps the Pevensie children. He dies at the hands of the White Witch but then comes back to life through his magic and sacrifice. That's in that first book. Then in ""Prince Caspian "" I think he appears again as a grown lion so maybe he didn't die there.  Wait does Aslan come back to life more than once? In ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe "" he definitely dies and then comes back. But in later books like ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" or ""The Silver Chair "" do they bring him back again?  I think each time Narnia's stories are told Aslan might be present in some form but his actual resurrection happens only once in the first book. So does that mean he comes back to life just once? Or is it considered multiple times across different books?  Wait no because each story is a separate adventure so maybe each time they go back to Narnia Aslan is there as a living lion again. But I'm not sure if that counts as him coming back to life each time or if it's just part of the world.  I think in ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe "" his death and resurrection are central to the plot. In other books he might appear without dying so maybe only once does he come back to life. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,61.81865520001156,0.021650129279321497,0.006356923736154423,0.0,0.0,0.0
71,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether cows have to keep getting pregnant to produce milk. Hmm let me think about this step by step.  First I know that cows are dairy animals and they're often kept for their milk production. But does that mean they need to be pregnant all the time? That doesn't seem right because if they were always pregnant they'd probably have health issues or produce less milk over time.  I remember from biology class that mammals produce milk after giving birth. So cows must give birth to calves to start producing milk. But once they've had a calf do they continue lactating without needing to be pregnant again? I think so because farmers can milk them for several months before the milk production starts to drop.  Wait but if you don't breed them again will their milk supply just stop after a certain period? I believe that's the case. Cows have something called lactation cycles. They produce milk in response to giving birth and milking. So without getting pregnant again they'll eventually dry off when their body stops producing milk.  So cows don't need to be continuously pregnant to keep producing milk. They can lactate for a certain period after calving but over time their milk production decreases and they might stop unless bred again. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,58.523288099997444,0.02049421984820661,0.006017524926812566,0.0,0.0,0.0
72,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's a Grey's Anatomy Season 14. Let me think about this. I know that Grey's Anatomy has been on for a while now. I remember hearing it started around the early 2000s maybe 2005 or something like that. So how many seasons does it have?  I think each season is about 20 episodes or so. They usually air new episodes every year right? So if it's been on for say 18 years that would make 18 seasons. But wait sometimes they do midseason premieres or have shorter seasons but I don't think that affects the overall count.  I also recall that Grey's Anatomy has had some major events in recent seasons like the plane crash in Season 15 which was a big deal. So if Season 15 is out then Season 14 must have come before that. That would mean Season 14 exists because it's the one leading up to Season 15.  I can also think about when I last watched an episode. If I remember watching up to around 2020 or so and knowing that each season comes out yearly then by 2023 they would have had several more seasons. So adding those up Season 14 definitely exists because it's been a few years since the show started and it continues to air new episodes every year.  I don't think there was any cancellation or hiatus that would skip a season. The show has been pretty consistent in its release schedule. Therefore I'm pretty confident that Grey's Anatomy does have a Season 14. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,58.74804500001483,0.02057511073523459,0.006041276156800734,0.0,0.0,0.0
73,"<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether it's possible to have multiple foreign keys in a single database table. Let me think through this step by step.  First I remember that a foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that references the primary key of another table. This helps establish relationships between different tables in a relational database. Now can a table have more than one foreign key?  I recall that databases like SQL Server and MySQL allow for multiple constraints on a table. For example you can have multiple primary keys or unique constraints. So by extension having multiple foreign keys should be possible because they are just another type of constraint.  Let me consider an example. Suppose I have a table called ""Orders"" with columns OrderID CustomerID and ProductID. If CustomerID is a foreign key referencing the Customers table's CustomerID and ProductID references the Products table's ProductID then both CustomerID and ProductID would be foreign keys in the Orders table. This makes sense because an order can have one customer and multiple products.  Another thought: when designing a database it's common to have junction tables for many-to-many relationships which inherently have multiple foreign keys pointing to different tables. For instance a ""UserRoles"" table might have UserID (foreign key to Users) and RoleID (foreign key to Roles). This is a clear case of having two foreign keys in one table.  I should also think about the syntax. In SQL when creating a table with multiple foreign keys you can define each foreign key constraint separately. For example:  CREATE TABLE Orders (   OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY    CustomerID INT    ProductID INT    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID) );  This syntax is valid and demonstrates that multiple foreign keys can exist in a single table.  Are there any limitations? Well each foreign key must reference a primary key or unique constraint in another table. As long as the referenced columns are properly defined having multiple foreign keys shouldn't cause issues.  I also remember that some databases might have specific constraints or require certain configurations but generally supporting multiple foreign keys is standard across relational database management systems.  So putting it all together yes a single table can indeed have multiple foreign keys. It's a common practice used in various database designs to model complex relationships between tables. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,61.60733790002996,0.021580432532319956,0.006336459336167212,0.0,0.0,0.0
74,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether you have to pay to watch ITV Hub. Let me think about this step by step.  First I know that ITV is a major British TV network. They offer their content through various platforms including their website and apps which is where ITV Hub comes in. From what I remember many streaming services require a subscription or payment but sometimes they have free tiers or ad-supported versions.  I think ITV Hub might be similar to other UK channels' online services. For example BBC iPlayer is free because it's funded by the license fee but that's different since it's a public service broadcaster. ITV on the other hand is a commercial channel so they probably have some form of payment involved.  I recall seeing ads when I watch ITV Hub before. That makes me think there might be a free version with commercials which would mean you don't have to pay but you get interrupted by ads. Alternatively maybe there's an option to subscribe for an ad-free experience like with other services such as Netflix or Amazon Prime.  So putting this together: the basic access is likely free because it's supported by ads but if you want to remove those ads or get more features you might have to pay through a subscription. Therefore while you don't have to pay to watch ITV Hub content there are paid options available for an enhanced viewing experience.  I should also consider any recent changes. Sometimes services switch their models so maybe the payment structure has been updated. But as of my last knowledge update in July 2024 the free tier with ads was still available. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,58.38358369999332,0.02045114774501457,0.006004878070453648,0.0,0.0,0.0
75,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Rocky Balboa is in the Boxing Hall of Fame. First off Rocky Balboa is a character from the movies right? He's played by Sylvester Stallone in the ""Rocky"" series. Now the question is whether he's actually inducted into any real-life boxing hall of fame.  I know that the actual Boxing Hall of Fame usually honors real boxers who've had significant careers and achievements. Rocky Balboa isn't a real person; he's a fictional character. So does that mean he can't be inducted? I think so because halls of fame typically recognize people who have done something notable in their field which in this case would be boxing.  But wait maybe there's some kind of pop culture category or something where they honor characters from movies? I'm not sure. The main Boxing Hall of Fame doesn't seem to include fictional characters. They focus on real athletes and their contributions to the sport.  So putting it together: Rocky Balboa is a movie character not a real boxer. Therefore he's not in the Boxing Hall of Fame. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,55.109473999997135,0.01930057369674854,0.005667045839372632,0.0,0.0,0.0
76,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Call of Duty Black Ops 3 has zombies. Hmm I remember that the Black Ops series is known for its zombie modes. Let me think... The first Black Ops had a zombie mode called ""Zombie Survival "" right? Then Black Ops II definitely had a lot with itsombies and different maps. Now Black Ops 3 which came out in 2015 I believe it also included zombies as a major part of the game.  I think there were several zombie maps in Black Ops 3 like ""Outbreak"" which was a big map with lots of areas to explore. There were different modes too such as Survival and Apocalypse. The gameplay involved fighting waves of zombies while scavenging for weapons and items. Plus there were power-ups and special events during the matches.  I'm pretty sure that Treyarch who developed the zombie mode for Black Ops 3 continued the tradition from previous games. They added new features like airdrops which allowed players to call in reinforcements or better weapons. Also there was a map called ""Kino der Toten"" which was a fan-favorite from earlier games but I think it was reimagined for Black Ops 3.  So putting this all together yes Call of Duty Black Ops 3 definitely has zombies as part of its gameplay. The zombie mode was well-received and added a lot of content to the game. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,60.59518519998528,0.021218608130882423,0.006230220241880835,0.0,0.0,0.0
77,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if log x is the same as ln x. Hmm let's start by recalling what each of these functions stands for.   I know that ""log"" usually refers to a logarithm but which base? Sometimes it can be base 10 especially in common usage or in some scientific contexts. For example when people talk about the pH scale they're using log base 10.  On the other hand ""ln x"" is specifically the natural logarithm. The 'n' here stands for 'natural ' which means it's based on the number e approximately equal to 2.71828. So ln x is log base e of x.  Wait but sometimes in math classes or certain textbooks when they just write ""log"" without any base specified do they mean natural logarithm? I think that might be the case in higher-level mathematics like calculus where e is more commonly used because it's so important in growth and decay problems. But in other areas like basic algebra or general science log usually means base 10.  So if someone writes log x without specifying the base it could be ambiguous. It depends on the context. In many cases especially in higher mathematics log might default to natural logarithm but I'm not entirely sure about that universally.   Let me think of examples. If I see log x in a calculus textbook they're probably using ln x because e is more relevant there. But if it's in a chemistry or biology context they're likely using base 10.  Therefore unless specified otherwise log x and ln x are not the same because their bases differ—one is 10 and the other is e. So generally speaking they aren't equivalent. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,55.239869200013345,0.01934934297057117,0.005681365502334377,0.0,0.0,0.0
78,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the internal intercostal muscles contract during inspiration. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about respiratory muscles.  I remember that during inhalation or inspiration certain muscles help expand the ribcage to increase lung volume. The main muscles involved are the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles. The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle located below the ribs and when it contracts it moves downward creating more space in the chest cavity which allows the lungs to expand.  Now what about the internal intercostal muscles? I think these are located between the ribs as well but they might have a different function. The external intercostals run from one rib to the next and help pull the ribcage upward and outward during inspiration. But the internal ones... I'm not entirely sure.  Wait maybe the internal intercostal muscles work in the opposite way? If the external intercostals are pulling the ribs up and out perhaps the internal ones might be doing something else like compressing the chest when exhaling. So during exhalation when you're pushing air out those internal muscles might contract to help push the ribs inward.  But I'm not 100% certain. Let me think about muscle actions. The diaphragm is a primary inspiratory muscle and the external intercostals assist by lifting the ribcage. If the internal intercostals were involved in inspiration they would probably aid in expanding the chest further but I don't recall that being the case.  In fact during exhalation especially when you exhale forcefully like when you're coughing or running other muscles might come into play such as the abdominal muscles pushing the diaphragm up. But for normal quiet breathing it's mainly the external intercostals and the diaphragm that are active.  So putting this together during inspiration the internal intercostal muscles probably don't contract; instead they might relax or perhaps even assist in exhalation by compressing the chest when needed. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,62.74115990000428,0.021979593658833823,0.006453661261705352,0.0,0.0,0.0
79,<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether runs in Gin Rummy need to consist of the same suit. I remember that in Gin Rummy a run is a sequence of three or more consecutive numbers in the same suit. But wait does that mean all the cards have to be from one suit? Let me think.  I know that in Gin Rummy you can have either a run or a pair as your discard pile. A run requires at least three consecutive cards and they must all be of the same suit. For example if I have 5♠ 6♠ and 7♠ that's a valid run because they're consecutive and all spades.  But what about mixing suits? Suppose I have 5♠ 6♥ and 7♦. Are those considered a run? No because each card is from a different suit. The rules specify that the run must be in the same suit so mixing suits wouldn't work.  I also recall that sometimes players might try to make runs with mixed suits but according to the standard rules of Gin Rummy that's not allowed. Each card in the run has to belong to the same suit for it to count as a valid run.  So putting it all together yes runs must be the same suit in Gin Rummy. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,59.56291959999362,0.020862503197430254,0.006125660501159751,0.0,0.0,0.0

Maybe they're just different names for the same animal? But wait could there be differences I'm not aware of? I should check if their scientific names are the same because sometimes common names can vary even if the species is identical.  I think the scientific name for a cougar is Puma concolor. Does mountain lion have a different scientific name? Or is it also called Puma concolor? If they share the same scientific classification that would suggest they're the same animal. Also I've heard that in some regions ""mountain lion"" is more commonly used while in others ""cougar"" is preferred.  Are there any subspecies or variations between them? Or are they just regional names for the same big cat? I don't recall hearing about different subspecies when it comes to cougars and mountain lions. It seems like they're interchangeable terms depending on where you are geographically.  I should also consider if there's any difference in behavior or habitat that might make them distinct but from what I know both terms refer to the same large solitary cat found in various parts of North America. So putting it all together it seems like cougar and mountain lion are just different names for the same animal. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,55.45468680001795,0.019416940799127817,0.005701213616649089,0.0,0.0,0.0
81,<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether I need a visa to visit Oman. Let me think through this step by step.  First I know that visa requirements can vary depending on where you're coming from and how long you plan to stay. So if someone is asking this question they might be planning a trip and want to make sure they have the right documents.  I remember hearing that some countries offer visa-free entry for certain nationalities but others require a proper visa application. Oman is in the Middle East and I think their visa policies can be a bit strict. Maybe it's similar to other Gulf countries like UAE or Saudi Arabia.  Let me consider if there are any exceptions. Sometimes people with valid residency in neighboring countries might not need a visa for short visits. But that's probably not relevant here unless the traveler has such status.  I should also think about whether Oman offers e-visas or requires applying at an embassy. From what I recall many countries require you to apply for a visa before traveling especially if you're visiting for tourism or business purposes.  Another point is the duration of stay. If someone plans to stay for a few days maybe they can get a tourist visa. But without a proper visa entering Oman might be denied at the border.  I don't think there's a general rule that everyone needs a visa but in most cases especially for tourists and short-term visitors a visa is required. So unless the traveler has a specific agreement or falls under a visa-exempt category they would need to apply for one. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,58.404421099985484,0.020464035649590786,0.006008662224601314,0.0,0.0,0.0

Comcast is a well-known name in the media and entertainment industry. They provide services like cable television internet and phone services. I remember hearing that they own several channels maybe even some sports networks or other content platforms.  Time Warner on the other hand was another major player. I think they used to own big media properties like HBO CNN and Warner Bros. which is a big movie studio. But wait didn't something happen where Time Warner merged with another company? Oh right I believe it was AT&T that bought Time Warner a few years back. So now Time Warner isn't an independent entity anymore; it's part of AT&T.  So if Comcast and Time Warner were separate before any mergers they weren't the same. But after Time Warner merged with AT&T does that make them related to Comcast? I don't think so because Comcast operates independently as a different company. They have their own services and ownerships like NBCUniversal which includes channels such as MSNBC and others.  Therefore even though both companies are in the media sector they aren't the same entity. Comcast is its own separate company while Time Warner has been integrated into AT&T's structure. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,53.18937120004557,0.018630153112269482,0.005470196551698772,0.0,0.0,0.0
83,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Falkland Islands are part of the Commonwealth. Let me start by recalling what the Commonwealth is. The Commonwealth is a political association of member states almost all of which were former territories of the British Empire. It includes countries like Canada Australia India and many others. Membership usually involves some form of constitutional monarchy with the British monarch as head of state.  Now the Falkland Islands are a British Overseas Territory (BOT). I remember that there's a difference between being part of the Commonwealth and just being a territory under the UK. For example places like Gibraltar or the Cayman Islands are also BOTs but not necessarily part of the Commonwealth.  I think the Falklands have their own government with a Governor appointed by the Queen similar to other British Overseas Territories. They might have some autonomy in local governance but still fall under the UK's sovereignty. I'm trying to recall if they participate in the Commonwealth as members or just as territories.  Wait I think that only independent nations can be part of the Commonwealth. The Falklands are not an independent country; they're a British Overseas Territory. So while they have some self-governance they don't hold full sovereignty. Therefore they wouldn't be members of the Commonwealth in the same way as other countries.  I should also consider if there's any special status for the Falklands within the Commonwealth. Maybe through representation or some form of association but I'm not sure. From what I know membership requires a country to have its own government and be independent. Since the Falklands are under British rule they don't meet that criteria.  So putting it all together the Falkland Islands are part of the UK's territories and not independent nations so they aren't members of the Commonwealth. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,55.24042200000258,0.019357598913724034,0.005683789617235294,0.0,0.0,0.0
84,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's peanut butter in Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Let me think about this step by step.  First I know that Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are a popular candy. They're made by Hershey's right? The name itself has ""peanut butter"" in it which might make someone think that the filling is indeed peanut butter. But sometimes companies use similar-sounding ingredients for marketing purposes.  I remember hearing somewhere that Reese's uses something else inside instead of actual peanut butter. Maybe it's a different kind of spread or paste. I think it's called a ""peanut-flavored"" substance but I'm not entirely sure what that means exactly. It could be a mix of peanuts and other ingredients to create the flavor without using traditional peanut butter.  I should consider why they might do this. Peanut butter can be expensive so maybe using an alternative is more cost-effective. Also maybe it's easier to work with in terms of texture or shelf life. I've also heard that some food companies use hydrogenated oils or other ingredients to create a creamy texture similar to peanut butter but at a lower cost.  To confirm this I could look up the official ingredient list for Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. If I recall correctly the main ingredients are milk chocolate and a ""peanut-flavored filling."" That suggests that it's not actual peanut butter but something else designed to mimic the taste and texture.  Another angle is to think about how peanut butter is made. It's usually just ground peanuts mixed with oil or other emulsifiers. If Reese's used real peanut butter it might have a different consistency or require more processing. The filling in the cups seems smooth and maybe a bit firmer than typical peanut butter which could indicate a different ingredient.  I also remember seeing commercials where they show the manufacturing process and I think the filling doesn't look like traditional peanut butter—it's more of a processed paste. That supports the idea that it's not real peanut butter but an alternative.  So putting this all together while the name suggests peanut butter the actual product likely uses a different ingredient to create the flavor and texture without using real peanut butter. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,59.83331869999529,0.02096857876702644,0.006156806472506728,0.0,0.0,0.0
85,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Murphy Brown had a baby on the show. I'm not super familiar with all the details of the show but I remember that Murphy Brown is a character from a sitcom. Let me think about what I know.  Murphy Brown was played by Candice Bergen in the TV series ""The New York Times"" and later in her own show called "" Murphy Brown."" The original show ran for several seasons and there were some spin-offs or related shows as well. From what I recall Murphy Brown is a journalist so her personal life might have been part of the plot.  I think at one point she had a baby. Maybe it was during her relationship with someone like Corky or another character. I'm not entirely sure about the exact episode or season where this happened but I believe there was an arc where she became pregnant and gave birth. I remember something about her having a child perhaps named Eliza or something similar.  Wait wasn't there a storyline where she had a baby with someone? Maybe it was after she separated from her husband or during a relationship with another character. I think the show tackled various aspects of her life including her career and personal relationships so having a child would fit into that narrative.  I'm trying to recall if there were any specific episodes centered around her pregnancy and the arrival of the baby. I believe there was an episode where she went into labor or something like that. So putting this together it seems likely that Murphy Brown did have a baby on the show as part of her character development. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,55.47102029999951,0.019446301378317335,0.005709834487238317,0.0,0.0,0.0
86,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether a quarter pounder actually weighs a quarter of a pound. Hmm let's break this down.  First the term ""quarter pounder"" is commonly used for hamburgers right? Like in fast food places they sell a quarter pounder burger. So does that mean the burger itself weighs exactly a quarter of a pound?  Well I know that a quarter of a pound is 0.25 pounds. But when you order a burger it's not just the meat patty; there are buns toppings and other stuff on it. So if they call it a ""quarter pounder "" does that refer only to the weight of the patty or the total weight of the entire burger?  I think in most cases when they say quarter pounder they're talking about the meat portion. For example McDonald's Big Mac has two patties each a quarter pound so together it's half a pound. But wait that's for two patties. So if one patty is a quarter pound then yes it would weigh 0.25 pounds.  But sometimes the term might be used to describe the total weight of the burger including everything else. If that's the case then the entire burger would weigh more than a quarter pound because of the bun and toppings.  So if the question is about whether the quarter pounder weighs exactly a quarter of a pound it depends on what part they're referring to. If it's just the patty then yes. But if it's the whole burger then no.  But in common usage when someone orders a quarter pounder are they talking about the total weight or just the meat? I think it's usually the meat. So in that case the answer would be true because the patty itself is a quarter of a pound.  Wait but sometimes places might market it as the total burger being a quarter pound which could be misleading. But generally I think they specify if it's the patty or the whole burger. So assuming it refers to the patty then yes it weighs a quarter pound. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,61.983936799981166,0.021725454210893322,0.00637904068701672,0.0,0.0,0.0
87,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the US has ever won the World Cup in soccer. Let me start by recalling what I know about the FIFA World Cup. The World Cup is a major international football tournament held every four years and it's considered one of the most prestigious events in sports.  I remember that the US has had some success in different tournaments but I'm not sure about the World Cup specifically. I think the men's national team has made several appearances but hasn't won the title yet. Wait wasn't there a time when they came close? Maybe in 2014 or 2018?  I also recall that the US women's soccer team is much more successful. They've won multiple World Cup titles including recent ones. But the question is about the men's team I think. So focusing on the men's side have they ever lifted the trophy? From what I can remember no they haven't.  I should double-check some facts. The US men's national team has participated in several World Cups but hasn't reached the final since 1950 where they actually did win. Wait that was a surprise because they were underdogs and defeated England in the group stage. But after that they didn't go far in later tournaments.  In more recent times like the 2014 World Cup in Brazil the US team had some memorable matches but didn't advance beyond the knockout stages. They lost to Germany in the quarterfinals. So no victory there either.  Considering all this it seems that the US men's national team has never won a FIFA World Cup title. Their best performance was in 1950 when they surprisingly won their group and advanced to the final but I think they didn't actually win the tournament because the finals were between the top two teams from each group which might have been different back then.  Wait no in 1950 the US did defeat England and Chile in the group stage and then played against Brazil in the final match. They lost that game 2-1 so they didn't win the World Cup. Therefore the US men's team has never won a World Cup.  So putting it all together the answer should be False because the US hasn't won the FIFA World Cup in soccer. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,62.86950240001897,0.022043728165593007,0.006472492473429959,0.0,0.0,0.0
88,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Illinois has a ""stand your ground"" law. First I should understand what a ""stand your ground"" law actually means. From what I know these laws allow people to use force including deadly force to defend themselves without needing to retreat or escape the situation first. It's different from other self-defense laws that might require someone to try and get away before using force.  Now I'm trying to recall if Illinois has such a law. I think some states do but others don't. Maybe it was passed recently? Or perhaps they have something similar but not exactly called ""stand your ground."" I should check the legal definitions in Illinois.  I remember hearing that Illinois had some changes in their self-defense laws. There's something about allowing defense of property as well which might be part of it. But does that fall under a stand your ground law? Or is it a separate provision?  Wait I think there was a case where someone defended themselves without retreating and the courts allowed it. That might indicate that Illinois recognizes such a principle. However I'm not entirely sure if it's codified as an explicit ""stand your ground"" statute or just part of their broader self-defense laws.  I should also consider whether Illinois has specific exceptions or limitations to this law. For example does it apply everywhere including one's home business or car? Or are there places where you can't claim stand your ground?  Another point is the duty to retreat. If Illinois requires people to try and escape before using force then they don't have a traditional stand your ground law. But if they allow for immediate defense without retreat that would align with having such a law.  I think I've heard that Illinois allows for self-defense in one's home without needing to retreat which is sometimes referred to as the ""Castle Doctrine."" That might be conflated with stand your ground laws but they're not exactly the same. The Castle Doctrine typically applies to one's residence while stand your ground can apply anywhere.  So putting this together Illinois does have provisions that allow for self-defense without retreat in certain situations particularly in one's home or business. However whether it's explicitly called a ""stand your ground"" law might depend on the specific statute and how it's defined. Some sources might refer to these provisions as stand your ground laws while others differentiate between them.  I should also check if there have been any recent legislative changes. Maybe Illinois updated their laws recently to include more explicit stand your ground provisions. Alternatively they might not use that exact terminology but have similar legal principles in place.  In summary after considering the definitions and what I know about Illinois' self-defense laws it seems likely that Illinois does have a form of stand your ground law particularly when defending one's home or property without needing to retreat. However the specifics might vary so relying on official statutes would be more accurate. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,64.18461920000846,0.022501925313780168,0.006607028590492836,0.0,0.0,0.0
89,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""fitness"" as used in biology and ""survival"" mean the same thing. Let me start by understanding each term individually.  In biology when we talk about fitness it's usually referred to as ""biological fitness."" From what I remember biological fitness refers to an organism's ability to survive and reproduce successfully in its environment. It's a measure of how well an organism can pass on its genes to the next generation. So higher fitness means better chances of survival and reproduction.  On the other hand survival is pretty straightforward—it just means staying alive. But in biology especially when discussing evolution survival alone isn't enough; it's about passing on those traits that contribute to survival. So while survival is a part of fitness fitness also includes reproductive success.  I think they're related but not exactly the same. Fitness encompasses both surviving and reproducing whereas survival is just about staying alive. For example an organism might survive but not reproduce which wouldn't improve its fitness because it's not passing on its genes.  So putting it together while survival contributes to fitness they aren't identical concepts. Fitness is a broader term that includes both survival and reproduction. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,60.5763711000036,0.02123773736887099,0.006235836980028454,0.0,0.0,0.0
90,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Civil Rights Act is in the Constitution. Let me start by recalling what I know about both documents.  The U.S. Constitution is the foundational law of the country outlining the structure of the government and the basic principles of law. It includes amendments that have been added over time to address various issues such as slavery voting rights and equality.  The Civil Rights Act on the other hand refers to several pieces of legislation aimed at combating discrimination based on race color religion sex or national origin. The most notable ones are the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 1870 1875 and the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964.  I remember that the Constitution doesn't list specific laws like the Civil Rights Act; instead it provides the framework for creating such laws. The actual acts are passed by Congress and signed into law which makes them part of statutory law rather than constitutional law.  Additionally some key parts of the Constitution like the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments have been instrumental in supporting civil rights legislation. For example the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause has been used to challenge discriminatory laws under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  So putting this together while the Constitution provides the basis for civil rights protections the specific provisions of the Civil Rights Acts are not found directly in the Constitution itself but rather in separate statutes passed by Congress. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,61.53811940000742,0.021571582723458268,0.006333860850066392,0.0,0.0,0.0
91,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Britain has the right to bear arms. Hmm I'm not entirely sure about this but I'll try to break it down.  First I know that the UK is a country with its own set of laws regarding firearms. I remember hearing that gun control in the UK is quite strict compared to places like the United States. But wait does that mean they don't have any right to bear arms at all?  I think about the legal framework. In the US there's the Second Amendment which talks about bearing arms but Britain doesn't have a similar amendment. Instead their laws are based on different statutes and regulations. So maybe in the UK the right isn't as explicitly stated.  I also recall that after some tragic events like school shootings or terrorist attacks the UK has implemented stricter gun laws. For example there were bans on certain types of firearms. So perhaps the right to bear arms is more restricted there.  But wait do they have any rights at all? I think even in the UK people can own guns for specific reasons like sports shooting or hunting but it's heavily regulated. You need licenses and pass background checks. So maybe the right exists but is tightly controlled.  I'm trying to remember if there was a recent case where someone tried to challenge the gun laws in the UK courts. I think there have been cases but they usually don't succeed because the laws are seen as necessary for public safety.  So putting it all together Britain doesn't have an explicit constitutional right like the Second Amendment in the US. Instead their firearms policies are based on statutes that heavily regulate gun ownership. Therefore while individuals can apply for licenses to own guns under strict conditions there isn't a broad unrestricted right to bear arms as exists in some other countries. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,64.40690580001683,0.02257591448315441,0.006628753334070359,0.0,0.0,0.0
92,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if thread seal tape and Teflon tape are the same thing. Let me start by breaking down what each of these terms means.  Thread seal tape sounds like it's used for sealing threads. Threads are those spiral ridges on screws or bolts that help hold things together. So thread seal tape is probably something you wrap around a threaded area to make sure nothing leaks or escapes. I've heard of using PTFE tape for this purpose before which brings me to the next term: Teflon tape.  Teflon is a brand name for polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) a material known for its non-stick properties and resistance to heat and chemicals. So Teflon tape would be made from PTFE. It's often used in plumbing to seal threaded connections because it doesn't stick to metals and can handle high temperatures.  Now are these two tapes the same? Well thread seal tape is a category of products designed for sealing threads which could include various materials like Teflon. But not all thread seal tapes are made from Teflon. There might be other types as well such as PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) tape or even rubber-based tapes.  So while Teflon tape is a specific type of thread seal tape they aren't exactly the same because thread seal tape can refer to different materials depending on the application. Therefore it's not accurate to say they are identical; rather Teflon tape falls under the broader category of thread seal tapes. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,63.7209589999984,0.02233801557562413,0.006558901316441584,0.0,0.0,0.0
93,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Hawaii was ever called the Sandwich Islands. Hmm I've heard that term before but I'm not exactly sure about its origin or if it's related to Hawaii.  First I remember that the Sandwich Islands is a historical name for somewhere in the Pacific. Maybe it's a place that's now known by another name. I think it might be associated with Hawaii because I recall hearing that Hawaii was once called the Sandwich Islands but I'm not 100% certain.  Wait let me break this down. The Sandwich Islands—where did that name come from? It probably comes from a historical figure or an explorer who named them. Maybe Captain Cook? He explored the Pacific and encountered many islands. I think he was involved in naming some places.  I also remember that Hawaii is a group of islands so it's possible that ""Sandwich Islands"" refers to Hawaii. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively maybe the Sandwich Islands refer to another archipelago like the ones near New Zealand or somewhere else in the Pacific.  Let me think about other sources. I've heard of the term ""Sandwich Islands"" used in historical contexts perhaps in literature or old maps. Maybe it was a former name that's not commonly used anymore. So if Hawaii was once called the Sandwich Islands then the answer would be True. But if it refers to another set of islands then False.  I should also consider the timeline. When were the Sandwich Islands referred to by that name? If it was before Hawaii became a territory or a state maybe during the 18th or early 19th century then it's possible. Captain Cook named many places during his voyages so perhaps he called Hawaii the Sandwich Islands.  Wait I think I've read somewhere that after Captain Cook's third voyage in 1778 he named the Hawaiian Islands the Sandwich Islands in honor of the Earl of Sandwich who was a patron or sponsor of his voyages. So that would mean that historically Hawaii was known as the Sandwich Islands before it became known as the Sandwich Islands.  But I'm not entirely sure if this is accurate. Maybe there's confusion between different island groups. For example the Philippines were once called the Spanish East Indies but that's a different case.  Alternatively maybe the term ""Sandwich Islands"" refers to the group of islands near New Zealand which are now known as the Cook Islands or part of French Polynesia. But I'm not certain about that either.  To clarify I think it's more likely that Hawaii was once called the Sandwich Islands because of Captain Cook's naming during his exploration. Therefore the answer would be True. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,62.89987230001134,0.022057221970714823,0.0064764545324534056,0.0,0.0,0.0
94,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if ""The Tale of Despereaux"" is a Disney movie. Let me start by recalling what I know about this story. I remember that it's an animated film but I'm not sure who produced it. The title sounds familiar maybe from some children's book? Wait wasn't there a book called ""The Tale of Despereaux"" by Kate DiCamillo? Yes I think so. That was turned into a movie.  Now Disney has produced many animated films over the years like ""Snow White "" ""Cinderella "" and more recently ""Zootopia."" But not every animated film is a Disney production. There are other studios too like DreamWorks Pixar and Blue Sky Studios.  I think ""The Tale of Despereaux"" was released in 2006. Let me try to remember the studio behind it. I believe it was produced by Universal Pictures. Wait no maybe it's a different company. Alternatively could it be that it's an independent production or perhaps associated with another well-known studio?  I recall that ""The Tale of Despereaux"" had some unique animation style and was directed by someone like Mark Osborne who later worked on ""Kubo and the Two Strings."" If I'm not mistaken this movie wasn't produced by Disney. Instead it might have been a collaboration between different studios or perhaps an independent project.  Another way to check is to think about other movies from that time period. In 2006 Disney had films like ""Cars"" and ""The Princess and the Frog"" later on but I don't remember them releasing ""Despereaux."" It's more likely that it was produced by a different studio aiming for a similar target audience.  So putting this together I think ""The Tale of Despereaux"" is not a Disney movie. It was made by another studio possibly Universal or another production company. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,65.08944019998307,0.022827791176777447,0.006702709517500898,0.0,0.0,0.0
95,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether a batter gets a RBI on a fielder's choice. Hmm let me start by understanding what each term means.  First a ""batter"" is the player who hits the ball. An ""RBI "" or Runs Batted In is when a batter drives in a run usually by hitting a home run double triple or even a single if there are runners on base. Now a ""fielder's choice"" is when a fielder chooses to make an out rather than attempting to put the runner out at another base. This often happens when the fielder can't reach the ball in time so they opt for an easier out.  So does the batter get credit for an RBI if it's a fielder's choice? Well I think RBIs are awarded based on whether the batter's action causes a run to score regardless of how the out was made. If there were runners on base and the batter hits the ball resulting in a fielder's choice that allows those runners to score then yes the batter should get an RBI.  Wait but sometimes in a fielder's choice the runner might be thrown out at the next base instead of scoring. In that case no run would have scored so there wouldn't be an RBI. But if the fielder's choice allows runners to reach home without being thrown out then it counts as an RBI.  I think the key here is whether a run actually scores because of the batter's hit even if it was a fielder's choice. So yes if the result is that a runner crosses the plate the batter gets the RBI. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,64.17719499999657,0.02251057749948752,0.0066095690503664515,0.0,0.0,0.0
96,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the County Court Business Centre is a real court. Hmm let me think about this step by step.  First I know that there are different types of courts in the legal system. There's the County Court which handles civil cases and some family matters. Then there's the High Court which deals with more serious or complex cases. But what exactly is a County Court Business Centre?  I remember hearing about these centres being set up to handle specific kinds of cases more efficiently. Maybe they're like specialized courts within the larger court system. I think they might focus on things like personal injury claims medical negligence or other business-related disputes.  Wait but are they actual courts with judges and courtrooms? Or are they just administrative offices that manage cases without having judicial proceedings on-site? That's a bit confusing. If it's a business centre maybe it's more about managing the logistics of cases rather than being where trials take place.  I should check what functions these centres perform. From what I recall County Court Business Centres are part of the County Court system but they might not have their own courtrooms. Instead they probably handle case management scheduling and other administrative tasks. So while they're an integral part of the court system they aren't where trials or hearings happen.  Therefore if someone is asking whether it's a real court I think the answer would be no because it doesn't conduct trials or have judicial proceedings in its own right. It's more of a support structure within the County Court system. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,66.36626290000277,0.023279732948933176,0.00683540892736172,0.0,0.0,0.0

I remember that the US Mint produces various denominations of coins and paper money. The $2 bill is a less common denomination compared to others like $1 $5 $10 etc. I think they don't print as many $2 bills because they're not used as frequently in daily transactions.  Wait but does that mean they stop producing them entirely? Or do they still make some for specific reasons? Maybe they only produce them when there's a need like for collectors or special occasions.  I should check if the production of $2 bills was ongoing in 2018. I think the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is responsible for printing paper money. They might have stopped regular production years ago but still print some upon request.  So putting it together: The US Mint doesn't regularly produce $2 bills anymore because they're not needed as much. However if there's a specific order or demand like from collectors they might print them. Therefore in 2018 they weren't making regular batches of $2 bills but could still produce them on request. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,61.94859770004405,0.02172209294054693,0.006378053748833906,0.0,0.0,0.0
98,"<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether quantum entanglement can transfer information faster than the speed of light. Hmm I remember that quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become linked and whatever happens to one instantly affects the other no matter how far apart they are. But wait does this actually allow for sending messages or information quickly?  I think Einstein called it ""spooky action at a distance "" which suggests he was skeptical about it being real. But experiments like EPR paradox and Bell tests have shown that entanglement does work as predicted by quantum mechanics. So the particles do seem to be connected instantaneously.  But here's where I'm confused: if the particles are entangled measuring one instantly determines the state of the other. However can you actually use this to send information? Because when you measure an entangled particle you get a random outcome. The randomness means that even though the states are correlated you can't control the outcomes to send specific messages.  So if Alice and Bob share entangled particles any measurement Alice makes will collapse Bob's particle into a corresponding state. But without some way of communicating which outcome she got Bob wouldn't know what his result signifies. He'd just see a random state that could be anything. To make sense of it they would need to compare their results classically like over the phone or another channel which obviously can't go faster than light.  Another point is that information transfer requires some sort of control over the data being sent. Since quantum mechanics doesn't allow you to determine the outcome of a measurement beforehand you can't encode specific messages using entanglement alone. You need additional classical communication to make sense of the results which means no actual faster-than-light signaling.  I've also heard about quantum teleportation where information is transmitted using entangled particles. But in that case the information itself isn't moving faster than light; it's more like a way to create an identical state at a distant location. The process still requires classical communication channels so no superluminal (faster-than-light) information transfer occurs.  So putting this all together: while entanglement allows for instantaneous correlations between particles it doesn't enable the transmission of usable information faster than light because the outcomes are random and require classical communication to interpret. Therefore quantum entanglement cannot be used to send information faster than the speed of light. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,67.894924000022,0.023812501175429077,0.006991840648446889,0.0,0.0,0.0
99,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""World at War"" is part of the Black Ops series. Let me start by recalling what I know about both terms.  First ""Black Ops"" refers to a series of video games developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. The main installments in this series include titles like ""Call of Duty: Black Ops "" ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II "" and ""Call of Duty: Black Ops III."" These are first-person shooter games known for their intense gameplay and historical or near-future settings.  Now ""World at War"" is another title I'm trying to place. I remember that there was a game called ""Call of Duty: World at War "" which was released in 2008. This game is set during World War II and features various campaigns across different theaters of the war including Europe North Africa and the Pacific.  Wait a minute so both ""World at War"" and the Black Ops series are part of the Call of Duty franchise. But they are separate games within that larger universe. The Black Ops games have their own storyline and settings often focusing on modern or near-future conflicts with covert operations as the theme. On the other hand ""World at War"" is firmly set in World War II.  I don't think ""World at War"" is considered part of the Black Ops series because each mainline Call of Duty game has its own distinct storyline and setting. While they share some similarities in gameplay mechanics they are different enough in terms of plot and historical context to be separate entries.  So putting it all together since ""World at War"" is a standalone game within the Call of Duty franchise but not part of the specific Black Ops sub-series the answer should be False. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,63.56763860001229,0.022295840423174722,0.006546517823289067,0.0,0.0,0.0
100,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether tonic water and quinine water are the same thing. Let me start by recalling what I know about each.  Tonic water is something I've heard of before often associated with being a mixer in cocktails like the gin and tonic. It's also known for having a slightly bitter taste which I think comes from some kind of natural or added substance. Quinine water sounds similar because quinine is a word that rings a bell as related to bitterness.  I remember that quinine is derived from the bark of the cinchona tree. It was historically used to treat malaria and also gives tonic water its bitter flavor. So if quinine is in tonic water does that mean they're the same?  Wait but I think there are different types of tonic waters. Some might have added flavors like citrus or sweeteners which could make them distinct from just plain quinine water. Maybe quinine water refers specifically to drinks where quinine is the primary ingredient without additional flavorings.  I should also consider if there's a difference in how they're made or used. Tonic water seems more common as a soft drink or mixer while quinine water might be less processed or more of a natural health tonic. But I'm not entirely sure about that distinction.  Another angle: maybe the terms are sometimes used interchangeably but technically they have different origins or purposes. For example tonic water could be a broader category that includes various types including those with quinine while quinine water is a specific kind of tonic.  I think I've heard that in some countries like Spain quinine water is consumed as a soft drink similar to how tonic is used elsewhere. So maybe they're just regional terms for the same thing or very similar products.  But then again there might be differences in concentration or additional ingredients. Tonic water could have more sugar or other additives whereas quinine water might be purer containing only quinine and perhaps a bit of sugar.  I'm also considering if there's any historical difference. Quinine was used medicinally before being incorporated into beverages for flavor. So maybe quinine water is the original form and tonic water came later as a more commercialized version with added flavors.  In summary while both are flavored waters with bitterness from quinine they might differ in terms of additional ingredients processing or intended use. However in common usage people often refer to them interchangeably especially since many tonic waters still contain quinine. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,71.44104780000634,0.025059197381022424,0.0073578963240903345,0.0,0.0,0.0
101,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if ""corinthian leather"" is a real thing. Hmm I've heard the term before maybe in car commercials or something? Let me think.  First what do I know about Corinthian leather? It sounds fancy right? Maybe it's a type of high-quality leather used for upholstery or something like that. But wait I'm not sure if it's an actual material or just a marketing term.  I remember hearing the phrase ""Corinthian leather"" in car ads especially from brands like Cadillac or Mercedes-Benz. They often use fancy terms to describe their interiors. So maybe it's a specific type of leather they use. But is it a real thing or just a name they made up?  Let me break it down. The word ""leather"" part is clear—it refers to animal hide processed into a material. But ""Corinthian"" is the tricky part. Corinth is an ancient city in Greece so maybe it's referencing something historical or luxurious.  I think some luxury car brands use terms like ""Nappa leather"" or ""猄皮"" which are specific types of leather. So perhaps ""Corinthian leather"" is another term they use for a premium leather. But I'm not sure if it's standardized or just a brand-specific name.  Wait maybe it's similar to ""Alcantara "" which is a synthetic material often used in cars and called suede-like. But no Alcantara isn't leather. So back to Corinthian—maybe it's a type of full-grain leather? Or perhaps it's treated in a special way to make it softer or more durable.  I should check if there are any official sources that mention ""Corinthian leather."" Maybe looking up car manufacturer websites or upholstery suppliers could help. If multiple brands use the term it might be an actual type of leather. But if only one brand uses it it's probably a marketing term.  Another angle: maybe it's named after Corinth because of some historical connection. Like perhaps it's a traditional leather from that region but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively it could be a made-up name to evoke luxury and heritage.  I think the key here is whether ""Corinthian leather"" is recognized in the industry or if it's just a brand's proprietary term. If it's widely used across different manufacturers then it exists as a real product. Otherwise it might not be an actual type of leather but rather a marketing buzzword.  So putting it all together: I'm leaning towards ""Corinthian leather"" being a specific high-quality leather used by certain brands especially in automotive interiors. It's probably a real material albeit maybe not as commonly known or standardized across the board. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,68.04562650001026,0.02386178079572097,0.0070063101596401275,0.0,0.0,0.0
103,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether there's a playoff for third place in the World Cup. Hmm I'm not entirely sure about this but I think I remember something about it from watching soccer before.  I know that in tournaments like the FIFA World Cup teams compete in groups and then move on to knockout stages. The final is obviously the biggest game determining who wins the championship. But what happens with the other teams? There's a semifinal right? So after the semifinals there are two teams that go to the final but what about the other two?  I think those two losing semifinalists play each other for third place. That makes sense because it gives them another chance to compete and maybe get some recognition. I've seen highlights where a bronze medal ceremony happens which would be awarded after that third-place playoff.  Wait is this always the case? Does every World Cup have a third-place game? From what I recall yes they do. It's part of the tradition. The third-place match is usually between the two teams that lost in the semifinals. This way even though they didn't make it to the final they can still earn some honor and recognition.  I don't think there have been any recent changes to this format. FIFA has been organizing the World Cup for a long time and I believe the structure remains consistent. So putting it all together yes there is indeed a playoff for third place in the World Cup. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,66.06386100000236,0.023171186560627225,0.006803537472766988,0.0,0.0,0.0
104,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the statement ""is there no sales tax in new hampshire"" is true or false. Let me start by recalling what I know about sales taxes in different states.  I remember that some states have no sales tax but I'm not exactly sure which ones. I think it's a few maybe like Alaska Delaware Montana New Hampshire and Oregon? Wait was that right? I've heard before that New Hampshire is one of them. So if the statement says there's no sales tax in New Hampshire that would be true.  But wait let me make sure. Sometimes states have other taxes or fees instead. Does New Hampshire charge any kind of tax on goods and services? From what I recall they don't have a state-level sales tax but maybe localities do? Or perhaps there are exceptions for certain items?  I should also consider if the statement is about the entire state or just specific areas. The question seems to be general so it's probably referring to the state as a whole. If New Hampshire doesn't impose a sales tax at the state level and most localities don't either then the answer would be true.  But I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should think about why some states have no sales tax. It might be related to their revenue structure relying more on other taxes like income or property taxes instead. New Hampshire is known for being a low-tax state so that aligns with the idea of having no sales tax.  I don't recall any major changes in recent years regarding sales tax in New Hampshire. So it's likely still the case that they don't have one. Therefore the statement should be true. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,72.24368069999036,0.02533868976773204,0.007439961043622785,0.0,0.0,0.0
105,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether San Luis Rey de Francia was always a mission. Hmm let's break this down.  First I know that ""San Luis Rey de Francia"" refers to Mission San Luis Rey in California. It's one of the missions established by the Spanish during their colonization of the area. But wait were there other uses for it after the mission period?  I remember that missions in California had a specific purpose: they were religious outposts meant to convert Native Americans and support agriculture and ranching. However after Mexican independence from Spain in 1821 the missions started to lose their control over lands and indigenous people. The secularization acts of the 1830s led to the transfer of mission properties to private individuals.  So Mission San Luis Rey was probably secularized at some point. That means it stopped functioning as a mission and became something else maybe a parish church or part of a private estate. Therefore it wasn't always a mission; after the mid-19th century its role changed.  I should also consider if there were any periods before or after when it was used differently. But I think once the missions were secularized they became more like local churches rather than active missionary outposts. So yes San Luis Rey de Francia wasn't always a mission—it transitioned into another form. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,71.54617770004552,0.025109109051064463,0.0073725514181042255,0.0,0.0,0.0
102,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if any of the original members of Lynyrd Skynyrd are still alive. First I should probably recall who the original members were. Lynyrd Skynyrd is a rock band from the 80s right? They had some famous songs like ""Free Bird"" and ""Tombstone Blues.""   I think the main members included lead vocalist Ronnie Van Zant guitarist Gary Rossington bassist Leon Wilkeson drummer Billy Powell and another guitarist named Steve Gaines. There was also a keyboard player I believe his name was Bob Burns.  Now I remember hearing that there was a tragic plane crash involving some of the band members. Let me think... wasn't it in 1977? Yes that's right. The plane crashed shortly after takeoff and several people were killed including Ronnie Van Zant Steve Gaines his wife and others.  So if I'm correct most of the original members died in that crash. But wait there might have been some survivors or maybe other band members who weren't on that flight. Let me think about each member:  - Ronnie Van Zant: He was on the plane and died. - Gary Rossington: I think he survived because I've heard him still playing with Lynyrd Skynyrd in later years but wait no wasn't he also on the plane? Or did he survive? Wait maybe I'm confusing him with someone else. Let me check my memory again.  I believe that after the crash the band reformed with new members because many of the original ones were lost. So perhaps some survived but not all. For example Billy Powell was on the plane and died right? Leon Wilkeson might have been on the flight as well. Steve Gaines and his wife were also killed.  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me try to list each member:  1. Ronnie Van Zant - Lead vocals died in crash. 2. Gary Rossington - Guitarist was he on the plane? Or did he survive? 3. Leon Wilkeson - Bassist possibly on the plane. 4. Billy Powell - Drummer on the plane and died. 5. Steve Gaines - Guitars on the plane and died. 6. Bob Burns - Keyboards I think he wasn't on the flight.  Wait so if Bob Burns wasn't on the plane maybe he survived. But was he part of the original lineup? Or did he join later?  I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should consider that some sources say that after the crash the band continued with new members but perhaps one or two original members survived.  Alternatively perhaps all the original members were on the plane except for someone like Bob Burns who wasn't part of the core group at the time.  Wait another thought: Lynyrd Skynyrd had a line-up that included both original and later members. The crash killed several key members but maybe some survived. For example I think that after the crash the band continued with new singers and other members so perhaps only one or two of the original members are still alive.  But to be precise I should probably recall which members were on the plane. From what I remember Ronnie Van Zant Steve Gaines his wife and others died but maybe Gary Rossington survived because he wasn't on that flight? Or was he?  Wait no I think Gary Rossington was also on the plane. So if that's the case then perhaps none of the original members are alive anymore.  But wait I'm not entirely certain about this. Maybe some sources say that one or two survived. Alternatively maybe the crash didn't take all of them but most.  Wait another angle: Lynyrd Skynyrd had a line-up change over time so perhaps only a few original members are still alive. For example if Bob Burns wasn't on the flight he might be alive today.  But I'm not sure about his status. Alternatively maybe someone like Michael Lee or others survived but they weren't part of the original lineup.  Wait no the original members were Van Zant Rossington Wilkeson Powell Gaines and Burns. If most died in the crash then perhaps only one or two survived.  But I'm getting stuck here because my memory is a bit fuzzy on who exactly was on the plane. To be thorough I should probably think about each member:  - Ronnie Van Zant: Died. - Gary Rossington: On the plane? Or not? Wait no I think Gary Rossington wasn't on that particular flight. Because after the crash he continued with the band in later years.  Wait that makes more sense. So if Gary Rossington survived then yes he's still alive today. But was he part of the original members?  Yes Gary Rossington was one of the founding members so if he survived then at least one original member is alive.  But I'm not entirely sure about this because sometimes sources say that he wasn't on the flight. Let me try to confirm in my mind: The crash happened in 1977 and after that Lynyrd Skynyrd reformed with Gary Rossington as a guitarist so perhaps he was not on the plane.  Therefore if Gary Rossington is still alive then yes at least one original member is alive. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,87.12824180000462,0.03057659680186881,0.00897791839821821,0.0,0.0,0.0
106,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there will be a Season 4 of Total Bellas. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about the show. Total Bellas is a reality TV series that follows the Bella Twins Brie and Nikki Bella as they navigate their lives relationships and careers in the wrestling industry. It's produced by WWE.  I remember hearing that the show had several seasons but I'm not exactly sure how many. Let me think... Season 1 was in 2016 then there were a few more seasons after that. I believe it went up to Season 3 or maybe even further. Wait no I think they stopped after a certain point.  I should check when the last season was released. If I recall correctly the show had its last episode around 2019 or early 2020. Since then there hasn't been any official announcement from WWE about a new season. Sometimes TV shows get renewed based on ratings and fan reception but if it's been quiet for a few years that might indicate they're not planning another season.  Also considering the personal lives of Brie and Nikki Bella I think they've moved on to other projects. Brie is involved in various wrestling commentating roles and Nikki has her own business ventures. Their focus might be elsewhere now which could mean there's less incentive for them to continue with the show.  Moreover WWE tends to focus a lot on their main events and pay-per-views so maybe they've shifted their resources away from reality TV towards other content. The wrestling landscape is always changing and perhaps WWE has newer priorities that don't include producing another season of Total Bellas.  I should also consider if there's any recent news or announcements regarding the show's renewal. If I can't find any information about it that might suggest that plans for a Season 4 aren't in place. Sometimes shows get canceled without much notice especially if ratings drop or production costs become an issue.  In summary based on the last season being around 2019-2020 and no recent updates from WWE along with the Bellas' current activities it seems unlikely that there will be a Season 4 of Total Bellas. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,73.96263490000274,0.02597186670242605,0.007625874828866843,0.0,0.0,0.0
107,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Kristen Bell sang all the voices of Anna. Hmm let's break this down.  First I know that Kristen Bell is an actress and singer. She's famous for her role as Annabeth in Percy Jackson movies and also for being part of the D20 initiative supporting women in Hollywood. But wait the question is about ""Anna."" Oh right! Anna from Frozen. Wait no Frozen stars Elsa and Anna but I think Kristen Bell isn't the voice of Anna.  Wait actually in Frozen the voices are done by different people. Let me recall: Elsa is voiced by Idina Menzel who's a Broadway singer. Then Anna... wasn't she voiced by someone else? Oh right it was Kristin Bell but wait no—Kristen Bell is an actress and I think her voice might not be the one for Anna.  Wait maybe I'm confusing with another character. Let me think: Frozen's Anna is a young woman so they probably used a younger-sounding voice. I believe it was actually Kristin Bell's sister but no that doesn't sound right. Wait no—Kristen Bell did provide the singing voice for Anna in some parts but not all.  Wait no I think I'm mixing things up. Let me check: In Frozen the main voices are done by different people. Idina Menzel is Elsa and for Anna they used a different actress. Oh wait it's actually Kristin Bell who did Anna's singing? Or was it someone else?  Wait no—Kristen Bell is known for her acting roles but I think she also has a singing career. But in Frozen the voice of Anna is done by another actress. Let me try to remember: I believe it's actually Kristin Bell's sister who did Anna's speaking and singing parts. Or was it someone else entirely?  Wait no—I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about this differently. The question is whether Kristen Bell sang all the voices of Anna. So if Anna in Frozen has both speaking and singing parts did Kristen Bell do all of them? Or did she only do some?  I think Idina Menzel did Elsa's singing but for Anna it was a different singer. I believe it was actually Kristin Bell who provided the singing voice for Anna but maybe not her speaking voice. Wait no—Kristen Bell is an actress and singer so perhaps she did both.  Wait now I'm getting more confused. Let me try to recall: In Frozen the character Anna has both dialogue and songs. The main song ""Let It Go"" is by Idina Menzel as Elsa but Anna's songs are different. I think Kristin Bell provided the singing voice for Anna in some parts but maybe not all.  Wait no—I'm mixing up things again. Maybe it's better to look this up mentally: Kristen Bell is known for her role as Elizabeth Hurley in The CW's series but that's acting. For Frozen I think the voice of Anna was done by a different actress. Wait actually I believe it's Kristin Bell who did both the speaking and singing for Anna.  Wait no—I'm getting this wrong because I'm confusing her with another actress. Let me try to remember: In Frozen the voices are:  - Elsa: Idina Menzel - Anna: ?  I think Anna was voiced by a different person. Maybe it's someone like Kristin Bell's sister or another actress. Wait no—I think it's actually Kristin Bell who did Anna's singing parts because she has a similar voice.  Wait I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall the credits: Frozen's Anna is voiced by... I believe it's actually Kristin Bell who provided the singing for Anna but maybe not all of her lines. Or perhaps she did both.  Alternatively maybe it's another actress entirely. Wait no—I think I'm mixing up with other Disney characters. Let me try to remember: In Frozen the voice of Anna is done by a different person because Kristen Bell was busy or unavailable. So the answer would be False because she didn't sing all the voices.  Wait but I'm not sure. Maybe I should conclude that she did do it. No wait—I think it's actually her sister who did the singing for Anna. Or perhaps another actress altogether. Therefore the answer is False. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,87.41131669998867,0.03069460233109223,0.009012567251351588,0.0,0.0,0.0
108,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's going to be a 14th season of Grey's Anatomy. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. Grey's Anatomy has been around for quite some time now—since 2005 right? That makes it over 17 years already. It's one of those long-running medical dramas that have a strong fan base.  I remember hearing that the show was renewed for its 15th season recently. I think that happened in early 2023 or so. So if there's been a 15th season then logically the 14th must have come before that. That makes sense because each new season is usually announced after the previous one has wrapped up.  But wait sometimes shows announce multiple seasons at once to give fans more to look forward to. I'm not sure if they did that here. Let me think—when was the 15th season announced? If it was just for one more season then the 14th would have been confirmed before or around the same time.  I should also consider the show's popularity and ratings. Grey's Anatomy has consistently been a hit so it makes sense that they keep renewing it. The network probably sees good returns on investment which keeps the show alive.  Another angle is the creative team and the actors' commitments. If the main cast or key writers were leaving that might affect future seasons. But as far as I know most of the main cast has stayed on board so there's no major issue there.  I also recall some spin-offs from Grey's Anatomy like Station 19 and The实习医生格蕾德斯 but those don't necessarily impact the main series' continuation. They're separate shows that might have their own renewals or cancellations.  So putting it all together: the show was renewed for season 15 which would mean season 14 has already been confirmed. Therefore yes there is going to be a 14th season. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,78.19589520001318,0.027479154237213282,0.008068445484380219,0.0,0.0,0.0
109,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the October Revolution is the same as the Bolshevik Revolution. Let me start by recalling what each of these terms refers to.  The October Revolution—I remember it was a significant event in Russian history. It happened in 1917 right? I think it's also known as the Bolshevik Revolution because the Bolsheviks were the group that led it. The Bolsheviks were a Marxist party led by Lenin. They overthrew the provisional government that had been in place after the February Revolution earlier that year.  Wait so the October Revolution was specifically the event where the Bolsheviks seized power. So is the October Revolution another name for the same event as the Bolshevik Revolution? It seems like it because both terms refer to the same historical occurrence where the Bolshevik Party took control.  I should also consider if there are any differences in how these terms are used. Sometimes people might use ""Bolshevik Revolution"" to refer more broadly to the revolutionary activities led by that party but I think in most cases especially when specifying October 1917 it's the same event.  So putting it together: The October Revolution is another name for the Bolshevik Revolution because they both describe the successful seizure of power by the Bolsheviks in Russia in October 1917. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,80.43662039999617,0.02826234187022527,0.008298405499395544,0.0,0.0,0.0
110,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the heat from a hair dryer can kill lice. Hmm I remember that lice are those tiny parasites that live in hair and feed on blood. They're pretty common especially among kids. Now I've heard of different methods to get rid of them—like using special shampoos combs or even natural remedies.  But the question is about using a hair dryer's heat. Does it work? Well lice have bodies that can withstand some heat but I'm not sure exactly how much. I think they might be more resilient than say fleas because they live close to the scalp where it's warmer. But if you apply enough heat maybe it could dry them out or kill them.  I should consider how hair dryers work. They blow hot air which can make things dry quickly. If someone uses a hair dryer on a high setting for an extended period near their head would that generate enough heat to affect the lice? I'm not sure if the temperature from a typical hair dryer is sufficient or if it's too mild.  I also wonder about the duration needed. Lice might be able to survive short exposure but could die after prolonged heating. But using a hair dryer for too long near the scalp could be dangerous causing burns or damage to the hair and skin. So maybe while it might work it's not practical or safe.  Another thought: lice eggs (nits) are glued to the hair shafts. Would heat affect them? I think nits can be more resistant because they're protected by a shell. Maybe the heat wouldn't penetrate enough to kill them unless applied for a very long time which again isn't advisable.  I've also heard that some people use heat treatments in combination with other methods like applying oil or using a comb afterward. But on its own relying solely on a hair dryer might not be effective because it's hard to target all the lice and nits evenly across the scalp.  So putting this together: while the heat from a hair dryer can dry out some parts of the environment where lice live it's unlikely to kill them effectively without prolonged use or additional treatments. Plus there are safer and more proven methods available. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,79.99870940000983,0.028104712961000144,0.008252122406041713,0.0,0.0,0.0
111,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if ""Lord of All Hopefulness"" is a funeral hymn. Let me start by recalling what I know about this song. It's often sung in Christian churches especially during services and maybe special occasions. The title itself has ""hopefulness "" which suggests it's about positive emotions or faith.  I remember hearing it at funerals before. It does have a solemn tone but is that enough to classify it as a funeral hymn? Maybe I should think about the lyrics. They usually talk about trusting in God and finding hope even in difficult times. That could be comforting during a funeral which makes sense why it's used.  But wait are there other songs specifically written for funerals? Like ""Eternal Father Strong Defender"" or ""Nearer My God to Thee."" Those seem more directly associated with funerals. ""Lord of All Hopefulness"" might be more general and used in various services not just funerals.  I should also consider the structure of the song. It's a hymn that can be sung during different parts of the service maybe as a processional or recession. Funerals often have specific hymns that are traditional and somber but this one might fit into that category because it's used in those settings.  On the other hand since it's not exclusively written for funerals maybe it's more versatile. It could be sung during weddings or other services as well. So while it is used at funerals it's not solely a funeral hymn.  I think I've heard it in non-funeral contexts too like regular Sunday services when the theme is hope or faith. That makes me lean towards it being more of a general hymn that can be adapted for various occasions including funerals rather than being specifically a funeral hymn.  So putting it all together: while ""Lord of All Hopefulness"" is used in funerals and has themes suitable for such occasions it's not exclusively or primarily known as a funeral hymn. It serves a broader purpose in Christian worship. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,82.35166169999866,0.028933591465206552,0.008495498201622322,0.0,0.0,0.0
112,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether a peck and a bushel are the same thing. Hmm I remember hearing both terms before probably related to measurements. Let me think about where I've heard them. Maybe in old stories or maybe in cooking shows?   I think they're units of measurement for things like grains or fruits. But wait are they the same? Or are they different? I'm not entirely sure. I'll try to recall if I've ever seen both terms used together. Sometimes people use pecks when talking about apples right? Like a bushel of apples is a big amount but maybe a peck is smaller?  Wait I think a bushel is bigger than a peck. So they can't be the same because one is larger than the other. Let me try to remember the exact measurements. A bushel... isn't that like 128 quarts? And a peck is half of that? Or maybe it's different. I'm not certain but I think a peck is smaller.  I should also consider if they're both used for the same kind of products. Bushels are definitely used for things like wheat or corn and pecks might be used for fruits or vegetables in smaller quantities. So their uses might differ as well which would mean they aren't interchangeable terms.  Another angle: maybe they're both old English units? I think so. But even if they have the same origin that doesn't mean they're equal. Like how a mile and a kilometer are both distance measurements but not the same length.  I'm pretty confident now that a peck is half of a bushel. So they aren't the same; one is double the other. Therefore the answer should be False because they represent different quantities. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,80.93403839998064,0.02843239417745874,0.008348336358204445,0.0,0.0,0.0

But wait aren't there different types of big cats like lions tigers leopards and jaguars? So where do cougars fit in?  I've also heard the term ""mountain lion"" used especially in certain regions. I think people in North America might call them mountain lions while others refer to them as cougars. Are they different names for the same animal or are they distinct species?  Let me try to recall any documentaries or articles I've read. I think that cougars and mountain lions are actually the same animal. They're just different common names used in various places. So scientifically they belong to the same species.  Wait but sometimes people might confuse them with other big cats like panthers or jaguars. But no panthers are a bit different because they can be melanistic (all black) versions of other big cats whereas cougars and mountain lions have their own distinct features.  I should also consider if there's any subspecies differences. I don't think so; it's more about the regional names. For example in South America they might have different names for the same species. So in North America they're called mountain lions while elsewhere they're cougars.  So putting this together both terms refer to the same large wild cat Puma concolor.

First when someone is shot it depends on where they're hit and what kind of weapon is used. But the question specifically mentions a bullet shot ""in the air."" So maybe that refers to an air gun? Air guns use compressed air or gas to propel pellets or BBs. They usually have much lower kinetic energy compared to regular firearms.  I remember hearing that air guns can cause injuries but are they fatal? I think it's possible if someone is hit in a vital area especially with higher-powered air rifles. But generally the force isn't as strong as from a bullet from a gun. So maybe the risk of death is lower but not impossible.  Wait there have been cases where people died from air gun injuries right? Like if you're shot in the head or chest even with an air gun it could be fatal. But I'm not sure how common that is. Most air guns are designed for target practice or hunting small game so their pellets aren't as lethal.  On the other hand if someone is shot at close range with a high-velocity air gun maybe the force is enough to cause internal bleeding or damage vital organs. But I'm not certain about the exact stopping power of air guns compared to real firearms.  So considering all this it seems possible but unlikely for someone to die from an air gun shot unless hit in a critical area. Therefore the answer would be True because while rare fatalities can occur. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,79.35809640001389,0.027881951197627135,0.008186714965613816,0.0,0.0,0.0
115,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the hand ""ace 2 3 4 5"" is considered a straight. Let me start by recalling what a straight is in poker. A straight is when you have five cards in sequential order. The key thing here is that they must be consecutive numbers.  Now looking at the given hand: ace 2 3 4 5. At first glance these seem to follow each other numerically. Ace can sometimes be tricky because it's both high and low depending on the situation. In standard poker rules an ace can act as either a high card (like above king) or a low card (below 2). So in this case since we're starting with an ace followed by 2 3 4 5 it seems like the ace is being used as a low card to complete the sequence.  I remember that straights can wrap around from ace to 2. For example A-2-3-4-5 is considered a straight because each card follows the next in order. However sometimes people might confuse this with a wheel which is another term for a straight using the lowest possible cards (A-2-3-4-5). So yes that's definitely a straight.  Wait but I should make sure there are no exceptions or specific rules where this wouldn't count as a straight. In most poker variants like Texas Hold'em and Omaha A-2-3-4-5 is recognized as a straight. There's no rule against using the ace as a low card in this context so it should be valid.  I think I'm confident that yes an ace 2 3 4 5 does form a straight because each card follows the next numerically when considering the ace as a low card. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,79.05148199998075,0.02778124873093614,0.00815714664791288,0.0,0.0,0.0
116,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the movie ""Vertical Limit"" is based on a true story. Let me start by recalling what I know about the film. It's an action thriller that involves mountain climbing and some intense situations. From what I remember it stars people like Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Alba. The plot revolves around climbers ascending a mountain facing various dangers including avalanches and other life-threatening events.  I think the movie was released in 2018 so it's fairly recent. Now to determine if it's based on real events I should consider whether there have been any notable mountaineering incidents that match its plot. One famous event that comes to mind is the 1953 K2 expedition where a British team attempted to climb K2 the second highest peak in the world. There was a tragic accident during their descent when an avalanche occurred leading to several deaths.  I'm trying to remember if ""Vertical Limit"" is inspired by this specific incident. I think there were some similarities like the setting on K2 and the avalanche causing casualties. However I also recall that the movie took creative liberties with the story adding elements like a rescue mission and more action-oriented scenes that weren't part of the real event.  So while ""Vertical Limit"" might have been inspired by the 1953 K2 disaster it's not a direct adaptation or entirely based on true events. It uses the framework of a real incident but changes many details to fit the movie's narrative. Therefore the answer should be False because it's not strictly a true story but rather fictionalized. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,79.59812929999316,0.027981179137933847,0.008215850332007583,0.0,0.0,0.0
117,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Oakland Athletics have ever won a World Series. Let me think about this step by step.  First I know that the Oakland A's are a Major League Baseball team based in Oakland California. They used to be known as the Kansas City Athletics before moving to Oakland in 1968. I remember hearing that they had some success in the past especially during the late '70s and early '80s.  I think about the World Series winners. The World Series is the championship series between the American League and National League teams. Each year the winner of each league's pennant goes to the World Series. So I need to recall if the Oakland Athletics have been in any World Series and won it.  From what I remember the A's had a dominant team in the late '70s with players like Rickey Henderson Catfish Hunter and others. They were part of what was called the ""Dynasty"" era. I believe they won multiple World Series during that time.  Let me try to recall specific years. I think they won in 1972 1973 and 1974. That's three consecutive championships. After that they moved to Milwaukee for a short period but then returned to Oakland. I'm not sure if they won any World Series after moving back.  Wait no actually the team moved from Kansas City to Oakland in 1968 and their big success was in the early '70s. So yes they did win multiple World Series as the Oakland Athletics.  I don't think they've won any since then but I'm pretty sure they have at least three World Series titles under their belt when they were based in Oakland. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,81.09795080000185,0.028510787746030723,0.008371354324073732,0.0,0.0,0.0
118,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if you can buy alcohol on Sunday in Wisconsin. Hmm I'm not entirely sure about the laws there but I know that alcohol regulations vary by state. Let me think... I remember hearing something about ""Blue Laws"" which are laws that restrict certain activities on Sundays like buying alcohol.  Wait so in some places you can't buy alcohol on Sunday while others allow it with specific hours or restrictions. I'm not sure if Wisconsin has such a law. Maybe I should break this down. First does Wisconsin have any state-wide laws about Sunday alcohol sales? Or is it up to the individual counties or cities?  I think some states have local control meaning that each county can decide their own rules. So in Wisconsin perhaps some places allow Sunday sales while others don't. But I'm not certain if the entire state has a uniform rule.  Let me try to recall any specific information. I believe that as of recent years many states have changed their laws to allow alcohol sales on Sundays. Maybe Wisconsin is one of them? Or maybe they still have restrictions. I'm a bit confused because I don't remember exactly.  Wait another thought: some places might allow Sunday sales but only after a certain time like noon or later. So even if you can buy it there might be specific hours when stores are allowed to sell alcohol on Sundays.  I should also consider the type of store. For example grocery stores versus liquor stores. Maybe one is allowed and the other isn't. Or perhaps all retail outlets follow the same rules.  Another angle: checking recent news or updates. If Wisconsin recently changed their laws that could affect whether Sunday sales are permitted now. But I'm not sure about any recent changes in Wisconsin regarding this.  I think I need to make an educated guess based on what I know. Since many states have moved towards allowing Sunday alcohol sales it's possible that Wisconsin does too. However there might still be some restrictions or variations depending on the location within the state.  So putting it all together: It seems likely that you can buy alcohol on Sunday in Wisconsin but with possible time restrictions and varying by local laws. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,78.84009920002427,0.027729797244371614,0.008142039432062912,0.0,0.0,0.0
119,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the liver is part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Let me start by recalling what the GI tract includes. The GI tract also known as the digestive system typically starts at the mouth and goes through the esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine rectum and ends at the anus. These are all the organs involved in breaking down food absorbing nutrients and eliminating waste.  Now the liver is an organ I know is involved with digestion but isn't directly part of the GI tract as it's not a pass-through for food. The liver produces bile which helps break down fats in the small intestine. Bile is stored in the gallbladder which is connected to the small intestine via the common bile duct. So while the liver supports digestion by producing bile it doesn't directly come into contact with ingested food like the other GI organs do.  I should also consider if there's any overlap or if some sources might include the liver as part of the GI tract. But from what I remember in anatomy and physiology the liver is classified under the hepatic system or sometimes the digestive system but not as a component of the actual GI tract itself. The GI tract refers to the hollow organs that process food whereas the liver is more of an accessory organ.  Therefore based on this reasoning the liver isn't part of the GI tract. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,79.77213810000103,0.028057631211383285,0.008238298234933186,0.0,0.0,0.0
120,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if a person can have twins with different fathers. Hmm twins usually come from the same pregnancy right? So they're born at the same time. Now twins can be either identical or fraternal. Identical twins come from one fertilized egg splitting into two so they share the same genetic material. Fraternal twins are from two separate eggs being fertilized by two sperm so each twin has their own set of genes.  But wait if a woman is pregnant with twins can those twins have different fathers? That would mean that during her pregnancy she had two different sets of sperm that fertilized the eggs. But how does that happen? I think it's possible through something called heteropaternal superfecundation. From what I remember this occurs when a woman ovulates more than one egg and is impregnated by two different men within a short time frame.  I've heard of cases where this happens especially in situations where the woman has been with multiple partners around the time of conception. The twins would look like fraternal twins but have different fathers. So technically yes it's possible for twins to have different biological fathers if the mother was fertilized by two different men close enough in time.  I don't think there are any medical or biological barriers preventing this. It might be rare because it requires specific conditions—like the woman releasing multiple eggs and being with two partners around ovulation—but it's not impossible. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,74.88920930001768,0.026348676167323008,0.007736513846329846,0.0,0.0,0.0
121,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the statement ""can anyone give last rites in an emergency"" is true or false. Let me break this down step by step.  First what are last rites? From what I know last rites refer to the final religious ceremonies performed for a person who is dying or has died. In many Christian traditions particularly Roman Catholicism last rites include things like the sacrament of the dying (also known as the Anointing of the Sick) and may involve other rituals.  Now the question is about whether ""anyone"" can give these last rites in an emergency situation. The key here is understanding who is authorized to administer last rites. In the Catholic Church only ordained clergy—like priests—are permitted to administer sacraments including the Anointing of the Sick. So typically a priest would be the one to perform last rites.  But what about emergencies? If someone is in an emergency situation where a priest isn't available can another person step in? I think that according to Catholic doctrine only clergy have the authority and the ability to administer sacraments. Even in emergencies laypeople (non-clergy) aren't authorized to perform these rituals.  However there might be exceptions or specific circumstances where actions other than the actual sacrament are taken. For example a non-priest might recite certain prayers or provide spiritual support but they wouldn't actually administer the last rites themselves. The sacramental act requires the proper authority which only clergy possess.  So putting this together: since last rites require an ordained priest and emergencies don't typically change that requirement it's false that anyone can give last rites in an emergency. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,75.5676571999793,0.026579510661903342,0.007804291606859085,0.0,0.0,0.0
122,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the common femoral vein is a deep vein. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about veins and their classification.  I remember that veins can be categorized into superficial (or shallow) and deep veins. Superficial veins are located closer to the skin's surface while deep veins are found deeper within the body tissues often near bones or muscles. The naming sometimes gives a clue too; for example ""superficial"" is part of their name.  The common femoral vein is in the femoral region which is the area around the thigh. I think it's connected to the femoral artery because they share similar names. From what I've studied before the femoral artery is a deep artery that runs along the medial side of the thigh. Since the common femoral vein is paired with this artery it makes sense that it would be a deep vein as well.  I also remember that deep veins are usually larger and more significant in terms of blood return compared to superficial veins. They're closer to muscles and bones which helps them in venous return because they have better support from surrounding tissues.  Wait but sometimes there's confusion between the great saphenous vein and the common femoral vein. The great saphenous is a superficial vein that drains into the common femoral vein. So the common femoral itself isn't superficial; it's deeper receiving blood from both deep and some superficial veins.  Another point: in terms of clinical relevance accessing deep veins like the common femoral is often preferred for IV access because they're more stable and have a higher flow rate compared to superficial ones.  So putting this all together the common femoral vein is indeed a deep vein because it's located deeper within the thigh near the femoral artery plays a major role in venous return and isn't close to the skin surface like superficial veins are. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,75.38344459998189,0.02651290517147174,0.0077847348634502945,0.0,0.0,0.0
123,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Garfield is a real cat in the movie. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about Garfield. I remember that Garfield is a cartoon character right? He's an orange tabby cat who loves lasagna and often has humorous interactions with his owner Jon and other characters like Odie the dog.  Now thinking about movies based on cartoons sometimes they are live-action or animated adaptations. The question is specifically asking if Garfield is a real cat in the movie. So I should consider whether any of these films portray Garfield as a real live cat or if he's still an animated character.  I think there have been several Garfield movies over the years. Some are animated like ""Garfield: The Movie"" from 2004 which is computer-animated. Then there was a live-action movie in 2019 called ""Garfield's Big Break "" but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Wait no actually the main Garfield movies are animated. In those Garfield is definitely an animated character not a real cat.  If there were a live-action version where Garfield was portrayed by a real cat that would be unusual because training cats for acting is difficult and they don't typically perform on command like dogs might. Plus I haven't heard of any Garfield movie featuring a real cat in the lead role. Most animated films use voice actors and CGI to bring characters to life.  So putting it all together since Garfield is primarily an animated character in his movies and there's no known live-action version with a real cat playing him I can conclude that Garfield isn't portrayed as a real cat in the movie. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,69.93011089999345,0.02459431924388213,0.007221398531108149,0.0,0.0,0.0
124,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""The Young and the Restless"" is going off the air. First I know that it's a long-running soap opera. It started back in 1973 right? That's over 50 years ago. So it's been on for a really long time.  I remember hearing about other shows getting canceled but I don't think this one has been announced to stop yet. Maybe I should check recent news or official sources. Sometimes TV networks announce renewals or cancellations around the same time each year usually after a season wraps up.  Wait the latest information I have is from 2023. As of that year there were no reports saying it was ending. In fact soap operas like this one tend to stay on because they have a dedicated audience and are cheaper to produce compared to other shows. They just need daily episodes so it's more about maintaining the storylines rather than big production costs.  Also ""The Young and the Restless"" has been through many changes but keeps going. The network CBS probably wouldn't cancel such a long-running show without some big reason. I don't recall any major issues or declining ratings that would lead to its cancellation.  So putting it all together there's no concrete information suggesting it's ending soon. It's still on the air as far as I know. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,67.43393440000364,0.023708760625236056,0.006961380286875117,0.0,0.0,0.0
125,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the internal resistance of a battery changes. Hmm let's start by understanding what internal resistance is. From what I remember internal resistance is the opposition to the flow of current within the battery itself. It includes things like the resistance of the electrolyte and the plates in a lead-acid battery for example.  Now does this resistance stay the same or change over time? Well when a battery is new it's probably at its optimal condition so maybe the internal resistance is lower then. But as the battery ages things might start to degrade. The electrolyte could become less efficient and the plates might corrode or sulfate which would increase the internal resistance.  Also during use when you discharge a battery especially if it's being used to power something the current drawn can affect the internal resistance. I think that as the battery discharges its voltage drops and part of that drop is due to the internal resistance. So maybe under load the internal resistance effectively increases because more current is flowing causing more voltage drop.  Another factor could be temperature. If the battery gets hot whether from use or environmental conditions the internal resistance might decrease because higher temperatures can lower resistivity in materials. Conversely if it's too cold resistance might increase. So temperature fluctuations would cause changes in internal resistance.  Additionally over time as a battery is charged and discharged repeatedly there might be some wear and tear inside that affects its components' ability to conduct electricity efficiently. This could lead to an increase in internal resistance over the battery's lifespan.  So putting it all together internal resistance isn't static. It can change based on factors like age usage patterns temperature and the battery's state of charge or discharge. Therefore the answer should be that yes the internal resistance does change. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,70.4163543000177,0.024760698774507803,0.007270250987081924,0.0,0.0,0.0
126,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the cortex of the cerebellum is gray matter. Let me start by recalling what I know about the brain's structure.  The cerebellum is a part of the brain located at the back near the base of the skull. It's known for its role in motor control coordination and balance. Now when thinking about the cortex that refers to the outer layer or covering of a brain structure. In the case of the cerebrum which is the main part of the brain the cortex is indeed gray matter consisting mostly of neurons.  But wait the question is specifically about the cerebellum's cortex. I remember that the cerebellum has its own cortex as well. The cerebellar cortex is a thin layer covering the surface of the cerebellum. Now what kind of tissue does this cortex consist of? Gray matter in the brain typically refers to areas rich in neuron cell bodies dendrites and axons which are usually found on the surfaces of the brain.  In contrast white matter consists mostly of myelinated axons that carry signals between different parts of the brain. So if the cerebellar cortex is the outer layer it should be similar to other cortices in terms of structure. That would mean it's gray matter because it contains a high concentration of neurons and their processes.  I don't think I'm confusing this with the cerebrum's cortex. The cerebellum's cortex serves a specific function related to motor control but structurally it should still be gray matter. Therefore the answer should be true. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,59.02132199998596,0.020755275467833147,0.006094176231913338,0.0,0.0,0.0
127,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if ""The Greatest Showman"" is based on a true story. Let me think about what I know about this movie. It's a musical that came out a few years ago right? The main character is P.T. Barnum who I remember was a famous showman and circus owner. But wait wasn't he also involved in things like circuses and museums?  I think the movie portrays him as someone who started a traveling circus and maybe some of his other ventures. Now I'm not entirely sure if all the events in the movie actually happened or if they took creative liberties. I remember hearing that P.T. Barnum did some controversial things like promoting people with disabilities as ""freak shows "" which is something the movie touches on but perhaps softens.  Also there's a character named Phillip Carlyle in the film who is portrayed as a journalist who becomes part of Barnum's team. I'm not sure if that person was real or just a creation for the story. Then there's the song ""The Greatest Show"" which became pretty popular but I don't know if that reflects actual events.  I should also consider historical accuracy. P.T. Barnum did exist and he was known for his shows including the use of Jumbo the elephant though I'm not sure how much of that is in the movie. The film seems to focus more on the human elements and relationships rather than sticking strictly to facts.  So putting it all together while the movie is inspired by P.T. Barnum's life and his creation of the circus it takes creative liberties and isn't entirely based on a true story. It's more of a fictionalized account with some historical figures and events woven into a narrative that serves the storytelling. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,64.75863699999172,0.022760029332173623,0.006682813244697618,0.0,0.0,0.0
