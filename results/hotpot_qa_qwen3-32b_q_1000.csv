Question: What is the name of the daughter of the Irish entertainer in the girl band Maxi, Dick and Twink?
Answer:","The question references a girl band named ""Maxi Dick and Twink."" The name is a play on the real-life Irish entertainer Maxi (Maxine) Doyle who was part of the 1960s girl group. However there is no public record or credible information indicating that Maxi Doyle had a daughter who was part of a band called ""Maxi Dick and Twink."" The name is likely fictional or a joke as ""Dick"" and ""Twink"" are not typical names for a band member and may be used for comedic or satirical effect. Therefore the ""daughter"" in question does not exist in any verified context.
