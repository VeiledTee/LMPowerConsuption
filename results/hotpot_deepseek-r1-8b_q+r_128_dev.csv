The context also states that Ted Baker plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.  The question specifies ""the largest store "" but the context doesn't explicitly compare sizes or determine which is the largest. However it does mention that Hugo Boss has stores in Manchester specifically on New Cathedral Street and that these are described as being outside London with significant presence.  But the key point is identifying the stock index associated with a major company located there. The context directly links Ted Baker to the FTSE 250 Index via its listing on the London Stock Exchange.  While Hugo Boss might be implied in the area the explicit connection to a stock index is provided for Ted Baker through the FTSE 250.  Therefore based on the information given New Cathedral Street has a store (Burberry) that could be considered major or large but the answer should focus on the stock index mentioned. The context doesn't specify which company's store is largest so relying on direct references from the text seems appropriate.  The question says ""the largest store "" and while Hugo Boss stores are noted as being outside London with size implied by their presence in Manchester (a major retail area) the explicit stock index connection is to Ted Baker via FTSE 250. However the context doesn't state that Ted Baker's store on New Cathedral Street is the largest.  This might be a misinterpretation. The question asks for the stock index of which the store located outside London (on New Cathedral Street) is part. But it says ""the largest store "" and while Hugo Boss stores are mentioned they aren't explicitly linked to an index in this context snippet.  Looking back: ""New Cathedral Street... is home to...

Wait no:  From the text: ""...and Harvey Nichols the largest Ted Baker...""  Yes it states that Harvey Nichols has the largest Ted Baker store.  But Ted Baker is listed on FTSE 250 not necessarily related to its stores being large or part of an index directly tied to size in this context.  The question asks for a stock index. The only direct mention of a stock index and a company located outside London with a presence there is Ted Baker's store on New Cathedral Street (which is part of FTSE 250).  Hugo Boss isn't mentioned as being listed on any exchange or having an index association in the context.  Therefore despite Hugo Boss being a major brand the stock index explicitly connected to a company located outside London and on New Cathedral Street is the FTSE 250 for Ted Baker.  The question says ""the largest store that is located outside London."" But it doesn't specify which one. It just asks about such a store part of what index.  In the context Hugo Boss stores are noted as being in Manchester (outside London) and described as large or prominent but no stock index is mentioned for them.  Ted Baker's store on New Cathedral Street is explicitly stated to be part of FTSE 250 Index via its listing on London Stock Exchange.  Moreover the text says: ""Harvey Nichols the largest Ted Baker..."" implying that while Hugo Boss stores are large Harvey Nichols has the largest Ted Baker store. But since we're focusing on stock index and Ted Baker is directly linked to FTSE 250 that's likely what the question refers to.  The answer should be based on the provided context without additional knowledge. The context mentions:  - ""Ted Baker plc... listed on London Stock Exchange... constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.""  And New Cathedral Street has a Ted Baker store (since it says stores are located there).  Therefore even though Hugo Boss is also mentioned as being in Manchester and potentially large the stock index explicitly stated for a company with a store outside London is FTSE 250.  The question might be interpreted to mean that among the companies listed on New Cathedral Street or nearby (like Hugo Boss) which one has its largest store there? But it doesn't specify ""largest"" in terms of size just that such a store exists and we need to find its index.  But from context: ""New Cathedral Street... is home to... Ted Baker..."" directly. And for Hugo Boss no specific location on New Cathedral Street is mentioned beyond being in Manchester generally.  The text says: ""the largest Ted Baker"" store but it's part of the description of Harvey Nichols having that not necessarily defining which company has a large store there.  Perhaps I should stick to direct associations.  Let me re-read:  ""The MASI index... It is one of two main indices at the bourse...""  Nope unrelated.  ""The DAX... constituent of the FTSE 250 Index."" Wait no that's not right. The context says: ""It is the equivalent of the FT 30 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average""  But then separately: ""Ted Baker plc... listed on London Stock Exchange... constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.""  And New Cathedral Street has a Ted Baker store.  Also from earlier: ""New Cathedral Street... home to... Ted Baker...""  So directly there is a store (Ted Baker) located outside London on New Cathedral Street that is part of the FTSE 250 Index.  The question says ""the largest store "" but in this context it's not specified which one is largest. However since Hugo Boss isn't linked to an index and Ted Baker is perhaps the answer refers to Ted Baker.  But let's see if there's any other stock index mentioned for companies outside London with stores on New Cathedral Street.  The only indices discussed are:  - PSI-20 (Portugal) - MASI (Morocco) - DAX (Germany) - Zimbabwe Mining Index - FTSE 250  And among these the one that includes a company with a store in Manchester (outside London) is FTSE 250 for Ted Baker.  Hugo Boss isn't mentioned as being listed on any exchange or having an index association.  Therefore based on context the stock index associated with a major retailer outside London located near New Cathedral Street is FTSE 250 via Ted Baker.  The question says ""the largest store that is located outside London."" But it doesn't specify which one. It just asks about such a store part of what index.  In the text: ""Harvey Nichols the largest Ted Baker..."" so if we're talking about Ted Baker's stores being large then yes.  But perhaps I should answer based on direct context without assuming size comparison unless specified.  The question is: New Cathedral Street has the largest store that is located outside London that is a part of what stock index?  From context:  - New Cathedral Street is home to Ted Baker and Hugo Boss. - Ted Baker is listed on London Stock Exchange constituent of FTSE 250 Index. - Hugo Boss isn't mentioned with any listing or index.  Also the text says: ""the largest Ted Baker"" store (meaning Ted Baker's stores are large) but it doesn't say that the one in Manchester is the largest Ted Baker store necessarily; just that Harvey Nichols has the largest Ted Baker store among its branches? No it says Harvey Nichols is the largest Ted Baker store.  Let me parse:  ""...and Hugo Boss... stores... outside London...""  Then: ""...Harvey Nichols the largest Ted Baker and..."" Wait no from text: ""the largest Ted Baker"" – actually in the context provided earlier I think there was a mention of Hugo Boss being large or prominent but let's check.  In the initial user message:  ""...and Harvey Nichols the largest Ted Baker...""  Yes so it says that Harvey Nichols has the largest Ted Baker store. But this doesn't directly help with identifying which stock index is for the company located outside London on New Cathedral Street.  The context also mentions: ""Ted Baker plc... listed on London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.""  So regardless of size Ted Baker's stores are part of companies that are constituents of FTSE 250 because Ted Baker itself is listed there.  Therefore for the purpose of this question since New Cathedral Street has a Ted Baker store (which is large according to context) and it's part of FTSE 250 Index that should be the answer.  The other major brand mentioned is Hugo Boss but no stock index is provided in the context for Hugo Boss or its stores being part of one directly from this snippet.  Thus I think the intended answer is FTSE 250. </think> FTSE 250","The question asks about New Cathedral Street having the largest store outside London that is part of a specific stock index.

Hugo Boss isn't mentioned as being listed on any exchange or having an index association in the context.

The question might be interpreted to mean that among the companies listed on New Cathedral Street or nearby (like Hugo Boss), which one has its largest store there? But it doesn't specify ""largest"" in terms of size, just that such a store exists and we need to find its index.

But from context: ""New Cathedral Street... is home to... Ted Baker..."" directly. And for Hugo Boss, no specific location on New Cathedral Street is mentioned beyond being in Manchester generally.

The text says: ""the largest Ted Baker"" store, but it's part of the description of Harvey Nichols having that, not necessarily defining which company has a large store there.

Perhaps I should stick to direct associations.

Let me re-read:

""The MASI index... It is one of two main indices at the bourse...""

Nope, unrelated.

""The DAX... constituent of the FTSE 250 Index."" Wait no, that's not right. The context says: ""It is the equivalent of the FT 30 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average""

But then separately: ""Ted Baker plc... listed on London Stock Exchange... constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.""

And New Cathedral Street has a Ted Baker store.

Also, from earlier: ""New Cathedral Street... home to... Ted Baker...""

So, directly, there is a store (Ted Baker) located outside London on New Cathedral Street that is part of the FTSE 250 Index.

The question says ""the largest store,"" but in this context, it's not specified which one is largest. However, since Hugo Boss isn't linked to an index and Ted Baker is, perhaps the answer refers to Ted Baker.

But let's see if there's any other stock index mentioned for companies outside London with stores on New Cathedral Street.

The only indices discussed are:

- PSI-20 (Portugal)
- MASI (Morocco)
- DAX (Germany)
- Zimbabwe Mining Index
- FTSE 250

And among these, the one that includes a company with a store in Manchester (outside London) is FTSE 250 for Ted Baker.

Hugo Boss isn't mentioned as being listed on any exchange or having an index association.

Therefore, based on context, the stock index associated with a major retailer outside London located near New Cathedral Street is FTSE 250 via Ted Baker.

The question says ""the largest store that is located outside London."" But it doesn't specify which one. It just asks about such a store part of what index.

In the text: ""Harvey Nichols, the largest Ted Baker..."" so if we're talking about Ted Baker's stores being large, then yes.

But perhaps I should answer based on direct context without assuming size comparison unless specified.

The question is: New Cathedral Street has the largest store that is located outside London that is a part of what stock index?

From context:

- New Cathedral Street is home to Ted Baker and Hugo Boss.
- Ted Baker is listed on London Stock Exchange, constituent of FTSE 250 Index.
- Hugo Boss isn't mentioned with any listing or index.

Also, the text says: ""the largest Ted Baker"" store (meaning Ted Baker's stores are large), but it doesn't say that the one in Manchester is the largest Ted Baker store necessarily; just that Harvey Nichols has the largest Ted Baker store among its branches? No, it says Harvey Nichols is the largest Ted Baker store.

Let me parse:

""...and Hugo Boss... stores... outside London...""

Then: ""...Harvey Nichols, the largest Ted Baker and..."" Wait no, from text: ""the largest Ted Baker"" – actually in the context provided earlier, I think there was a mention of Hugo Boss being large or prominent, but let's check.

In the initial user message:

""...and Harvey Nichols, the largest Ted Baker...""

Yes, so it says that Harvey Nichols has the largest Ted Baker store. But this doesn't directly help with identifying which stock index is for the company located outside London on New Cathedral Street.

The context also mentions: ""Ted Baker plc... listed on London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.""

So, regardless of size, Ted Baker's stores are part of companies that are constituents of FTSE 250 because Ted Baker itself is listed there.

Therefore, for the purpose of this question, since New Cathedral Street has a Ted Baker store (which is large according to context), and it's part of FTSE 250 Index, that should be the answer.

The other major brand mentioned is Hugo Boss, but no stock index is provided in the context for Hugo Boss or its stores being part of one directly from this snippet.

Thus, I think the intended answer is FTSE 250.
