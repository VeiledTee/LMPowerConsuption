Context: Education in Cambodia: Education in Cambodia is controlled by the state through the Ministry of Education in a national level and by the Department of Education at the provincial level. The Constitution of Cambodia establishes that the state shall protect and upgrade citizen's rights to quality education at all levels, guaranteeing that all citizens have equal opportunity to earn a living (Article 66). The state shall adopt an education program ""according to the principle of modern pedagogy including technology and foreign languages,"" as well as the state controls public and private schools and classrooms at all levels (Article 67). The Cambodian education system includes pre-school, primary, general secondary, higher education and non-formal education. The education system includes the development of sport, information technology education, research development and technical education. School enrollment has increased during the 2000s in Cambodia.

European Master's in Translation: The European Master's in Translation (EMT) is a partnership project between the ""Directorate-General for Translation"" (DGT) of the ""European Commission"" and a number of universities from a wide range of European countries. EMT is a quality label for translation programmes that offer a Master's degree. The DGT awards the label to higher education programmes that meet the EMT quality standards for translator training. Master programmes that meet these standards can become members of the EMT network. The initial project was launched in 2006 and the first network was set up in December 2009, following a rigorous selection in which applicant university programmes were evaluated by academic assessors. This first EMT Network consisted of 34 universities in 16 European countries. In 2011, 20 more programmes were selected, bringing the total number of members to 54 programmes in 20 European countries. In the most recent selection round in 2014, EMT membership increased to 63 member programmes from 22 countries, including two non-EU members (from Switzerland). The project serves as a model in its approach to convergence in higher education in Europe, in the broad context of the Bologna process.
Faculty of Biotechnical Sciences: The Faculty of Biotechnical Sciences is a public state higher education research institution in the area of biotechnical sciences. The main task of this institution is to enable the graduated students with knowledge and skills for individual managing of small family business in the area of biotechnology. This Faculty is the only one of its kind in the country and has characteristic study programs. Starting for the year 1999/2000 by virtue of the Decision of the Ministry of Education (ref. 12-2920/2-1999), the Higher Agricultural School had grown into a Faculty of Biotechnical Sciences. Within the ten years of functioning, the Faculty has educated many engineers (bachelor) and masters who are included in the food production industry. Formally, the Faculty of Biotechnical Sciences is a higher level of the Higher Agricultural School dating back from 1960. The launching of such higher educational institution signified filling a gap of many decades in the higher education system of biotechnical sciences and educating staff for the food production capacities. The higher education activities of the Faculty of Biotechnical Sciences are organized on different levels of higher education: graduate studies, postgraduate studies and acquiring level of doctor of science, as well as many fundamental, developmental and applicative researches, conducting complex research projects of wider interest for the environment, courses, seminars, workshop for the staff and the students. The graduate studies of the three study programs (animal food processing, management in bio-technique and farm production) are realized in accordance with the ECTS system and adjustment of the study programs with the legal regulations. The teaching activities of these study programs are organized in eight semesters (four years) for the first two and six semesters (three years) for the last study program. Teaching is realized as: lectures, tutorials – seminars, seminar papers and obligative practical training. Postgraduate studies are realized as: lectures, exams and other form of teaching activities. After preparation and defending of the master thesis, the postgraduate students acquire the title of Master of Biotechnical Sciences. The title Doctor of Biotechnical Sciences is acquired after completing doctoral studies and defending doctoral dissertation or only by defending the doctoral dissertation.

5,"Answer the following to the best of your ability. You must provide an answer. If you are unsure, make an educated guess based on what you know and the context provided. Context: Functional (C++): In the context of the programming language C++, codice_1 refers to a header file that is part of the C++ Standard Library and provides a set of predefined class templates for function objects, including operations for arithmetic, comparisons, and logic. Instances of these class templates are C++ classes that define a function call operator, and the instances of these classes can be called as if they were functions. It is possible to perform very sophisticated operations without writing a new function object, simply by combining predefined function objects and function object adaptors.
DSP/BIOS Link: DSP/BIOS Link or DSPLINK is an IPC (interprocessor communications) scheme for passing messages and data in multiprocessor systems. In the case of the DaVinci DSP family from Texas Instruments, this scheme would allow passing of messages and data between an ARM client and a DSP server. DSPLINK can be used to implement a layer of software abstraction called a RPC that allows a remote function on the DSP to appear as local function calls in the ARM application code. The Codec Engine IPC communication layer is implemented using a RPC call scheme built on top of DSP/BIOS LINK.
Remote Function Call: Remote Function Call is the proprietary SAP SE interface. Remote Function Call (RFC) is the standard SAP interface for communication between SAP systems. The RFC calls a function to be executed in a remote system. Remote function calls may be associated with SAP software and ABAP programming and provide a way for an external program (written in languages such as PHP, ASP, Java, or C, C++) to use data returned from the server. Data transactions are not limited to getting data from the server, but can insert data into server records as well. SAP can act as the Client or Server in an RFC call.
Intrinsic function: In compiler theory, an intrinsic function (or builtin function) is a function available for use in a given programming language whose implementation is handled specially by the compiler. Typically, it may substitute a sequence of automatically generated instructions for the original function call, similar to an inline function. Unlike an inline function though, the compiler has an intimate knowledge of the intrinsic function and can therefore better integrate it and optimize it for the situation.
Evaluation strategy: Programming languages use evaluation strategies to determine when to evaluate the argument(s) of a function call (for function, also read: operation, method, or relation) and what kind of value to pass to the function. For example, call by value/call by reference specifies that a function application evaluates the argument before it proceeds to the evaluation of the function's body and that it passes two capabilities to the function, namely, the ability to look up the current value of the argument and to modify it via an assignment statement. The notion of reduction strategy in lambda calculus is similar but distinct.
Function overloading: In some programming languages, function overloading or method overloading is the ability to create multiple methods of the same name with different implementations. Calls to an overloaded function will run a specific implementation of that function appropriate to the context of the call, allowing one function call to perform different tasks depending on context.
GridRPC: GridRPC is Remote Procedure Call over a grid. This paradigm has been proposed by the GridRPC working group of the Open Grid Forum (OGF), and an API has been defined in order for clients to access remote servers as simply as a function call. It is used among numerous Grid middleware for its simplicity of implementation, and has been standardized by the OGF in 2007.
Uniform Function Call Syntax: Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS) or sometimes Universal Function Call Syntax is a programming language feature in D, Rust and Nim that allows any function to be called
Double dispatch: In software engineering, double dispatch is a special form of multiple dispatch, and a mechanism that dispatches a function call to different concrete functions depending on the runtime types of two objects involved in the call. In most object-oriented systems, the concrete function that is called from a function call in the code depends on the dynamic type of a single object and therefore they are known as single dispatch calls, or simply virtual function calls.
Shadow stack: In software, a shadow stack is a mechanism for maintaining control-flow integrity by mitigating return address overwrites such as those seen during exploitation of a stack buffer overflow. The technique is to first keep a record of the execution time until all other threads have received their own copy after executing them at once; then ensure no more copies occur while processing each thread simultaneously so there isn't a need anymore overhead due both memory usage and CPU utilization issues resulting directly onto another process which could cause problems later than expected because many processes do receive",Walldorf,0,0.0,1.9861839000077453,0.0005406591622210625,0.00015874866228974998,0.04295270000875462,1.1674018332592418e-05,3.427732152419015e-06

North Eastern Railway War Memorial: The North Eastern Railway War Memorial is a First World War memorial in York in northern England. It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens to commemorate employees of the North Eastern Railway (NER) who left to fight in the First World War and were killed while serving. The NER board voted in early 1920 to allocate £20,000 for a memorial and commissioned Lutyens. The committee for the York City War Memorial followed suit and also appointed Lutyens, but both schemes became embroiled in controversy. Concerns were raised from within the community about the effect of the NER memorial on the city walls and its impact on the proposed scheme for the city's war memorial, given that the two memorials were planned to be 100 yd apart and the city's budget was a tenth of the NER's. The controversy was resolved after Lutyens modified his plans for the NER memorial to move it away from the walls and the city opted for a revised scheme on land just outside the walls; coincidentally the land was owned by the NER, whose board donated it to the city.

Context: Let There Be Love (1953 Joni James album): Let There Be Love is Joni James debut album, recorded in 1953 and released by MGM Records at the end of the year. It was released in a four-disc 10-inch 78-rpm record box, in both a two-disc 7-inch 45-rpm extended-play foldout album and a four-disc 45-rpm regular-play box and on a 10-inch 33⅓-rpm album. The serial number, 222, coincidentally included James's lucky number, ""22,"" which appeared in many of her record serial numbers all over the world. The album is the first to present its songs as a book in music, opening with ""Let There Be Love"" and closing with ""I'll Be Seeing You"", with the songs telling a story start to finish. The memorable cover was done at M-G-M Pictures Studios in Culver City by artist Russ Gale. From the album a single of ""Let There Be Love"" and ""You're Nearer"" was shipped to radio stations. Then, by public demand, a single of ""You're My Everything"" and ""You're Nearer"" was released. This album offered Joni's second recording of ""Let There Be Love,"" which had been released in an earlier version in 1952 as her first single on Sharp Records in Chicago, then going to M-G-M Records for further distribution. Both recordings were arranged and conducted by Lew Douglas. ""Let There Be Love"" went to the top of the album charts and was the sixth-best-selling album of 1953. In 1956 the album was reissued as a 12-inch L.P. and in three single EPs; there was no EP set including the entire album. For this release, four Joni James singles were added, but one of them had never been released. That was ""I Need You Now,"" which was to have followed the hit ""My Love, My Love"" but was canceled when Eddie Fisher came out with a version recorded several weeks after Joni's. M-G-M had expected Joni's original version to go straight to #1. For the new album the first four songs and second four songs were switched to get ""You're My Everything"" in the outside groove of the L.P. to facilitate disc jockey play. So, for 50 years, the story the album tells has been garbled. In 1961 the album got new cover art, a new serial number (E3931), and an electronically simulated stereo release. Released again on compact disk with yet more bonus tracks, the album is in its fifth decade as a best seller. Joni James hopes for yet another release which will restore the original song order. Significantly, for her last M-G-M album, ""Bossa Nova Style"", Joni included new recordings of several songs from ""Let There Be Love"", including a new single of ""You're Nearer."" That album was arranged by Lew Douglas's protégé Chuck Sagle. This information comes from Wayne Brasler, longtime President of the Joni James International Fan Club and the writer of the album notes for all Joni James' CD releases.

West Indies Federation: The West Indies Federation, also known as the West Indies, the Federation of the West Indies or the West Indian Federation, was a short-lived political union that existed from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962.

Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period: Jerusalem during the Second Temple period describes the history of the city from the return to Zion under Cyrus the Great to the 70 CE siege of Jerusalem by Titus during the First Jewish–Roman War, which saw both region and city change hands several times. It was the center of religious life for all Jews, even those who lived in the diaspora prayed towards Jerusalem on a daily basis and made pilgrimages during religious festivals. The Pharisees of Second Temple Judaism developed into the Tannaim and Judaism's post-Exilic religious identity as it continues today, and the Hebrew Bible was perhaps canonized, although exactly when this occurred remains disputed.

Land of Onias: The Land of Onias (Greek: Ὀνίας ) is the name given in Hellenistic Egyptian, Jewish, and Roman sources to an area in Ancient Egypt's Nile delta where a large number of Jews settled. The Land of Onias, which included the city of Leontopolis (Λεόντων πόλις), was located in the nome of Heliopolis. While accounts differ on the details, it is known that the Jews of Leontopolis had a functioning Temple, presided over by kohanim of the family of Onias IV (for whom the ""Land of Onias"" is named). Like its predecessor the Jewish Temple at Elephantine (destroyed in the 4th century BCE), the Temple at Leontopolis was the only Jewish sanctuary outside of Jerusalem where sacrifices were offered. Aside from a somewhat uncertain allusion of the Hellenist Artapanus, only Josephus gives information about this temple. The Talmudic accounts are internally contradictory. The establishment of a central sanctuary in Egypt was probably undertaken in response, in part, to the disorders that arose in Judea under Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the desecration of the Temple at Jerusalem under his reign, the supplanting of the legitimate family of priests by the installation of Alcimus, the personal ambition of Onias IV, and the vast extent of the Jewish diaspora in Egypt that created demand for a sanctuary of this nature.

Further elements of governance are outlined in the rest of the Canadian constitution, which includes written statutes, court rulings, and unwritten conventions developed over centuries.
List of members of the Swiss Federal Council: The seven members of the Swiss Federal Council (German: ""Schweizerischer Bundesrat"" ; French: ""Conseil fédéral suisse"" ; Italian: ""Consiglio federale svizzero"" ; Romansh: ""Cussegl federal svizzer"" ) constitute the federal government of Switzerland and serve as the country's head of state. Each of the seven Councillors heads a department of the Swiss federal administration.
Canada–Quebec Accord: The Canada–Quebec Accord is a legal agreement concerning immigration issues between the federal government of Canada and the government of Quebec. The broad accord signed in 1991 preceded similar agreements with other provinces including British Columbia and Manitoba. The arrangement gives Quebec the exclusive responsibility of choosing immigrants and refugees still living in their own countries but wishing to relocate to the province. Selected applicants are issued a ""certificat de sélection du Québec"". Immigrants who settle also can be required by Québec's provincial government, to send their children to French-language schools. Citizenship and Immigration Canada issues the actual visa after background and health verifications. The provinces also have agreements with the federal government in that they can nominate individuals for immigration purposes, similar to the way Quebec does.
Canada under British rule: Canada first came under British rule with the Treaty of Paris (1763) which ceded New France, of which Canada was a part, to the British Empire. Gradually, other territories, colonies, and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas. With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada. Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation. Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949. Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of Article 502(c)(3), where it had been incorporated.[1] This treaty allowed Canadians to establish independent governments from each another without having any direct influence whatsoever upon them; however this did not change much since then because there has never been one instance during World War II involving Britain being involved in war against Germany",The sponsorship scandal,0,0.002560819462227913,1.8693191000056686,0.000508849484444363,0.0001494086859279801,0.11160329999984242,3.035838888762454e-05,8.913848061659019e-06

Context: Time–frequency analysis for music signals: Time–frequency analysis for music signals is one of the applications of time–frequency analysis. Musical sound can be more complicated than human vocal sound, occupying a wider band of frequency. Music signals are time-varying signals; while the classic Fourier transform is not sufficient to analyze them, time–frequency analysis is an efficient tool for such use. Time–frequency analysis is extended from the classic Fourier approach. Short-time Fourier transform (STFT), Gabor transform (GT) and Wigner distribution function (WDF) are famous time–frequency methods, useful for analyzing music signals such as notes played on a piano, a flute or a guitar.

Compass: A compass is an instrument used for navigation and orientation that shows direction relative to the geographic cardinal directions (or points). Usually, a diagram called a compass rose shows the directions north, south, east, and west on the compass face as abbreviated initials. When the compass is used, the rose can be aligned with the corresponding geographic directions; for example, the ""N"" mark on the rose really points northward. Compasses often display markings for angles in degrees in addition to (or sometimes instead of) the rose. North corresponds to 0°, and the angles increase clockwise, so east is 90° degrees, south is 180°, and west is 270°. These numbers allow the compass to show azimuths or bearings, which are commonly stated in this notation.
Cardinal direction: The four cardinal directions or cardinal points are the directions north, east, south, and west, commonly denoted by their initials, N, E, S, W. East and west are at right angles to north and south, with east being in the clockwise direction of rotation from north and west being directly opposite east. Points between the cardinal directions form the points of the compass. The intermediate (intercardinal or ordinal) directions are northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NW). The intermediate direction of every set of intercardinal and cardinal direction is called a secondary-intercardinal direction, the eight shortest points in the compass rose that is shown to the right—e.g., NNE, ENE, ESE.
University of Sydney Quadrangle: The Quadrangle is a prominent sandstone building located within the University of Sydney Camperdown Campus. Taking over 100 years to complete, the Quadrangle was designed and developed by numerous contributors including Edmund Blacket, James Barnet, and Leslie Wilkinson. The original building included the Great Hall and was constructed between 1855 and 1862. Construction on the quadrangle began in 1854, it had four sides by 1926, and was completed in the 1960s after several stages of development. It comprises the Great Hall, MacLaurin Hall, Faculty of Arts office and the Nicholson Museum. MacLaurin Hall was constructed from 1902-1904 and was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon. The architectural style of the Quadrangle is gothic revival. The building is mostly constructed of Sydney sandstone and is unique in the Australian architectural landscape. At the time of its completion, the Quadrangle was ‘the largest public building in the colony.’ The Traditional Indigenous owners of the land on which the Quadrangle was built are the Cadigal and Wangal tribes of the Eora people. The main entrance - constructed first along with the Great Hall - is underneath the clock tower, which holds one of only two carillons in Australia.

Wolsey planned that it would actually be a cloister, and the supports required for this can be seen at short intervals around the quadrangle. The quad was finished when John Fell was Dean. The funds for the building of Tom Quad were found from the suppression of three Norbertine abbeys. It is dominated to the west by Tom Tower, designed primarily to accommodate students who have been studying classical music since they arrived here.[1] In order fund construction work there will also be additional funding opportunities available through grants made under Section 8(a)(3).[2][4].",Manasseh Cutler Hall,0,0.002597402597402597,1.6875827000039862,0.0004593700738908309,0.0001348805122002094,0.24421499999880325,6.646119499798967e-05,1.951437529841617e-05

Context: Puerto Rican Figure Skating Championships: The Puerto Rican Figure Skating Championships are the figure skating national championships held annually to crown the national champions of Puerto Rico. Skaters compete in the disciplines of men's singles and ladies singles across the levels of senior (Olympic-level), junior, novice, intermediate, and juvenile. Not every event has been held in every year due to a lack of entries. The National Championships are organized by the Puerto Rican Figure Skating Federation. The Puerto Rican Figure Skating Federation is not affiliated with the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee (In Spanish, Comite Olimpico de Puerto Rico), and therefore can not represent Puerto Rico internationally or compete in the Winter Olympic Games. Although the Puerto Rican Figure Skating Federation became a member of the International Skating Union, the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee has not recognized it, nor is listed in the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee website. The Puerto Rican Figure Skating Federation is essentially a club seeking recognition by the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee. Created and formed by the family of the first Puerto Rican figure skater Kristine Stone Cruz (who trained in the Ice House in Hackensack New Jersey). She held the title 2 years in a row. Kristine is now coaching as well as skating in Omaha, Nebraska at the Ralston Arena.
Kay Thomson: Kay Thomson (born February 18, 1964) is a Canadian former figure skater who competed in ladies' singles. She is the 1981 Prize of Moscow News champion, the 1983 Skate Canada International silver medalist (behind that years Olympic and World Champion Katarina Witt), and a three-time Canadian national champion. Her rise to dominance of Canadian ladies figure skating was unexpected as young phenom Tracy Wainmann had been expected to dominate Canadian ladies skating throughout this quadrennial, and beyond, but Thomson dethroned Wainmann at the 1982 Canadian Championships, and was only challenged by rising future superstar Elizabeth Manley thereafter as Wainmann fell off the map for a few years with personal issues and a growth spurt. She represented Canada at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, placing 12th, and at three World Championships, achieving her best result, fifth, in 1984 (Ottawa). At this event she had perhaps her best shot ever of a world podium finish in a heavily weakened post Olympic field (missing amongst other Rosalynn Sumners, Tiffany Chin, Claudia Leistner, and Elena Vodorezova) and a respectable initial finish in compulsory figures which were never her strength, but a turn between her triple lutz-double toe combination in the short, and a miss on her triple flip in the long, was enough to keep her behind silver medalist Anna Kondrashova, bronze medalist Elaine Zayak, and 4th place finisher Kira Ivanova. The pro Canadian crowd however were not fully convinced, and booed the marks of each of Kondrashova, Ivanova, and young Japanese phenom Midori Ito (who was scored 4th best in the long program phase despite a fall and several glaring miscues), feeling Thomson and teammate Elizabeth Manley were unfairly scored. At the post event press conference Kondrashova would apologize to the fans for having not performed better, despite her silver medal.

""The Mountain 94.9"" had also carried the complete schedule of Red Sox Baseball (from 1997 through 2015, prior to becoming a Former Affiliate in 2016, which was when Millinocket's affiliation with the Red Sox Baseball would ultimately be transferred over to co-owned WSYY-AM, thus concluding the frequent interruptions to the music on ""The Mountain 94.9"" during Baseball season). The station currently features programming from CBS Radio and carries CBS Radio News at the top of every hour (and has been an affiliate of that network for many decades). Licensed to Millinocket, Maine, United States, the station's broadcast signal serves the Central Penobscot County, Eastern Piscataquis County, and Southern Aroostook County Maine areas, and the station is licensed to serve the town of Millinocket, Maine, the very town where its studios/offices and tower site are located. The station is currently owned by Katahdin Communications, Inc. WSYY-FM originally went on the air in 1978 on 97.7 FM as WKTR, upgrading to its current facilities in 1984 on 94.9. Prior to their ""The Mountain 94.9"" branding, WSYY-FM used to be referred to as ""North Country 95"", airing a full-time Country Music format. The current format, branding, and slogan was probably adopted around March 1, 2004, when Katahdin Communications, Inc. assumed control of WSYY-FM & WSYY-AM from Katahdin Timberlands, LLC (as a result of the radio station facing increasing land disputes), initially as a short term lease agreement but the transfer of ownership ultimately became permanent. Those same land disputes would eventually lead to a loss of WSYY-FM's 23,500 watt transmitter location (featuring an antenna HAAT of 211 meters); as a result, WSYY-FM may have been operating under a Special Temporary Authority License (a 12,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 68 meters via Hammond Ridge on Lake Road, about two miles from Millinocket Municipal Airport), ever since as long ago as late 2007, pending a planned permanent move to a 22,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 198.4 meters (from just off Nicatou Road in Medway, well east of WSYY-FM's old or current transmitter tower location). On November 23th, 2016, the CP for this proposed move was modified to a 45,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 146.7 meters, the first time this proposed move has ever received official approval from the FCC. WSYY-FM is one of the two Maine affiliates—apart from WLOB—of When Radio Was (7 days a week from 5:00AM through 6:00AM ET and also from 10:00PM through 11:00PM ET), is one of the two Maine affiliates (WWMJ) of The Acoustic Storm (Saturdays from 9:00AM through 12:00PM ET), is Maine's only affiliate of the Crook & Chase syndicated Country Music countdown programming (Sunday afternoons from 2:00PM through 6:00PM ET), and is an affiliate of the Blues Deluxe radio show. WSYY-FM/WSYY-AM are unusual in that while these stations are authorized to broadcast 24 hours a day, the stations both have sign-offs every day (WSYY-AM signing off at sun-down, broadcasting only on Weekends (but not between Monday-through-Friday) and WSYY-FM broadcasting for approximately 18¼ hours per day, 7 days a week, WSYY-FM's broadcast day concluding with the 11:00PM ET Top-of-the-Clock program will continue until 8:30pm EST; however it does NOT include any other programs available throughout North America including those featuring live shows such Assemblies Day Weekend Programs like This Is Not Happening To Me!

Indigenous Australians: Indigenous Australians are the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia, descended from groups that existed in Australia and surrounding islands prior to British colonisation. The time of arrival of the first Indigenous Australians is a matter of debate among researchers. The earliest definitely human remains found in Australia are those of Mungo Man LM3 and Mungo Lady, which have been dated to around 50,000 years BP. Recent archaeological evidence from the analysis of charcoal and artifacts revealing human use has pushed this date back further to around 65,000 B.P. Luminescence dating has suggested habitation in Arnhem Land as far back as 60,000 years BP. Genetic research has inferred a date of habitation as early as 80,000 years BP.
Jamaican patty: A Jamaican patty is a pastry that contains various fillings and spices baked inside a flaky shell, often tinted golden yellow with an egg yolk mixture or turmeric. It is made like a turnover but is more savoury.

Context: Megalurus: Megalurus is a genus of passerine bird in the family Locustellidae. The genus was once placed in the Old World warbler ""wastebin"" family Sylviidae. The genus contains six species also known as the typical grassbirds. The genus is distributed from northern China and Japan, to India in the west, and Australia in the south, with most species being located wholly or partly in the tropics. The genus is also sometimes considered to include the genus ""Bowdleria"", which holds the fernbirds of New Zealand. The most widespread species, the tawny grassbird, ranges from the Philippines to southern New South Wales, whereas the Fly River grassbird is restricted to swampland in the southern part of New Guinea. The natural habitat of the typical grassbirds is, as the name suggests, wet grasslands, swamps and other marshlands. Some species exist away from water in tall grasslands, heathlands, and forest clearings. Some species have adapted to the margins of rice fields and gardens.
Ceratozamia: Ceratozamia is a genus of New World cycads in the family Zamiaceae. The genus contains 27 known currently living species and one or two fossil species. Most species are endemic to mountainous areas of Mexico, while few species extend into the mountains of Guatemala, Honduras and Belize. The genus name comes from the Greek ""ceras"", meaning horn, which refers to the paired, spreading horny projections on the male and female sporophylls of all species.
Banksiamyces: Banksiamyces is a genus of fungi in the order Helotiales, with a tentative placement in the family Helotiaceae. The genus contains four species, which grow on the seed follicles of the dead infructescences or ""cones"" of various species of ""Banksia"", a genus in the plant family Proteaceae endemic to Australia. Fruit bodies of the fungus appear as small (typically less than 10 mm diameter), shallow dark cups on the follicles of the ""Banksia"" fruit. The edges of dry fruit bodies fold inwards, appearing like narrow slits. The first specimens of ""Banksiamyces"", known then as ""Tympanis toomansis"", were described in 1887. Specimens continued to be collected occasionally for almost 100 years before becoming examined more critically in the early 1980s, leading to the creation of a new genus to contain what was determined to be three distinct species, ""B. katerinae"", ""B. macrocarpus"", and ""B. toomansis"". A fourth species, ""B. maccannii"", was added in 1984.
Calyptocephalellidae: The Calyptocephalellidae are a family of toads found in Chile containing two genera, ""Calyptocephalella"" and ""Telmatobufo"".

The ""Telmatobufo"" genus contains four species, ""T. australis"", ""T. bullocki"", ""T. ignotus"", and ""T. venustus"". All species within the family are considered threatened, with ""T. bullocki"" and ""T. venustus"" being classified as critically endangered.
Lophodermium: Lophodermium is a genus of fungi within the family Rhytismataceae. The genus contains 145 species and has a global distribution. Species of this genus are usually observed producing zone lines, conidiomata and ascomata on dead fallen leaves, but at least some are known to colonize living leaves. In many cases they then live inside the colonized leaf as a symptomless endobiont, where they are regarded as detritivores utilising dead plant matter. In a few cases they may kill all or part of the leaf prematurely, and there is a substantial literature dealing with those species as plant pathogens. The genus infects many different plant families but with a notable concentration in the family Pinaceae; many ""Lophodermium"" species are restricted to a single host genus (or even species), but some, particularly those infecting grasses, may infect several generations such that it can cause disease by killing off plants rather quickly if not immediately infected.[1] These types of infections occur when young adults die due either directly to their own death caused through exposure via direct contact between soil-based organisms,[2][3].

He is most famous for his 1885 English translation of Miguel de Cervantes' ""Don Quixote de la Mancha"", perhaps the most scholarly and accurate English translation of the novel up to that time. It is so precise that Samuel Putnam, who published his own English translation of the novel in 1949, faults Ormsby for duplicating Cervantes' pronouns so closely that the meaning of the sentences sometimes becomes confusing.
Emphatic Diaglott: The Emphatic Diaglott is a diaglot, or two-language polyglot translation, of the New Testament by Benjamin Wilson, first published in 1864.

Context: WWE One Night Stand: WWE One Night Stand was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event, produced every June by WWE, a professional wrestling promotion based in Connecticut. The event was created in 2005, with its inaugural event taking place in June of that year. The event's name refers to its original format, that being a one night reunion show for former Extreme Championship Wrestling alumni. The first two shows were promoted under the ECW acronym; this however was changed for the 2007 and 2008 events. As WWE launched their own version of ECW in 2006, these two shows were promoted under the WWE acronym. The final event under the One Night Stand name was in 2008 before being renamed to Extreme Rules in 2009. This event was noted by WWE to be a direct continuation of the One Night Stand chronology. However, the 2010 event was later promoted as only the second event under a new chronology, one that is no longer a direct continuation of the One Night Stand event.
Impact One Night Only: Impact: One Night Only is a series of professional wrestling events held by Impact Wrestling (formerly known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA)).

Promoted as individual ""specials"", the events—unlike the live pay-per-view events—are not connected to the storylines featured on TNA's weekly television programming nor to each other, though later One Night Only events still incorporated storylines into matches and situations. The concept was announced on January 11, 2013 by Impact President Dixie Carter as a part of a change to their pay-per-view programming. Prior to the change, Impact Wrestling held live pay-per-view events monthly. Jeremy Borash and Josh Mathews handle commentary duties.

Le donne rivali: Le donne rivali is an intermezzo in two acts by composer Domenico Cimarosa with an Italian libretto by a now unknown poet. It is speculated that Giuseppe Petrosellini may have been the author of the libretto. The opera premiered at the Teatro Valle in Rome during Carnival in 1780. The original choreography was created by Alberto Cavos, the original costumes by Antonio Dian, and the original scenery by Domenico Fossati. Music critics particularly admire the final quintet that closes the opera. In recent years, ""Le donne rivali"" has been occasionally revived and recorded. In 1991, the Juilliard Opera Center intertwined the work with Mozart's unfinished opera ""Lo sposo deluso"", which shares the same libretto, to make one large work.
Don Pasquale: Don Pasquale (] ) is an opera buffa, or comic opera, in three acts by Gaetano Donizetti with an Italian libretto completed largely by Giovanni Ruffini as well as the composer. It was based on a libretto by Angelo Anelli for Stefano Pavesi's opera ""Ser Marcantonio"" written in 1810 but, on the published libretto, the author appears as ""M.A.""
Amica (opera): Amica is an opera in two acts by Pietro Mascagni, originally composed to a libretto by Paul Bérel (the pseudonym of Paul de Choudens). The only opera by Mascagni with a French libretto, it was an immediate success with both the audience and the critics on its opening night at the Théâtre du Casino in Monte-Carlo on 16 March 1905. Mascagni himself conducted the performance. The opera had its Italian premiere (with an Italian libretto by Mascagni's close collaborator, Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti) on 13 May 1905 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome.
Partenope (Zumaya): Partenope is an opera in three acts by Manuel de Zumaya. Zumaya adapted the libretto himself from a Spanish translation of Silvio Stampiglia's Italian libretto which was first set for performance in Naples during 1699 with music by Luigi Mancia. All told, Stampiglia's libretto was used by a variety of composers for more than a dozen operas that were produced all over Italy, including versions by Leonardo Vinci and George Frideric Handel. Zumaya's version was commissioned by Viceroy Fernando de Alencastre Noroña y Silva and produced at the viceroyal palace in Mexico City on 1 May 1711. The production is the earliest known full opera produced in North America and the first opera written by an American-born composer. However, ""Parténope"" is not the earliest opera to be performed in the New World, as some sources have reported. That distinction belongs to Tomás de Torrejón y Velasco's ""La púrpura de la rosa"", which premiered ten years earlier in Lima, Peru.

111,"Answer the following to the best of your ability. You must provide an answer. If you are unsure, make an educated guess based on what you know and the context provided. Context: Cypress-pine: Cypress-pine is the common name used for three closely related genera of conifers in the cypress family Cupressaceae:
Fokienia: Fokienia is a genus of conifer tree belonging to the cypress family. In its characteristics, ""Fokienia"" is intermediate between the genera of ""Chamaecyparis"" and ""Calocedrus"". Genetically ""Fokienia"" is much closer to ""Chamaecyparis"", and not all researchers recognize ""Fokienia"" as a separate genus. The genus comprises only one living species, Fokienia hodginsii or Fujian cypress (; Vietnamese: ""Pơmu"" ), and one fossil species (""Fokienia ravenscragensis"").
Cupressaceae: Cupressaceae is a conifer family, the cypress family, with worldwide distribution. The family includes 27–30 genera (17 monotypic), which include the junipers and redwoods, with about 130–140 species in total. They are monoecious, subdioecious or (rarely) dioecious trees and shrubs 1 – tall. The bark of mature trees is commonly orange- to red- brown and of stringy texture, often flaking or peeling in vertical strips, but smooth, scaly or hard and square-cracked in some species.
Cupressus: The genus Cupressus is one of several genera within the family Cupressaceae that have the common name cypress; for the others, see cypress. It is considered a polyphyletic group. Based on genetic and morphological analysis, the ""Cupressus"" genus is found in the Cupressoideae subfamily. The common name comes from Old French ""cipres"" and that from Latin ""cyparissus"", which is the latinisation of the Greek κυπάρισσος (""kypárissos"").
Pilgerodendron: Pilgerodendron is a genus of conifer belonging to the cypress family Cupressaceae. It has only one species, Pilgerodendron uviferum, and is endemic to the Valdivian temperate rain forests and Magellanic subpolar forests of southern Chile and southwestern Argentina. It grows from 40 to 55°S in Tierra del Fuego, where it is the southernmost conifer in the world. It is a member of subfamily Callitroideae, a group of distinct southern hemisphere genera associated with the Antarctic flora.
Frenchman Formation: The Frenchman Formation is stratigraphic unit of Late Cretaceous (late Maastrichtian) age in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. It is present in southern Saskatchewan and the Cypress Hills of southeastern Alberta. The formation was defined by G.M. Furnival in 1942 from observations of outcrops along the Frenchman River, between Ravenscrag and Highway 37. It contains the youngest of dinosaur genera, much like the Hell Creek Formation in the United States.
Libocedrus: Libocedrus is a genus of five species of coniferous trees in the cypress family Cupressaceae, native to New Zealand and New Caledonia. The genus is closely related to the South American genera ""Pilgerodendron"" and ""Austrocedrus"", and the New Guinean genus ""Papuacedrus"", both of which are included within ""Libocedrus"" by some botanists. These genera are rather similar to the Northern Hemisphere genera ""Calocedrus"" and ""Thuja"": in earlier days, what is now ""Calocedrus"" was sometimes included in ""Libocedrus"". They are much less closely related, as recently confirmed (Gadek et al. 2000). The generic name means ""teardrop cedar"", apparently referring to drops of resin.
Ajugeae: Ajugeae is a tribe of the Teucrioideae subfamily of the family Lamiaceae and might contain the genera ""Acrymia"" , ""Ajuga"" , ""Cymaria"" , ""Garrettia"" , ""Holocheila"" .

112,"Answer the following to the best of your ability. You must provide an answer. If you are unsure, make an educated guess based on what you know and the context provided. Context: Birth tourism: Birth tourism is travel to another country for the purpose of giving birth in that country. "" Anchor baby"" is another related term which can have negative connotations. The main reason for birth tourism is to obtain citizenship for the child in a country with birthright citizenship (""jus soli""). Other reasons include access to public schooling, healthcare, sponsorship for the parents in the future, or even circumvention of China's two-child policy. Popular destinations include the United States and Canada. Another target for birth tourism is Hong Kong, where mainland Chinese citizens travel to give birth to gain right of abode for their children.
Birth certificate: A birth certificate is a vital record that documents the birth of a child. The term ""birth certificate"" can refer to either the original document certifying the circumstances of the birth or to a certified copy of or representation of the ensuing registration of that birth. Depending on the jurisdiction, a record of birth might or might not contain verification of the event by such as a midwife or doctor.
Place of birth: The place of birth (POB) is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be country that currently has ""sovereignty"" over the actual place of birth regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.

In addition, the town's cemetery holds a marker to the event paid for in large part by Bishoff and the Pierce City Museum hosts an exhibit which Bishoff created. He has also publicly spoken about the event to CNN and appears in a documentary about the event, ""Banished: How Whites Drove Blacks out of Town in America"".
West African Ebola virus epidemic: The West African Ebola virus epidemic (2013–2016) was the most widespread outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in history—causing major loss of life and socioeconomic disruption in the region, mainly in the countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The first cases were recorded in Guinea in December 2013; later, the disease spread to neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone, with minor outbreaks occurring elsewhere. It caused significant mortality, with the case fatality rate reported at slightly above 70%, while the rate among hospitalized patients was 57–59%. Small outbreaks occurred in Nigeria and Mali, and isolated cases were recorded in Senegal, the United Kingdom and Sardinia. In addition, imported cases led to secondary infection of medical workers in the United States and Spain but did not spread further. The number of cases peaked in October 2014 and then began to decline gradually, following the commitment of substantial international resources. <section begin=casesasof />s of 08 2016 <section end=casesasof />, the World Health Organization (WHO) and respective governments reported a total of <section begin=cases />28,616<section end=cases /> suspected cases and <section begin=deaths />11,310<section end=deaths /> deaths<sections end =death>14</subtitle></div><br/>",1991,0,0.0,0.7653376999951433,0.00020832118055469535,6.116738797844982e-05,0.0671106000081636,1.8245723888927993e-05,5.357320216264367e-06

Guggenheim Museum in New York. The north wing of the house was designed by Taliesin Associates and built in 1967. It was originally the carport, which was enclosed for a playroom. The present carport on the front and an extension of the shop was added at the same time.
A. H. Bulbulian Residence: The A. H. Bulbulian Residence is a house located at 1229 Skyline Drive, Rochester, Minnesota, United States. It was designed by noted architect Frank Lloyd Wright for Arthur H. Bulbulian, a pioneer in the field of facial prosthetics. It is down the street from the Thomas Keys House and not far from the James McBean Residence, all three examples of Wright's Usonian genre of architecture. The Bulbulian Residence is a one-story house built with one 120-degree angle, and is constructed of cement brick and cypress. The house has recently been restored to near-original condition.
Theodore A. Pappas House: The Theodore A. Pappas House is a Frank Lloyd Wright designed Usonian house in St. Louis, Missouri. The Pappas house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, when it was only 15 years old. It is one of two houses in St. Louis designed by Wright, the only Usonian Automatic in Missouri. Wright designed it between 1955 and 1959 at the Pappas’ request, and Theodore and Bette Pappas built the house together with the help of day laborers between 1960 and 1964. The Pappas house is a rambling four-bedroom house, and after the Gerald B. and Beverley Tonkens House, is the largest of the Usonian Automatics built.
Gildersleeve House: The Gildersleeve House was a house located at 108 Broadway in Hudson, Illinois. Settler James T. Gildersleeve built the Greek Revival house for his family in 1836. Gildersleeve founded the village of Hudson and named it after the area of New York where he formerly lived. The house was the village's first frame house and was its finest home in its early years; as a result, it hosted local events and was the village's first post office. Gildersleeve planted five oak trees outside the house; the trees grew together at their base, giving the house the name ""Five Oaks"". The house was demolished in 2000.
Lloyd Lewis House: The Lloyd Lewis House in Libertyville, Illinois is a Usonian house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and built in 1939. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The client for this house was the editor of the Chicago Daily News. This is a two-story house located near the Des Plaines River.
Robert H. Sunday House: The Robert H. Sunday House is located in Marshalltown, Iowa, United States. It was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the Usonian style, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Initially the Sunday's choose the Usonian Automatic, a natural concrete block model, for their home. When it provided unworkable, Wright sent the plans for this house. In style and materials it is very similar to the 1953 Usonian Exhibition House. It was the sixth of seven houses designed by Wright and built in this style in Iowa. Sunday, who owned Marshall Lumber in Marshalltown, acted as his own general contractor. In fact, he and his wife did much of the work themselves. It is also believed to be last of this style built in brick. John H. Howe, a Wright assistant who supervised the initial construction, designed an addition to this house in 1970 that conforms seamlessly with the original. It includes the family room, family room terrace, and the dining room. The original house followed an ""L"" shaped plan, and with the addition it is now a ""T"" shaped plan. Howe had previously designed (1964) the building for William E., but never completed or finished yet.[1]",Amberley Village,0,0.0026666666666666666,0.7992039999953704,0.00021753610777547387,6.387308034734721e-05,0.1258635999984108,3.424094444425362e-05,1.0053846315546911e-05

Context: Violin Sonata No. 2 (Prokofiev): Sergei Prokofiev's Violin Sonata No. 2 in D Major, Op. 94a (sometimes written as Op. 94bis), was based on the composer's own Flute Sonata in D, Op. 94, written in 1942 but arranged for violin in 1943 when Prokofiev was living in Perm in the Ural Mountains, a remote shelter for Soviet artists during the Second World War. Prokofiev transformed the work into a violin sonata at the prompting of his close friend violinist David Oistrakh. It was premiered on 17 June 1944 by David Oistrakh and Lev Oborin.
Flute Sonata (Prokofiev): The Flute Sonata in D, Op. 94, was completed in the summer of 1943 by Sergei Prokofiev. At that same time, Prokofiev was working on music for ""Ivan the terrible"". The flute sonata in D was first performed in Moscow, Russia on December 7, 1943 by Nicolai Kharkovsky (flute) and Sviatoslav Richter (piano). It was later transcribed for violin in 1944, by the composer with the help of violinist David Oistrakh, as Op. 94a.
