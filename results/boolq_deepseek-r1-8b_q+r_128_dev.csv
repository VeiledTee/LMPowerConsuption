2,"False. The context states that Terius Nash conceptualized the song after Beyoncé's secret marriage to Jay-Z in April 2008 and that during recording she remained tightlipped even about wearing a wedding band. However it does not specify when the song was released but since her marriage was kept secret until after the song's release (as indicated by her public silence) the question is asking if she was married at the time of release. The context implies that the marriage occurred before or during the creation of the song and given its themes it suggests the marriage happened prior to the album's release in December 2008. Therefore yes she was married when ""Single Ladies"" was released. Wait no: the question is ""was Beyonce married when single ladies was released?"" The context says her secret marriage occurred in April 2008 and the song was recorded that month or shortly after (May 2008). The album containing ""Single Ladies"" was released on December 9 2008. So she was indeed married at the time of release. But my initial answer is False? That can't be right.  Let's re-read: Nash conceptualized it after her secret marriage in April 2008. The song was recorded in May 2008 and released later that year (December). Her marriage to Jay-Z was publicized around the time of the album release but she had been married since April without publicizing it until then. So when ""Single Ladies"" was released on December 9 2008 Beyoncé was already married. Therefore the answer should be True.  But my first thought: I said False because I misread or confused something. Let me correct that. The context clearly states her marriage inspired Nash and is referenced in the song's theme about commitment. Since the song addresses this issue and she was silent but married during recording it confirms she was married at release time. So answer is True.  But wait: the question says ""was Beyonce married when single ladies was released"". The context doesn't explicitly say the release date but from the information given (recording in May 2008 marriage in April) and knowing the album came out later that year it's safe to assume she was married. However strictly based on the provided context: ""Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008... Nash conceptualized 'Single Ladies' after Beyoncé's secret marriage..."" So at the time of recording (May) she had been married since April but kept it secret until later. The release is not specified but typically songs are released soon after recording. Given that the album was a holiday one and came out in December ""Single Ladies"" was likely part of that cycle.  But to be precise: the context doesn't mention the release date directly only that it was recorded in May 2008 and mixed later. However since her marriage inspired Nash and she kept it secret until recording (as per being tightlipped) but by December 2008 when the album came out Jay-Z's marriage to Beyoncé was widely publicized. So yes at release time she was married.  Therefore answer is True. </think> True",True,True,1,1.0,6.2374500000005355,0.002174799631925177,0.0006385659514176503,0.0528005000014673,1.4059237222338399e-05,4.128081530500203e-06

101,"False. The context describes a ""gun show loophole"" which allows private sales of firearms without requiring background checks as long as the seller does not know the buyer is prohibited.

104,"False  Explanation: The context states that a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) named National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited was set up by the Ministry of Railways in January 2016 and it was registered under Indian Railways. However it also mentions that this SPV was planned to be made into a joint venture with equity participation from Maharashtra and Gujarat governments. The question claims ""Indian railways forms spv"" but does not specify the involvement or ownership structure beyond the initial setup by Ministry of Railways. Since the context indicates it's initially a public sector company under Indian Railways but later intended for a joint venture involving state governments the statement is incomplete without mentioning this detail. However strictly speaking the SPV was indeed formed by Indian Railways (as per Ministry) so one might think ""True"". But note: The question says ""forms spv to execute"" and while it's true that an SPV was formed the execution part involves more than just forming; there are plans for a joint venture. Also the context does not explicitly say Indian Railways forms the SPV—it says Ministry of Railways sets up the SPV named National High-Speed Rail Corporation Limited under Indian Railways' name. The question might be interpreted as the SPV being formed solely by Indian Railways without state involvement initially or in general but the context shows it's a tripartite effort later on and involves state governments. However upon closer reading: ""the company was registered in January 2016 in the name of Indian Railways"" — so technically yes an SPV (NHSRC) was formed by Indian Railways to execute the project. But wait let's check the question again: It says ""indian railways forms spv"". In government terms often ministries act on behalf or with state entities. The context indicates that while initially set up as a public sector vehicle under IR it was planned for conversion into a joint venture involving states. So perhaps the answer should be True because an SPV *was* formed by Indian Railways (the Ministry). But note: The question does not mention any other party or specify the exact nature of formation beyond what's in context? Let me re-examine.  The context says: ""In January 2016 the Ministry of Railways fast tracked the project and set up a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) named the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited to build and operate the corridor. The company was registered in January 2016 in the name of Indian Railways.""  So yes an SPV *was* formed by registering it under Indian Railways' name.  But then: ""It was planned for the company to eventually be made into a joint venture with equity participation of the Maharashtra and Gujarat governments."" This implies that initially it's not just Indian Railways but later involves states. However the question is about forming an SPV specifically for Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project.  The context does mention this project (the corridor) which is likely referring to the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Corridor.  So: The statement says ""Indian railways forms spv"" — but in reality it was formed by Ministry of Railways under Indian Railways' name. However since Indian Railways and Ministry are often used interchangeably or as part of each other (Ministry is the parent body) one might say True.  But wait: The question says ""indian railways forms spv"" which could be interpreted as IR forming it directly. In fact the SPV was registered in the name of Indian Railways so technically yes.  However note that the context also mentions a tripartite consultancy agreement later on with JICA and two other companies. But that doesn't change the formation part.  But let's look at the exact wording: The question is ""indian railways forms spv to execute mumbai-ahmedabad bullet train project"". From context we know an SPV was formed (NHSRC) by Ministry of Railways and registered under IR. So it *is* true that Indian Railways has an SPV for this project.  But wait: The question says ""forms spv"" which is past tense. And the context confirms that indeed such a vehicle exists now or existed then? It was formed in 2016 so present as well.  However there's a nuance: The SPV was initially planned to be later converted into a joint venture with state governments' equity participation. But at formation (January 2016) it was not yet that. So the statement ""forms spv"" is true even if ownership changes later? Yes because forming an SPV doesn't necessarily mean permanent ownership.  But note: The question does not specify when or how the SPV is formed beyond what's in context. Since the context says Ministry of Railways set up the SPV and it was registered under Indian Railways we can say that Indian Railways (as a name) forms an SPV for this project? Or more accurately the Ministry does.  But let's see: The answer should be based on whether ""indian railways"" is responsible for forming the SPV. In government parlance often ministries are referred to as part of IR or by their names. However strictly speaking Indian Railways is a service organization under the Ministry and the SPV was set up by the ministry.  But wait: The context says ""The company was registered in January 2016 in the name of Indian Railways."" So it's associated with IR.  However upon closer inspection I think there might be confusion. Let me check again:  - Ministry sets up SPV. - Company is registered under Indian Railways' name.  So while technically formed by the ministry it operates under IR and is part of the project execution for Mumbai-Ahmedabad line.  But note: The question says ""indian railways forms spv"" which might be a bit loose in language. However since the SPV was registered in the name of Indian Railways one could say that Indian Railways *forms* it or is involved in its formation.  Moreover the context does not contradict this; it supports that an SPV exists for the project under IR's umbrella.  But wait: The question might be testing if we know that the actual implementation involves more than just IR. However based on the information given ""Indian railways forms spv"" is true because the company was registered in its name and tasked with execution.  However let me consider the possibility of a trick: Is there any other SPV mentioned? No only this one for the project.  But note: The context says that initially it's public sector (under IR) but planned to be joint venture. So at formation yes Indian Railways is involved as owner or operator.  Therefore I think the answer should be True.  But wait a second: Let me read the question carefully again.  ""indian railways forms spv to execute mumbai-ahmed-a bullet train project""  The context says that an SPV was formed by Ministry of Railways (which is part of Indian Railways system) and registered under IR. So it's accurate to say Indian Railways forms this SPV even though technically the ministry did.  In common parlance we might say ""Indian Railways"" when referring to such projects.  Moreover there's no information in context that says otherwise; it confirms an SPV was formed for the project under IR's name.  So I think True is correct.",True,True,1,1.0,13.857854300000326,0.004916088889661008,0.0014434649210884757,0.0222061999993457,5.702748888688802e-06,1.6744444942626328e-06
