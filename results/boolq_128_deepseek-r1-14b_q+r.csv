8,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the UEFA Champions League Final is just one game. Let me think about what I know. The context provided mentions that the 2018 final was played between Real Madrid and Liverpool on May 26 2018 at a specific stadium in Kiev. It also talks about it being the final match of that season's competition.  From my general knowledge the Champions League is a knockout tournament where teams play multiple matches against each other to advance through different stages like group stages round of 16 quarterfinals and semifinals. The final is indeed the last game determining the champion for that season. So yes the final is just one match deciding the winner after all the previous rounds.  I don't think there's any scenario where the final isn't a single game; it's always the decisive match to crown the champion. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,7.541451500001131,0.002388606437968579,0.0007013440319895212,0.04032579998602159,1.0899906413605402e-05,3.200436953911876e-06
2,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the days get longer or shorter at the equator based on the provided context. Let me read the context again carefully.  The context says that at the Equator the daytime length remains 12 hours all year round. It then explains that at other latitudes the duration varies with the seasons—shorter in winter and longer in summer. It also mentions that northern winter coincides with southern summer and vice versa.  So focusing on the equator specifically: it clearly states that the daytime is always 12 hours there regardless of the season. That means whether it's summer or winter elsewhere at the equator days don't change in length. They stay exactly at 12 hours.  The question is asking if the days get longer and shorter at the equator. Based on the context since the duration remains constant the answer should be False because there's no variation—days aren't getting longer or shorter; they're always the same. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,7.956486699986272,0.0025334222937923945,0.0007438649490418364,0.027247499994700775,6.920893887581768e-06,2.0321169477447755e-06
7,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Air Force One typically flies with fighter escorts. The context says that usually the Air Force doesn't have fighter aircraft escorting the presidential plane over the U.S. but it has happened in specific cases like during the attack on the World Trade Center.  Hmm so normally no but sometimes yes. So when someone asks if Air Force One flies with fighter escorts the answer depends on whether it's a usual occurrence or not. Since the context specifies that it's not usual but has occurred I think the correct answer is False because it doesn't typically do that. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,10.179582299984759,0.0033253383853465283,0.0009763878192055418,0.022095599997555837,5.573088890297287e-06,1.6363736490140541e-06
3,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's ever been a Duke of Sussex before based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that the dukedom was first conferred on 24 November 1801 upon Prince Augustus Frederick who was the sixth son of King George III. He was made Baron Arklow and Earl of Inverness at the same time also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. So he received multiple titles including Duke.  Then it mentions that the title became extinct upon his death in 1843. Extinct means it ended so after Prince Augustus Frederick died there were no more Dukes of Sussex from his line.  It also talks about his children: he had a son and daughter with Lady Augusta Murray but their marriage was annulled because they didn't get royal permission under the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Because of this the children were considered illegitimate under English law and couldn't inherit titles from their father.  Both of these children died without having any kids themselves so there's no one left in that line to inherit the title. Therefore since Prince Augustus Frederick was the first and only Duke of Sussex and his line ended with him there hasn't been another Duke of Sussex after him.  So putting it all together: Yes there has been a Duke of Sussex before specifically Prince Augustus Frederick who was the first and only holder of that title until it became extinct in 1843. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,13.424724799988326,0.004451478662072463,0.0013070457918669853,0.010308299999451265,2.2864149964233445e-06,6.713385206131431e-07
6,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if ""Pokémon Let's Go Eevee!"" is considered a spin-off. First I remember that the context says these games are enhanced remakes of Pokémon Yellow from 1998. Spin-offs usually refer to games that branch off from the main series but aren't direct sequels or reboots.  The context also mentions they're part of the main series for Switch so maybe they're not spin-offs but more like updated versions. Plus they integrate with Pokémon Go which is a different game but not necessarily making them spin-offs. So I think it's False because they are main series games rather than spin-offs. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,16.02542810002342,0.005360610583383277,0.0015739856431405898,0.018333000014536083,4.491600000377123e-06,1.3188262428982307e-06
9,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the dog from The Little Rascals is still alive. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context mentions Pete the Pup who was part of Hal Roach's Our Gang comedies later known as The Little Rascals during the 1930s. There are two mentions of dates: the original Pete from 1924 to June 1930 and the second Pete from September 9 1929 to January 28 1946.  Wait that's a bit confusing because the first mention says 1924–June 1930 but then the second is 1929–1946. Maybe there were two different dogs playing Pete? The original was an APBT named Pal the Wonder Dog and he had a natural ring around his eye which was enhanced with dye.  So the first Pete's lifespan is from 1924 to June 1930 meaning he died in 1930. The second Pete started in September 1929 but lived longer until January 28 1946. So that dog would have been alive until 1946.  But the question is about whether the dog from Little Rascals is still alive today. Since both dates are in the past (1930 and 1946) neither of them could be alive now. Dogs don't live that long especially considering they were used in films during the early 20th century.  Therefore the answer should be False because both dogs have passed away a long time ago. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,16.873037500015926,0.0056534272325695365,0.0016599626404849525,0.01869910000823438,4.605487776603291e-06,1.3522660389663979e-06
12,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Meredith has a baby in Grey's Anatomy based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that Meredith moves to her completed dream home and sells her house to Alex. Alex buys it as his only true home ever and continues Meredith's tradition of helping strays. Then Meredith discovers she is pregnant and gives birth to a son. The baby was delivered via C-section. During the operation the obstetrician had to leave so an intern named Shane Ross finished stitching her up. After that blood started appearing everywhere leading Meredith to diagnose herself with DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation). Dr. Bailey then performed a spleen removal to save her life and as a result Derek and Meredith named their son Bailey.  So putting this together the context clearly states that Meredith gave birth to a son. Therefore yes she does have a baby in Grey's Anatomy. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,19.82824549995712,0.006693969961933948,0.0019654874107733833,0.016140099993208423,3.9827044450147595e-06,1.1694040296001176e-06
0,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Johnson & Wales University (JWU) is a for-profit school based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that JWU is an American private nonprofit co-educational career-oriented university. It mentions that it has one main campus in Providence Rhode Island and three branch campuses across the U.S. The university was founded in 1914 by Gertrude I. Johnson and Mary T. Wales as a business school. Currently there are 15 063 students enrolled in various programs.  The key point here is that it's described as a ""nonprofit"" institution. For-profit schools typically aim to make money for their owners or shareholders whereas nonprofit schools have a different structure where any surplus funds are reinvested into the organization rather than distributed to owners. Since JWU is explicitly stated to be nonprofit that indicates it isn't operated with the goal of generating profit.  I don't see any other information in the context suggesting it's for-profit. It also mentions being a university which usually implies an educational institution rather than a business entity focused on profits. Therefore based on this context JWU is not a for-profit school. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,21.667904100002488,0.007343527067623544,0.002156210751492177,0.041310800006613135,1.0769051108218263e-05,3.1620151419178133e-06

The context describes a series of events involving several characters including Wyatt Hope Liam and others. It mentions that after some conflicts and misunderstandings Hope marries Wyatt on Bill's yacht. The story goes on to talk about subsequent events like her pregnancy miscarriage and eventual divorce from Wyatt.  From this it's clear that at least in the storyline provided Hope and Wyatt got married during the events described.

5,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Glenn died in The Walking Dead season 6. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show and then check the context provided.  From what I remember Glenn was a main character who was killed in a later season. But I'm not exactly sure when that happened. The context given talks about the seventh season premiere where Negan kills Abraham and then beats Glenn to death with his baseball bat Lucille. It mentions that after two blows Glenn is severely injured and says something before being bludgeoned further.  So in the context provided it's clear that Glenn dies in the seventh season. The question is asking about season 6. I know that season 6 ended with some major events but I don't recall Glenn dying then. He was still alive at the end of season 6 as far as I remember.  Therefore based on the context and my memory Glenn did not die in season 6; he died later in season 7. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,26.16525379999075,0.008934649151132944,0.0026233969566776165,0.022331699990900233,5.615630551538844e-06,1.6488647566944222e-06
11,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether anyone has climbed the North Face of Everest based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that The North Face is the northern side of Mount Everest. It mentions that George Mallory's body was found there which suggests he attempted or was involved in climbing it. Also an author or climber noted that ""a simple slip would mean death "" indicating it's a dangerous route.  Now the question is asking if anyone has climbed the North Face of Everest. From what I know outside this context I recall that the North Face is one of the more challenging routes on Everest and that many climbers have attempted it over the years. However based solely on the provided context there's no explicit mention of someone successfully climbing it.  The context talks about Mallory's body being found which might imply he didn't survive his attempt but it doesn't confirm whether he reached the summit or not. There's also a quote about the danger but that doesn't answer if anyone has climbed it.  So considering only the given information there's no direct statement that someone has successfully climbed the North Face. Therefore I can't definitively say 'True' based on this context alone. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,26.46405630002846,0.009028135535237621,0.0026508464839508734,0.06915560000925325,1.8723221441997572e-05,5.4975233295992535e-06
13,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the World Cup has ever been won through penalty shoot-outs based on the given context. Let me read the context carefully.  The context says that penalty shoot-outs were introduced in 1978 but didn't happen before 1982. Then it mentions that the first time a World Cup title was won by penalties was in 1994 and only another time in 2006. So from this I can see that yes there have been instances where the World Cup was decided via penalties.  The question is asking if the World Cup has been won on penalties. Since the context explicitly states that it happened in 1994 and 2006 the answer should be True. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,29.26235799997812,0.010016828901447665,0.0029411472136302123,0.03387239997391589,8.822088959775225e-06,2.590346966862018e-06
14,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" was written specifically for Top Gun. Let me start by recalling what I know about the song and the movie.  I remember that ""Danger Zone"" is a iconic song from Top Gun but I'm not sure if it's originally written for the movie or if it was an existing song they used. The context provided mentions that Jerry Bruckheimer Don Simpson and Michael Dilbeck had over 300 songs to choose from but weren't satisfied with any of them. They then asked Giorgio Moroder to write something new.  So according to the context Moroder worked with Tom Whitlock to compose ""Danger Zone"" and had Joe Pizzullo record a demo. The producers approved and Columbia Records wanted it performed by an artist on their label. That suggests that ""Danger Zone"" was created specifically for Top Gun because they weren't happy with existing songs.  Wait but the question is about ""Highway to the Danger Zone."" Hmm I think there's another song called ""Highway to the Danger Zone "" which might be a different version or perhaps a cover. But in the context provided it only mentions ""Danger Zone"" being composed for Top Gun. There's no mention of ""Highway to the Danger Zone.""  So based on the given context they wrote ""Danger Zone"" specifically for the movie. If ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" is another song perhaps a cover or a different version then it wasn't written for Top Gun. But since the context doesn't mention that specific title I can only go by what's provided.  Therefore the answer should be False because the context talks about composing ""Danger Zone "" not ""Highway to the Danger Zone."" </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,32.98872059999849,0.011312937158731336,0.0033217112850522615,0.04381060000741854,1.1604192921133224e-05,3.4072299738978155e-06
18,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Leslie Knope wins the city council election based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context starts by saying that Bobby is declared the winner with a small margin of victory. Ben mentions that this margin is low enough to trigger an automatic recount. So initially it looks like Bobby might win but then there's a recount.  Leslie goes missing and Ron finds her in the city council chambers. She feels bad about letting her friends down because they worked hard for her campaign. Ron explains that he and the parks department supported her not just for winning but because they care about her and her dream. Leslie then tells Ben to accept the job which I think refers to the position she was running for.  The recount happens and it's official: Leslie has won. This leads to her overwhelmed jubilation and relief from Jerry and Bobby. So after the recount Leslie is declared the winner.  Looking at the rest of the context there are other details about Ben accepting a job offer Ron turning down a position Jean-Ralphio asking for a job but being turned down Leslie giving a heartfelt speech and some personal stuff with Ann and Tom. But all that doesn't change the main point about the election.  So putting it together: Initially Bobby was declared the winner but after the recount Leslie wins. Therefore yes Leslie Knope does win the city council election. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,34.90082199999597,0.011983096800387958,0.0035184839545406,0.03518649999750778,9.13573611049085e-06,2.682440228358877e-06

The context mentions that Case Histories is a British crime drama TV series based on Kate Atkinson's novel series. It stars Jason Isaacs and was set and filmed in Edinburgh. The first series premiered in June 2011 on BBC1 and later on PBS in the US in October 2011.  Then it says that a second series aired in 2013. That already answers the question but I should check more details to be thorough. It mentions that initially it was commissioned as two feature-length episodes. However in September 2012 the BBC reported that the format for series two would change to three self-contained stories each ninety minutes long.  Additionally filming for the second series started in October 2012 and the first episode adapted Atkinson's novel ""Started Early Took My Dog."" The next two episodes were original TV stories. So all this confirms that a second season was indeed produced and aired.

4,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Netherlands is part of the United Kingdom based on the given context. Let me read the context again carefully.  The context says that both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are countries run under a constitutional monarchy. It also mentions that King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands is around 890th in line to the British throne.   Hmm so both countries have constitutional monarchies which means they each have their own monarchs but governed by constitutions. The fact that the Dutch king is in line for the British throne suggests a historical or dynastic connection between the two royal families perhaps through intermarriage or succession agreements.  But does this mean the Netherlands is part of the UK? I know from general knowledge that the United Kingdom consists of England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland. The Netherlands on the other hand is a separate country located in Western Europe known for cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam. They are neighboring countries but not part of the same sovereign state.  The context doesn't explicitly say anything about the Netherlands being part of the UK. It only talks about both being constitutional monarchies and the lineage of their kings. So even though there's a dynastic link in terms of succession lines it doesn't imply that one country is part of the other.  Therefore based on this analysis the answer should be False because the Netherlands is an independent country separate from the United Kingdom. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,40.25870009997743,0.013876760141517216,0.004074502502337804,0.06705740001052618,1.7909094606342655e-05,5.25847892764466e-06
10,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""She's Like the Wind"" is from the movie Dirty Dancing. Let me start by recalling what I know about this song and the movie.  I remember that ""She's Like the Wind"" is a power ballad which was released in 1987. It's associated with the film Dirty Dancing because Patrick Swayze starred in it and he also performed the song. The song was actually part of the movie's soundtrack so it makes sense that it would be included in the film.  Wait but I'm a bit confused about whether the song is featured in the actual movie or just part of the soundtrack. Sometimes songs are released after movies come out but in this case since Patrick Swayze was both an actor and the performer it's likely that the song was part of the movie's scenes.  Also I think the song became pretty popular reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. That kind of success usually means it was well-integrated into the film to make it memorable.  So putting this together yes ""She's Like the Wind"" is definitely from Dirty Dancing because Patrick Swayze was in the movie and performed the song which was part of its soundtrack. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,42.444140100007644,0.014645396275882168,0.004300189897732594,0.03134800001862459,8.06475722606087e-06,2.367978776257724e-06

It also provides details about when it was released and how many episodes it has. Additionally it talks about the main characters and some supporting ones which further confirms that this is part of the show's continuity.

16,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the Central Bank of India is a nationalized bank based on the given context. Let me read the context again carefully.  The context says that in 1963 the revolutionary government in Burma nationalized the operations of the Central Bank of India there which then became People's Bank No. 1. Nationalizing means taking over private ownership and making it state-owned. So in Burma the Central Bank of India's operations were taken over by the government.  Wait but does this mean that the Central Bank of India itself was nationalized? Or just its operations in Burma? The context specifically mentions their operations in Burma being nationalized. That doesn't necessarily imply that the entire Central Bank of India was nationalized across all regions or countries where it operates.  I should consider what ""nationalized"" means here. If a bank's operations in a specific country are nationalized it might mean that branch or subsidiary is taken over by the local government. The parent bank the Central Bank of India would still be based in India and under its own regulations unless there was a broader nationalization.  In India I know that several banks were nationalized in the past by the Indian government. For example major public sector banks like SBI and Punjab & Sind Bank were nationalized during the 1950s and 1960s. But the Central Bank of India is a private bank right? It's not one of the public sector banks under direct government control.  So in this context it's about Burma nationalizing the Central Bank of India's operations there. That doesn't mean the entire Central Bank of India was nationalized by its home country India. Therefore the answer should be False because the Central Bank of India itself isn't a nationalized bank; only its branch in Burma was taken over. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,47.25130859998171,0.016328264468922483,0.0047943146497438915,0.043774599995231256,1.151298729011998e-05,3.380450122693287e-06

The context says that Salt Lake City is the capital and the most populous municipality of Utah. It mentions an estimated population of 190 884 in 2014. Then it talks about the metropolitan area having a population of over a million (1 153 340) and part of a larger combined statistical area with around 2.4 million people.  Wait but the question is specifically asking if Salt Lake City itself is the biggest city in Utah. The context directly states that it's the most populous municipality. So even though the metropolitan areas are bigger the city proper has more residents than any other city in Utah. Therefore yes Salt Lake City is indeed the biggest city in Utah. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,48.77160539999022,0.016856434887464185,0.004949396359744082,0.017290899995714426,4.259314447214517e-06,1.2506224216916992e-06
20,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if ""melaleuca"" and ""tea tree"" are the same thing based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that tea tree oil is also known as melaleuca oil or ti tree oil. It mentions that it's an essential oil with a fresh camphoraceous odor and ranges in color from pale yellow to nearly colorless and clear. The oil comes from the leaves of the tea tree specifically Melaleuca alternifolia which is native to certain regions in Australia.  So breaking this down: Tea tree oil has alternative names—melaleuca oil and ti tree oil. That means melaleuca is another name for the same thing as tea tree oil. The scientific name given is Melaleuca alternifolia which refers to the plant from which the oil is extracted.  Therefore when the question asks if melaleuca and tea tree are the same thing it's referring to whether they're synonyms in this context. Since the context explicitly states that melaleuca oil is another name for tea tree oil they must be the same. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,40.47553850003169,0.01413859885349914,0.004151383739478119,0.01796299999114126,4.43471888688186e-06,1.3021247767844788e-06
21,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there will be new episodes of Black Mirror based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The show premiered in two series on Channel 4 in December 2011 and February 2013. Then Netflix added it to their catalogue in December 2014 and purchased the programme in September 2015. After that Netflix commissioned a series of 12 episodes which were split into the third and fourth series each with six episodes. The third series was released on October 21 2016 and the fourth on December 29 2017. Additionally a fifth series was announced on March 5 2018.  So up to the point of the context there have been five series: two on Channel 4 then three more on Netflix. The fifth series was announced in 2018. Now the question is whether there will be new episodes. Since the fifth series has already been announced that means those episodes were created and released after the announcement.  Wait but does the context mention if the fifth series has actually been released or not? It only says it was announced on March 5 2018. So based solely on this information we know that a fifth series is planned which would consist of new episodes. Therefore yes there will be new episodes because the fifth series is in development.  I think the answer should be 'True' because the context confirms that a fifth series was announced indicating more episodes are coming. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,43.45505089999642,0.015181376959517743,0.004457564862378995,0.034285000001545995,8.931260641353904e-06,2.622402020436513e-06
22,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if you can get a rash from using a hot tub based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that hot tub folliculitis is caused by an infection of hair follicles due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This bacterium is commonly found in places like hot tubs and water slides. It mentions that children are more prone because they stay in the water longer which makes sense as kids might play there for extended periods.  The symptoms described include a rash that looks similar to chickenpox at first but then develops into pimples. The rash can be painful or itchy. If left untreated and not scratched it goes away quickly within 7-10 days. However if the rash is aggravated it can persist for months becoming harder to treat.  Additionally after the dots (probably referring to the initial rash) go away there's a hyperpigmented lesion that takes a few months to fade completely.  So putting this together: The condition definitely causes a rash specifically hot tub folliculitis. It starts as a rash resembling chickenpox and then becomes pimples. Therefore yes using a hot tub can lead to getting such a rash. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,42.64735660000588,0.01489985278681618,0.0043749035686445,0.022208100010175258,5.582177224439672e-06,1.6390421710485628e-06
23,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if it's possible for twins to have two different fathers. The context provided talks about superfecundation which is when a woman gets pregnant from more than one act of intercourse in the same cycle. There are two types mentioned: heteropaternal and homopaternal.  Heteropaternal means that each egg was fertilized by sperm from different fathers. So if a woman has sex with two different men within the same ovulation period it's possible for her to conceive twins where each twin has a different biological father. This is called heteropaternal superfecundation.  The context also mentions that this leads to twins who are half-siblings genetically because they share the same mother but have different fathers. It's rare but can happen either through separate sexual acts or artificial insemination.  So putting it all together yes it's possible for twins to have two different fathers due to heteropaternal superfecundation. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,41.74508739999146,0.014600432977602537,0.00428698774755594,0.028825699992012233,7.503174573620994e-06,2.2030865464216037e-06
24,<think> Okay I need to determine if liquid nitrogen is the same as dry ice based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that liquid nitrogen is occasionally used to freeze and remove warts but mentions that it performs better than dry ice because it's colder requiring less time and pressure. It also notes that dry ice has fewer storage problems since it can be generated from compressed carbon dioxide gas as needed.  So from this I understand that both are substances used for freezing but they're not the same. Liquid nitrogen is a liquid form of nitrogen while dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. They have different properties and uses even though they might serve similar purposes in some applications like freezing warts.  Therefore the answer should be False because they are not the same substance. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,41.30953120000777,0.0144442020952511,0.004241115143677829,0.022651799983577803,5.659942777128889e-06,1.6618757385237194e-06
25,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Thousand Island dressing is the same as French dressing. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two dressings.  Thousand Island dressing is a creamy salad dressing that's often used on salads and sandwiches. It gets its name from the idea that there are ""thousands"" of islands in the region where it originated but I'm not exactly sure which specific islands or regions those are. I think it might be near Canada or somewhere in the northeastern United States.  French dressing on the other hand is a vinaigrette-based dressing made with olive oil vinegar (like red wine vinegar) and herbs such as parsley garlic or tarragon. It's tangy and typically not creamy. I know it's commonly used in France and other parts of Europe.  Now looking at the context provided: Michael Bell and his students looked into the origin of Thousand Island dressing in 2010. They found that different villages and islands had varying origin stories. One of these stories suggested that the original recipe was based on French dressing supported by a recipe from the 1965 edition of The Fannie Farmer Cookbook.  So according to this context there's an origin story where Thousand Island dressing is linked to French dressing. However it also mentions that all claims were based on oral traditions without written records. That means while there's a connection in terms of inspiration or influence the actual dressings might have evolved differently over time.  Thousand Island is creamy and typically contains mayonnaise whereas French dressing is more oily and acidic. They serve different purposes and are used in various dishes. So even if Thousand Island was inspired by French dressing they aren't exactly the same product.  Therefore considering their ingredients textures and uses I would say that Thousand Island dressing is not the same as French dressing. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,43.85084550001193,0.015323969716717017,0.004499433031901177,0.023951899987878278,6.11462893558965e-06,1.7953809567110661e-06
26,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Fred from First Dates has a partner based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context mentions that Sirieix lives in Peckham south London. In an interview with the Daily Mail in 2016 he was living with his former partner and their two children but was in a new relationship. Then in 2018 he announced he was in a relationship referring to his partner as his 'fruitcake'.  Wait the question is about Fred from First Dates. The context talks about Sirieix not Fred. I'm trying to see if these are the same person. Maybe it's a nickname or a different name? But without more information linking Sirieix to Fred from First Dates I can't assume they're the same.  So based on the provided context alone there's no mention of Fred having a partner. The context discusses Sirieix's relationships but doesn't connect him to Fred from First Dates. Therefore I don't have enough information to confirm if Fred has a partner. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,42.60354080001707,0.014899543376155658,0.004374812719303754,0.021885499998461455,5.468023337501412e-06,1.6055242393960615e-06
27,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether breakfast lunch and dinner are always served in Italy based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that Italian meals are typical of the Mediterranean region and different from Northern Europe Germany and Slavic areas. It mentions that they still often consist of breakfast lunch and supper. However it notes that breakfast is much less emphasized; sometimes skipped or has lighter portions compared to other Western countries. There's also mention of merenda which are late-morning and mid-afternoon snacks. Additionally celebratory meals are divided into several courses.  So the question is whether all three meals—breakfast lunch dinner—are always served in Italy. The context says they ""often"" consist of these three but points out that breakfast might be skipped or is lighter. That suggests it's not a strict rule; sometimes breakfast isn't served. Therefore it's not always the case that all three are served every day.  I think the answer should be False because while they do have the structure breakfast isn't always included. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,42.28952150000259,0.014786825910973269,0.004341716550654938,0.03259819999220781,8.407467215955773e-06,2.468605485746289e-06
28,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Scar is alive in The Lion King 2 based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that Scar makes a brief cameo appearance in Simba's nightmare. In this nightmare Simba runs down the cliff where his father died trying to rescue him. Then Scar intervenes and turns into Kovu throwing Simba off the cliff. Additionally Scar appears again as a reflection in a pool of water after Kovu is exiled from Pride Rock.  Hmm so in The Lion King 2 which I think is called ""The Lion King II: Simba's Pride "" Scar isn't actually present in live-action scenes but appears in Simba's nightmare and as a reflection. Now the question is whether Scar is alive in this movie.  I know that in the first Lion King movie Scar dies when Mufasa pushes him off a cliff during their battle. So he's dead by the end of the first film. In The Lion King 2 Scar doesn't have any speaking parts or physical presence; instead he appears as part of Simba's nightmare and as a reflection.  So in reality Scar is deceased but his spirit or memory haunts Simba in these scenes. Therefore even though Scar appears in the movie it's not as a living character but rather as a figment of Simba's imagination or a manifestation of his guilt.  Therefore based on this analysis Scar isn't alive in The Lion King 2; he's dead and only appears through these symbolic cameos. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,45.82436549998238,0.016027706330761084,0.004706064591837888,0.0439827999798581,1.1578821185528948e-05,3.399780309916164e-06
29,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether alligators drown their prey and then eat it later based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that alligators have a heavy body and slow metabolism but can move quickly in short bursts. Their main prey are smaller animals they can kill with one bite. It also mentions that for larger prey they grab them and drag them into water to drown. Then it talks about how they handle food that's too big to eat in one bite—either letting it rot or using a ""death roll"" by spinning or convulsing to tear off chunks.  Importantly the context explains that the death roll requires the tail to flex significantly; without movement of the tail they can't perform this action. So for larger prey alligators drown them and then proceed to eat by tearing pieces possibly over time.  The question is whether alligators both drown their prey and eat it later. From the context yes they do drown larger prey and then consume it which might take some time as they tear off chunks or let it rot if necessary. So the answer should be True. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,42.0283352000115,0.014698526006096552,0.004315789880473476,0.033040600013919175,8.616974521818182e-06,2.5301211445375997e-06
30,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if cowpeas and black-eyed peas are the same thing based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that cultivated cowpeas have several common names including black-eyed pea southern pea yardlong bean catjang and crowder pea. So right there it lists black-eyed pea as one of the alternative names for cowpeas. That suggests they are the same thing because different names can refer to the same plant or product.  Additionally it mentions that cowpeas were domesticated in Africa and have been farmed for a long time. It also talks about their spread into other regions like Asia Europe and the Americas. The context further explains how the seeds are used in cooking such as making stews curries or grinding them into flour.  Since black-eyed pea is listed alongside cowpeas under common names it's clear that they're referring to the same plant. There's no indication of any difference between them; instead it's emphasizing that these are various ways people refer to the same crop. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,46.10240349997184,0.01612237153352242,0.004733860244540812,0.02081810001982376,5.178144446916929e-06,1.5204098284661165e-06
31,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Isle of Man is part of the European Economic Area (EEA) based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that the Isle of Man doesn't have membership or associate membership in the European Union and lies outside the EEA. That seems pretty straightforward. It also mentions Protocol 3 which allows trade in Manx goods without non-EU tariffs. Additionally there's a Customs and Excise agreement with the UK that facilitates free trade between them.  Wait but it says that while Manx goods can be freely moved within the EEA people capital and services cannot. Hmm so if goods can move freely into the EEA from the Isle of Man does that mean the Isle is part of the EEA? Or is there a different interpretation?  I think I need to clarify what it means for goods to be traded without tariffs but not being part of the EEA. The EEA includes countries that have agreed to implement the EU's internal market rules even if they're not EU members. So non-EU countries in the EEA are part of the single market.  But the context explicitly states that the Isle is outside the EEA. Even though goods can be traded into the EEA without tariffs it doesn't necessarily mean the Isle itself is part of the EEA. It might just have a special trade agreement with the EU or the UK allowing this.  So putting it all together: The Isle isn't in the EEA because the context says so directly. Protocol 3 and the Customs agreement facilitate trade but don't make it part of the EEA. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,45.289491200004704,0.015833193167774935,0.004648951522126932,0.037445099995238706,9.719707219402254e-06,2.853906169997063e-06

The context says that after a 5-15 start the Heat improved and finished with a record of 42-40 which qualified them for the NBA playoffs. That means they did make it to the playoffs because teams with a .500 or better record usually qualify depending on conference standings.  Additionally it mentions that Wade had an outstanding performance in the playoffs especially against the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals. It also talks about him hitting a game-winning shot and advancing to the second round before losing to the Pacers.  So putting this together yes Dwyane Wade did make the playoffs during his rookie year because the Miami Heat qualified for them by finishing with a winning record. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,43.079536600009305,0.015062933258723184,0.004422787353050308,0.04118590001598932,1.0766848388128656e-05,3.1613683779451332e-06
33,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether King Louie died in The Jungle Book (2016). Let me start by recalling what I know about the movie. The Jungle Book is an animated film released in 2016 by Disney. It's based on Rudyard Kipling's book and follows Mowgli a human boy raised by wolves in the jungle.  In the story King Louie is a character who is a giant ape and the ruler of the jungle. He plays a significant role in the movie especially in the song ""I Wan'na Be Like You "" which is about him wanting to be like humans. I remember that in some versions of The Jungle Book King Louie doesn't survive but I'm not sure if that's the case in the 2016 version.  Looking at the context provided: during the credits Louie is shown emerging from the rubble and performing ""I Wan'na Be like You"" with slightly modified lyrics. This suggests that he survives the events of the movie because he's present during the credits. If he had died it's unlikely they would feature him in the closing scenes.  Also considering the nature of Disney movies especially recent ones characters often survive unless there's a clear indication otherwise. The fact that Louie is performing at the end implies he's alive and well after the main story concludes.  Therefore based on the context given and my general knowledge of the 2016 movie King Louie does not die in The Jungle Book (2016). </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,45.4884400999872,0.015907209932150727,0.004670684368165094,0.03872340000816621,1.0070757780825565e-05,2.9569818430201167e-06
34,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if England has ever won the Women's World Cup based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that England has qualified for the FIFA Women's World Cup four times. They reached the quarter final stage in their first three attempts which were in 1995 2007 and 2011. Then it mentions they finished third in 2015. Additionally they made it to the finals of the UEFA Women's Championship in 1984 and 2009.  Now the question is asking if England has ever won the Women's World Cup. From the context I see that they've qualified four times but only reached the quarter finals three times and finished third once. There's no mention of them winning any of those tournaments. They did reach the final in 1984 and 2009 for the UEFA Championship which is a different competition from the FIFA World Cup.  So putting it together England hasn't won the FIFA Women's World Cup based on the information provided. They've been runners-up or made it to the finals in other tournaments but not in the World Cup itself. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,42.71815420000348,0.0149304723450635,0.004383894101407686,0.028050900000380352,5.541942776310153e-06,1.6272285086437892e-06
35,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the dorsal root ganglion carries sensory input based on the given context. Let me read the context again carefully.  The context says that a dorsal root ganglion is a cluster of neurons in the dorsal root of a spinal nerve. It also mentions that these ganglia contain the cell bodies of sensory neurons known as first-order neurons.   Hmm so sensory neurons are involved in detecting stimuli and sending signals to the central nervous system. The first-order neurons would be the initial part of this pathway. Since the ganglion houses their cell bodies it's where these neurons originate from.  Now does the ganglion itself carry the sensory input? Well the ganglion isn't a nerve fiber; it's more like a hub where the neurons are located. The actual transmission happens through the axons of these neurons. So the ganglion supports the neurons but doesn't carry the signals itself.   Wait but sometimes people refer to nerves carrying information so maybe I'm conflating the ganglion with the nerve fibers. The ganglion is a structure where the cell bodies are not the part that conducts impulses. Therefore it's the sensory neurons (their axons) that carry the input not the ganglion itself.  So putting this together does the dorsal root ganglion carry sensory input? I think no because the ganglion is more about housing the neurons rather than transmitting the signals. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,45.613288299995475,0.015947580900393728,0.004682538115686158,0.038965400017332286,1.0152996142031748e-05,2.981128719171722e-06
36,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the Mafia is still active in New Jersey based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The DeCavalcante crime family is mentioned as an Italian-American organized crime group operating in Elizabeth New Jersey and surrounding areas. They're part of the American Mafia or Cosa Nostra. The context also talks about their various illicit activities like drug trafficking fraud money laundering etc. which suggests they are involved in criminal activities.  Additionally it's noted that the DeCavalcante family has strong relations with other crime families such as the Five Families of New York Philadelphia and Patriarca. These connections imply ongoing interactions and possibly continued operations.  The context also mentions media coverage about them like the TV documentaries which were aired in 2006 and 2010. While this doesn't directly state their current status it shows that they were active enough to be featured then.  However the information provided stops at 2010. There's no explicit mention of whether their activities have continued beyond that. But given that organized crime families often adapt and continue operations unless there's specific information indicating a shutdown I can infer that they are still active.  So putting it all together yes the Mafia is still active in New Jersey as represented by the DeCavalcante family. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,43.10406850001891,0.015069102831302578,0.004424598866592138,0.01607270000386052,3.910035559157323e-06,1.1480669484479858e-06
37,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if finding a four-leaf clover is considered lucky based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context starts by saying that the four-leaf clover is a rare variation of the common three-leaf clover and mentions traditional superstition associating it with good luck. However it's unclear when or how this superstition began.   Looking further there are mentions from different time periods. The earliest mention in 1640 refers to it being kept in gardens because it was ""good for the purples in children or others."" That doesn't directly talk about luck but rather its medicinal use.  Then an 1869 description says that four-leaf clovers were gathered at night during a full moon by sorceresses and mixed with other ingredients. Young girls sought it as a token of perfect happiness. This seems to tie the clover into some magical or lucky properties possibly for happiness which is related to luck.  The key point comes from an 1877 letter in St. Nicholas Magazine where an 11-year-old girl wrote asking if fairies whispered that a four-leaf clover brings good luck to the finder. This directly connects finding it with bringing good luck.  So putting this together while earlier mentions were more about its use for health or happiness by 1877 there's a clear reference linking the four-leaf clover to good luck upon finding it. Therefore based on the context provided yes it is considered lucky. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,46.547191399964504,0.0162789668341127,0.004779839849117279,0.02984239999204874,7.693288380443005e-06,2.258907874579298e-06

Specifically it references Julia Gillard the former Prime Minister who offered a national apology in 2013 to those affected by these practices.  So the show is clearly inspired by actual events where children were forcibly adopted.

The context says that it's illegal to sell packaged liquor (off-premises sales) on Sundays. It also mentions that sales are prohibited on several holidays: Memorial Day Independence Day Labor Day Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Additionally low-point beer for off-premises consumption can't be sold between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.  The question is specifically about whether liquor stores in Oklahoma are open on the 4th of July. From the context I see that Independence Day is listed as one of the holidays where sales are prohibited. Since selling packaged liquor off-premises isn't allowed on these days it would mean that liquor stores can't sell alcohol on those dates.  Therefore since the 4th of July is an Independence Day which falls under the prohibited sales days liquor stores in Oklahoma should be closed on that day. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,43.573705900023924,0.015226422224013542,0.004470791079524415,0.013869900023564696,3.316101668719461e-06,9.736757290183106e-07

The context says that thread seal tape is also known as PTFE tape or plumber's tape. It mentions that it's a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film tape used in plumbing for sealing pipe threads. So right off the bat I see that thread seal tape and PTFE tape are synonyms.  Then it refers to Teflon tape as another name for it but with a note that while Teflon is identical to PTFE Chemours (the trademark holders) consider this usage incorrect because they don't manufacture Teflon in tape form anymore. So the context clarifies that Teflon is a brand name owned by Chemours and using ""Teflon"" as a generic term for the tape might be incorrect according to them.  However despite the trademark issues the context still refers to thread seal tape as Teflon tape indicating that in common usage people do use both terms interchangeably. The key point is that they are made of PTFE which is the same material as Teflon.  So putting it together: thread seal tape is another name for PTFE tape and Teflon tape is a genericized trademark for the same product. Therefore in practical terms they refer to the same thing even though there's a trademark consideration about using ""Teflon"" as a generic term.  I think that means the answer should be True because despite the trademark nuances they are functionally and commonly considered the same. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,46.6147697000124,0.01631014298984032,0.004788993810361115,0.022479999985080212,5.609437775274273e-06,1.6470464300728558e-06
41,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether you have to be Mormon to attend BYU based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that BYU has students from every state in the U.S. and many foreign countries. In 2005-06 there were 2 396 foreign students which made up 8% of enrollment. Then it mentions that slightly more than 98% of these students are active members of the LDS Church. Also in 2006 about 12.6% of the student body reported themselves as ethnic minorities mostly Asians Pacific Islanders and Hispanics.  So from this I understand that most students at BYU are Mormons because over 98% are active LDS members. However it's not 100% so there must be some non-Mormon students attending. The presence of foreign students and ethnic minorities also suggests diversity in religious backgrounds.  Therefore the answer should be False because while a large majority are Mormon it's not a requirement to attend BYU. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,44.60095550000551,0.01559445188219944,0.004578852164959377,0.009177599975373596,2.045827772558874e-06,6.006971579557705e-07
42,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Dr. Burke comes back after Season 3 of the show. The context provided says that while mentioned in passing throughout later seasons Burke officially returns in the tenth season to conclude Cristina Yang's departure from the series.  First let me break down what this means. The context mentions two key points: first that Burke is mentioned in later seasons but not necessarily returning yet; and second his official return happens in Season 10 specifically because of Cristina leaving.  So the question is asking if he comes back after Season 3. Well Season 3 is much earlier than Season 10. The context clearly states that his return is in Season 10 which is way after Season 3. Therefore even though he's mentioned later on his actual return happens much further down the line.  I should also consider if there are any hints or mentions of him before Season 10. The context says he's mentioned in passing throughout later seasons but that doesn't mean he comes back until Season 10. So between Season 3 and Season 10 he might be talked about but not actually present as a character.  Therefore the answer should be False because Dr. Burke doesn't come back after Season 3; he returns much later in Season 10. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,43.835780099994736,0.015334163099955224,0.0045024260191033625,0.05468640002072789,1.4513926232128998e-05,4.2615875858967e-06
43,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if a dog can be mixed with three breeds based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context talks about crossbred ""designer dogs."" It mentions that these are typically named using portmanteau words from the two purebred parents' names like Schnoodle (Schnauzer and Poodle) or Shepsky (German Shepherd and Siberian Husky). It also gives examples of other breeds being crossed to create various labels such as the Puggle (Pug and Beagle).  Then there's a specific mention: ""There are even complex crosses (with multiple breeds in recent ancestry) being labeled in this manner such as German Chusky (German Shepherd Dog Husky Chow Chow)."" So here the German Chusky is a mix of three breeds—German Shepherd Husky and Chow Chow.  This directly answers the question. Since the context provides an example where a dog is mixed with three breeds it's clear that yes such crosses do occur. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,44.830942700005835,0.015683257831300073,0.0046049274201445155,0.037239600002067164,9.681462218577507e-06,2.84267665028402e-06
44,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the right atrium receives blood from the lungs. Let me start by recalling what I know about the human heart structure and function.  From the context provided the heart has four chambers: two atria (right and left) and two ventricles (right and left). The atria are the upper chambers. The right atrium gets deoxygenated blood from various veins including the superior vena cava inferior vena cava anterior cardiac veins smallest cardiac veins and the coronary sinus. This blood then goes down to the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve.  The left atrium on the other hand receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins. The context mentions that the left atrium gets blood from the left and right pulmonary veins which makes sense because after the blood is oxygenated in the lungs it returns to the heart via these veins.  So the question is about whether the right atrium receives blood from the lungs. From what I understand the right atrium doesn't get blood directly from the lungs. Instead it's the left atrium that gets the oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins. The right atrium deals with deoxygenated blood coming from the body via the venae cavae and other veins.  Therefore based on this information the right atrium does not receive blood directly from the lungs. It receives blood from the systemic circulation through the venae cavae while the left atrium is where the pulmonary circulation's oxygenated blood enters. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,44.592650400009006,0.015592592598908148,0.0045783062411021026,0.024567500018747523,6.1678416672900005e-06,1.8110053103972433e-06
45,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether a certification of birth is the same as a birth certificate based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that the actual record of birth is stored with a government agency. This agency issues certified copies or representations of the original birth record upon request. These can be used for things like applying for passports which are government benefits. The certification is signed and/or sealed by the registrar or another custodian of birth records who is commissioned by the government.  Hmm so the actual birth certificate is stored somewhere but when someone asks for a certified copy that's what they get. So the original is kept with the agency and the certified copy is given to the person. The certification has official markings like signatures or seals from authorized personnel.  So is the certification of birth the same as the birth certificate? Well the birth certificate would be the original document stored by the government. The certification seems to be a copy that's been authenticated. So they're similar but not exactly the same. The certification is an official copy but it's not the original record itself.  Therefore I think the answer should be False because while they serve similar purposes and are both official documents one is the original (birth certificate) and the other is a certified copy (certification of birth). </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,45.081392899970524,0.015766734546252704,0.004629437902453986,0.01815719998558052,4.5012755913956055e-06,1.3216671956432778e-06
46,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if ""dry water"" actually exists based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that dry water is an unusual form of ""powdered liquid."" It's described as a water-air emulsion where tiny water droplets each about the size of a grain of sand are coated with sandy silica. This coating prevents the water droplets from combining into bulk liquid resulting in a white powder similar to table salt. It's also referred to as ""empty water.""  So dry water isn't just theoretical; it's an actual substance created by scientists. The description provides specific details about its composition and properties which suggests that it's a real thing.  Therefore the answer should be True because the context clearly explains that dry water exists. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,44.021329600014724,0.015398663145510725,0.004521364560545072,0.0329001999925822,8.434087221394291e-06,2.4764216674533562e-06
47,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether every country has its own sign language based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says there are perhaps three hundred sign languages in use around the world today. It mentions that new ones emerge frequently due to creolization de novo creation and sometimes through language planning. So it's clear that sign languages can develop independently or through specific processes.  It then gives examples of countries like Sri Lanka and Tanzania where each school for the deaf might have a separate sign language known only to its students. Sometimes these are even denied by the schools. On the other hand some countries share sign languages under different names such as Croatian and Serbian or Indian and Pakistani. This suggests that not every country has a unique sign language; sometimes they share them.  Additionally it mentions that deaf sign languages can arise outside educational institutions especially in villages with high congenital deafness. However there are also significant sign languages developed for hearing individuals like the speech-taboo languages used in aboriginal Australia. This indicates diversity but doesn't necessarily mean each country has its own.  Scholars are working to identify all the world's sign languages through field surveys which implies that many might not be widely known or standardized yet.  Putting this together: The context shows variation—some countries have unique sign languages within schools others share them across borders. There's no indication that every single country has a distinct one. For example some countries share the same sign language under different names and in other cases like Australia there are languages for hearing people. Therefore it's not true that every country has its own sign language. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,46.61481840000488,0.016315944999162883,0.004790697399762552,0.02203569997800514,5.50867277181371e-06,1.6174597502887335e-06
48,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether all states in the United States enforce a minimum drinking age of 21 based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context starts by mentioning an act that didn't outlaw the consumption of alcoholic beverages by those under 21 but only prohibited their purchase. So the law is about purchasing not necessarily consuming. Then it says that some states like Alabama Indiana Kansas Michigan North Carolina Pennsylvania Vermont and the District of Columbia extended this into an outright ban. That means in these places underage drinking (under 21) is banned.  However it also mentions that the minimum purchase and drinking age is a state law so each state can have its own rules. Most states still permit ""underage"" consumption in some circumstances. Some states don't restrict private consumption at all while others allow it only in specific situations like with family supervision during religious occasions or events.  The act doesn't criminalize alcohol consumption during religious events such as communion wine or Kiddush. So even if someone under 21 drinks for religious reasons it's not illegal under this law.  Putting this together: The federal law (the act) deals with the purchase age but leaves drinking laws to states. Some states have a 21 minimum drinking age others allow underage drinking in certain situations. Therefore not all states enforce a 21 minimum drinking age. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,45.275602200010326,0.015845811998781528,0.0046526566707342865,0.031034599989652634,8.049503961397045e-06,2.363500103685181e-06
49,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there are tolls on I-70 in Kansas based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that in Topeka I-70 intersects a child route I-470 twice. The second time they intersect the Kansas Turnpike merges making I-70 into a toll road. It mentions that this is one of only two sections of I-70 that are tolled with the other being along the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The maximum toll distance costs $17.50 as of 2016.  So from Topeka to Bonner Springs I-70 carries this designation which is where the Kansas Turnpike ends. From there to 18th Street and extending to the Kansas eastern border the highway is free.  Putting this together it seems that part of I-70 in Kansas does have tolls because when I-70 merges with the Kansas Turnpike it becomes a toll road. The context explicitly states that this section is one of two tolled parts of I-70 so yes there are tolls on I-70 in Kansas. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,45.36462909998954,0.015873132749010317,0.004660678605540229,0.00967650001985021,2.143449444297908e-06,6.293608908247315e-07
50,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Trinity Forest Golf Club is a public course. Let me start by reading the context provided. It says that Trinity Forest is an 18-hole private golf club located in Dallas Texas. The key word here is ""private."" Private golf clubs typically require membership and don't allow the general public to play without special arrangements or memberships.  I remember from previous knowledge that public courses are open to anyone who pays the fee while private ones are exclusive to members. Since the context explicitly mentions it's a private club that means it's not accessible to the public. Therefore Trinity Forest Golf Club is not a public course. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,41.68366230002721,0.014582840818524274,0.004281822327425094,0.030037300020921975,7.695280001240057e-06,2.2594926554531146e-06
51,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if ""The Mountain Between Us"" is based on a true story. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context says it's a 2017 American drama film directed by Hany Abu-Assad and written by Chris Weitz and J. Mills Goodloe. It's based on a 2011 novel of the same name by Charles Martin. The movie stars Idris Elba and Kate Winslet as characters who survive a plane crash have a dog with them and are stranded in High Uintas Wilderness under harsh conditions.  So the film is an adaptation of a novel. Now the question is whether it's a true story. To determine that I need to check if the events depicted actually happened or if they're fictional.  The context mentions it's based on a 2011 novel which suggests that the story is original and not based on real-life events. Novels are typically works of fiction unless specified as non-fiction or memoirs. Since there's no mention in the context that the novel was based on true events I can infer that ""The Mountain Between Us"" is a fictional story.  Additionally the film's plot involves a plane crash and survival in a wilderness which are common themes in dramas but not necessarily indicative of being true stories unless specific details align with real incidents. However without any information linking the novel or the movie to actual events it's safe to conclude that it's fictional.  Therefore the answer should be False because it's based on a novel making it a work of fiction rather than a true story. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,47.329636799986474,0.016571502627007455,0.004865734381271578,0.03825240000151098,9.968728939468323e-06,2.927024074406898e-06
52,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the away goal counts in the playoffs based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that before the 1999-2000 season away goals were used as a tie-breaker after extra time. But then this was abolished because of a club initiative started by David Sheepshanks who was the chairman of Ipswich Town at the time. His club had lost twice on away goals in 1997 and 1999. Since then away goals have not been part of the playoff system.  So the key points are: - Before 1999-2000 away goals were a tie-breaker. - After that season they stopped using away goals because of Ipswich Town's initiative. - Therefore since then away goals don't count in playoffs anymore.  The question is asking if the away goal counts in the playoffs now. Based on the context it says that since 1999-2000 away goals have played no part in the play-off system. So the answer should be False because they are not used anymore. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,42.7840224999818,0.01498019892055963,0.004398494847851771,0.02205950001371093,5.563029442823285e-06,1.6334199881099986e-06
53,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Guernsey money is legal tender in the UK. Let me start by understanding what ""legal tender"" means. From what I know legal tender refers to coins and banknotes that can be used to pay debts and settle obligations according to law.  The context provided says that Guernsey has been in a currency union with the UK since 1921. It also mentions that the Guernsey pound is not a separate currency but is a local issue of banknotes and coins denominated in pound sterling. This is similar to how Scotland England and Northern Ireland have their own banknotes but still use the pound.  Furthermore it states that Guernsey money can be exchanged at par with other sterling coinage and notes. So this implies that Guernsey's currency is fully interchangeable with standard UK pounds without any loss in value.  Given all this if Guernsey's money is part of the same currency union and can be exchanged at par it should be accepted as legal tender in the UK. Therefore I think the answer is True. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,45.450039099989226,0.015911010501459908,0.004671800293568622,0.020114600018132478,5.025488364196403e-06,1.4755868593653575e-06
54,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" is an autobiography. Let me start by recalling what I know about this book. From the context provided it says that it's a 1969 autobiography written by Maya Angelou. It describes her early years and is part of a seven-volume series. The story is about her overcoming racism and trauma through strength and love for literature.  The question is straightforward: Is this an autobiography? Well an autobiography is a book where the author writes about their own life experiences. Since the context explicitly states that it's Maya Angelou's autobiography that should be enough to confirm it. But let me think deeper just to make sure I'm not missing anything.  The context mentions it's part of a seven-volume series which suggests that this is one part of her longer autobiographical work. The book covers her early years starting when she was three and moving to Stamps Arkansas with her brother up until her becoming a mother at 16. These are significant life events that someone would include in an autobiography.  Maya Angelou is known for her autobiographies so this aligns with what I know about her work. The transformation from being a victim of racism to a self-possessed woman is something she likely experienced herself which further supports it being an autobiography.  I don't see any conflicting information here. The context clearly labels it as an autobiography and the details fit that description. So putting it all together yes ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" is indeed Maya Angelou's autobiography. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,43.88758760000928,0.015373722919814025,0.004514041596757146,0.018021800002316013,4.44504222137362e-06,1.3051559203504256e-06
55,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the transmission and engine are the same thing based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that transmissions are commonly used in motor vehicles. Their main job is to adapt the output of the internal combustion engine to the drive wheels. It mentions that engines need to operate at a high rotational speed which isn't suitable for starting stopping or slower travel. The transmission reduces this higher engine speed to a lower wheel speed while increasing torque.  Additionally transmissions are used in other places like pedal bicycles and fixed machines where different speeds and torques are needed.   So from this I understand that the engine is the internal combustion part that generates power at high RPMs and the transmission adjusts that power to be suitable for the wheels or other machinery. They work together but serve different functions.  Therefore the transmission isn't the same as the engine; they're separate components with distinct roles. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,44.11730220000027,0.015448869581516141,0.004536106203915091,0.019110699999146163,4.699400002627503e-06,1.379840602195386e-06

The first one was ""Raiders of the Lost Ark "" released in 1981. Then came ""Temple of Doom"" in 1984 which is the movie we're talking about here.  I remember that sometimes sequels are just continuation of the same timeline but prequels tell earlier stories in a character's life. In this case Temple of Doom takes place before Raiders because it shows events that happened when Indiana was younger.

The context says that since the late 2000s the Canadian dollar has been valued at levels comparable to before the swift rise in 2007. It also mentions that for much of the 2010s a dollar was usually around the mid-70 cent US range.   Wait so if it's mid-70 cents that means one Canadian dollar is worth about 0.70 USD? Because 70 cents is less than a dollar. So in terms of value each CAD is worth less than a USD because you need more CAD to make a USD.  So the question is asking if the Canadian dollar is worth more than the US dollar. Since one CAD is about 0.70 USD that means it's actually worth less.

Alright so it mentions that there are similar attractions in the Magic Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland but they were ""formerly"" existing. The word ""formerly"" suggests that these attractions no longer exist now.

The context mentions something called a ""golden match "" which is when an opponent doesn't lose a single point in the entire match. It says this has only happened three times in competitive tennis history and never in a best-of-5 set match. The first was Hazel Wightman in 1910 then Benjamin Tullou in 2016 and Joffrey de Schepper also in 2016. Both of these later matches involved the same opponent Tomas Fabian who didn't win a single game across five different matches over two seasons.  So a golden match is essentially when one player wins without losing any points. That sounds like a perfect match because the opponent didn't score any points. The context confirms that this has happened three times so yes there have been perfect tennis matches where an opponent didn't win any points.  I should make sure I'm not missing anything.

Good rains in winter 2018 helped increase dam levels to 43% by June making Day Zero unlikely for 2019.  As of July 16 2018 the dams were at 55.1%. The city said water restrictions would stay until dam levels reach 85%.  So even though the situation improved from being critical in early 2018 to reaching over 55% by mid-2018 they're still under water restrictions and haven't reached the target of 85%. So technically there's still a crisis because restrictions are ongoing. But maybe it's not as severe as before.  I think the answer is False because while the immediate danger of Day Zero has passed the city is still managing water resources carefully so the crisis isn't over yet. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,41.42589010001393,0.014516652063016684,0.004262387945970633,0.03157350001856685,8.269569547171525e-06,2.428115890855407e-06
61,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if chewing tobacco is banned in Major League Baseball based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context mentions that between 1920 and 1940 every team had a tobacco sponsor because many players used tobacco. However it says that according to MLB this practice is changing and declining. There's a reason given for increased chewing tobacco usage among players: they thought it improved concentration and performance and was less harmful than smoking cigarettes. But the context clarifies that there's no established link between chewing tobacco and better performance.  It also talks about how chewing tobacco has become stigmatized in baseball with players having to sneak off to use it because they don't want kids copying them. Many players have tried to quit but struggle due to addiction. Lenny Dykstra is mentioned as someone who started dipping at a young age and advises against copying his spit-tobacco habit.  Importantly the context states that MLB has taken actions to lower tobacco usage. This includes a complete ban on tobacco with fines for players and managers if caught. Additionally tobacco companies are no longer allowed to leave free products in clubhouses starting December 5 2016. The new Collective Bargaining Agreement prohibits new players from using tobacco though those already in MLB before that date (grandfathered) can continue.  So putting this together: While there's a ban on new players using tobacco and fines for current players who do it doesn't explicitly say that chewing tobacco is completely banned. It seems more like a restriction rather than an outright ban because existing players are still allowed to use it. Therefore the answer would be False because it's not entirely banned; only new players are prohibited. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,45.724026499985484,0.016018539944796104,0.004703373152181166,0.0350474999868311,9.050283885315163e-06,2.657349695571834e-06
62,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Guitar Center and Musician's Friend are the same company. Let me start by reading the context provided.  In 2000 Guitar Center bought Musician's Friend for $50 million. The reason they did this was because they wanted to become the world's largest seller of musical instruments. After the purchase Musician's Friend became a wholly owned subsidiary of Guitar Center. That means Musician's Friend wasn't just another brand; it was fully controlled by Guitar Center.  From 2000 until 2011 Musician's Friend had its headquarters in Medford Oregon. But then they started moving their operations to Guitar Center's facilities in Westlake Village California. So the headquarters were consolidated into Guitar Center's main offices.  Now the question is asking if Guitar Center and Musician's Friend are the same company. Well when one company buys another the acquired company usually becomes a subsidiary. That means it operates under the parent company but remains its own entity. Even though they're part of the same larger organization they can still function as separate entities with their own branding and operations.  So in this case Guitar Center owns Musician's Friend but they aren't exactly the same company. They are related through ownership but each has its own identity and possibly different areas of operation or branding. Therefore saying they're the same company might not be accurate because they maintain their distinctiveness under the parent company.  I think that makes sense. So the answer should be False because while Guitar Center owns Musician's Friend they aren't the exact same company but rather subsidiary and parent relationship. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,46.74229310001829,0.016393559920873102,0.004813486738880757,0.03246780001791194,8.471926752192063e-06,2.4875321328177845e-06
63,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Beckett ever finds out who killed her mom based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context talks about a détente that continues until season six's penultimate episode called ""Veritas."" In this episode Senator Bracken realizes that Beckett was bluffing and tries to frame her for murder. Specifically he frames her for the murder of his associate drug lord Vulcan Simmons.   Beckett had discovered earlier that Bracken was using Vulcan's drug money to prepare for a run for the presidency. So Bracken captures her and berates her about her mother's death implying that it shaped her into being a good cop. He then leaves his thugs to kill her but she escapes by killing them.  Mr. Smith returns after having staged his death in season five to avoid Bracken's attention. Smith reveals there might be a tape recording of Bracken admitting to murder. Beckett remembers Captain Montgomery advising her to look into her mother's appointment book and tape recordings for clues.  With Castle's help she deduces where the tape is. The tape reveals that when Bracken was an Assistant D.A. he was blackmailing Montgomery and his friends regarding their mobster extortion scheme and the killing of FBI agent Arman. Bracken admits to wrongfully convicting Pulgatti for the killing and states he will have Johanna Beckett Beckett's lawyer killed if she continues investigating. He also admits having other people killed.  Montgomery helps from beyond the grave by guiding her to close the case. Beckett arrests Bracken during a live interview in his Senate Office for conspiracy fraud and the murder of her mother.  So putting this together: The context explicitly states that Beckett finds out who killed her mom when she confronts Bracken with the tape recording. He admits to her face-to-face leading to her arrest of him for her mother's murder among other charges. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,45.009132800012594,0.015780900092457296,0.004633597198490596,0.019962399994255975,4.95674333894082e-06,1.4554019044788686e-06
64,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if any Civil War battles were fought in Florida based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that when the war broke out the Confederates took many state army camps but the Union kept control of the main seaports. It mentions that there wasn't much fighting in Florida except for one major conflict: the Battle of Olustee near Lake City in February 1864. That's a specific battle mentioned.  So from this it seems clear that at least one battle did occur in Florida during the Civil War—the Battle of Olustee. The context also talks about other events like slaves escaping and deserters but those aren't battles. The key point is the mention of the Battle of Olustee as the only major conflict.  Therefore since there was a battle fought in Florida the answer should be 'True'. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,44.54724059998989,0.015624183181479852,0.004587581886600479,0.023724200000287965,5.952947784680872e-06,1.7479080417625887e-06
65,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether someone can get the death penalty if they're a minor based on the provided context. Let me read the context again carefully.  The context says that capital punishment for juveniles existed in the United States until March 1 2005. Then the U.S. Supreme Court banned it in Roper v. Simmons. So before 2005 minors could be sentenced to death but after that date it was no longer allowed.  The question is asking if you can get the death penalty as a minor. Since the ban happened on March 1 2005 I think this means that after that date minors cannot receive the death penalty. However before that date they could. But the context doesn't specify whether the ban applies retroactively or only to future cases.  Wait but the question is general: ""can you get the death penalty as a minor."" Without additional context about when the person in question was a minor relative to the crime I have to assume it's asking if it's possible now. Since the Supreme Court banned it in 2005 minors can't be sentenced to death anymore.  So putting that together the answer should be False because as of March 1 2005 capital punishment for juveniles was no longer allowed. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,45.16508449995308,0.015828301943433352,0.004647515357949124,0.024143699993146583,6.079664443839445e-06,1.7851146620085331e-06
66,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if boiling point is a characteristic property of matter based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that a characteristic property is a chemical or physical property that helps identify and classify substances. It also mentions that these properties are consistent regardless of the sample size—whether it's large or small. Examples provided include freezing/melting point boiling/condensing point density viscosity and solubility.  Wait so in the examples listed boiling/condensing point is explicitly mentioned as one of them. That seems straightforward. The context defines characteristic properties as those that are inherent to a substance and don't change with sample size or other factors like purity assuming they're consistent under the same conditions.  So boiling point being part of the examples given in the context directly answers the question. Since it's listed there it must be a characteristic property. There's no ambiguity here because the example clearly includes boiling/condensing points as such properties. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,44.95004950001021,0.015760814339105454,0.004627699607737508,0.026560400001471862,6.723873330823456e-06,1.9742676555946586e-06
67,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Trinidad and Tobago were in the World Cup in 2018 based on the given context. The context says that they failed to qualify between 1966 and 2002 then again from 2010 to 2018. Wait so let me break this down.  First the time periods mentioned are two separate intervals: 1966-2002 and 2010-2018. That means they didn't qualify during those times. So from 1966 up until 2002 they weren't in the World Cup. Then there's a gap between 2002 and 2010 where maybe they did qualify? But the context doesn't specify that; it just says they failed again from 2010 to 2018.  So focusing on 2018 specifically since the question is about whether they were in the World Cup that year. The context states they failed to qualify between 2010 and 2018. That includes 2018 right? So if they didn't qualify from 2010 onwards until 2018 then in 2018 they weren't part of the World Cup.  I should make sure I'm interpreting the time periods correctly. The first period is 1966 to 2002 which is a span of about 36 years where they didn't qualify. Then another period from 2010 to 2018 which is about 8 years. So between 2002 and 2010 there's an 8-year gap not mentioned. Maybe in that time they did qualify? But the context doesn't say anything about qualifying during those years; it only mentions failing before 2010 and after.  Therefore since 2018 falls within the period where they failed to qualify (2010-2018) Trinidad and Tobago were not in the World Cup in 2018. So the answer should be False. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,47.53493389999494,0.01666614824384052,0.004893524283142684,0.023041099979309365,5.795558331818837e-06,1.7016952577274078e-06
68,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether North and South Korea speak the same language. From what I know both countries use Korean but they've been separated for a long time. The context says that the Korean language has changed between the two states because of how long they've been apart. That makes me think that while they might still understand each other to some extent there are differences in their languages now.  I remember hearing that South Korea uses Hangul which is the alphabet created by King Sejong. North Korea also uses Hangul but I think they have different vocabulary and maybe grammar too because of the political separation. They probably don't keep up with each other's language changes since they're not interacting much.  So considering all this even though both use Korean the changes over time mean they aren't exactly the same anymore. Therefore the answer should be False. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,43.69118329999037,0.015322880914048738,0.004499113337019143,0.046335200022440404,1.2083765560883976e-05,3.548042375408673e-06
69,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if it's rare to have six wisdom teeth based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that most adults have four wisdom teeth one in each quadrant. It mentions that it's possible to have none fewer or more. When there are more than four they're called supernumerary teeth. So having six would mean two extra beyond the usual four.  Now the question is whether this is rare. The context doesn't specify how common or rare having more than four wisdom teeth is. It just states that it's possible. Since the context doesn't provide statistics or indicate rarity I can't assume it's rare. Therefore without additional information suggesting that six is uncommon I should consider that it's not necessarily rare. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,45.072868400020525,0.0158085997812121,0.004641730397450183,0.031475800002226606,8.059153333791377e-06,2.3663333581023315e-06

The context says that after defeating his greatest adversary the White Witch leaves with her army to prepare for war against the Narnians thinking she'll win. Then Lucy Susan and some mice remove Aslan's bonds but when the Stone Table breaks they find his body is gone. They're shocked because Aslan reappears alive and well.  The reason given is that a Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time brought him back. The White Witch who entered Narnia only at the Dawn of Time didn't know about this magic. Aslan explains that this Deeper Magic works when an innocent willingly offers his life in place of a traitor's reversing death until the victim is reborn.  So putting it together: Aslan was dead but came back to life because of this ancient magic. The context explicitly states he reappears alive and well after the Stone Table breaks which implies that yes he comes back to life in Narnia. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,45.39941080001881,0.015923864403612844,0.004675574463904697,0.025134700001217425,6.415172839638414e-06,1.8836268351885172e-06
71,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether cows have to keep getting pregnant to produce milk based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that to maintain lactation a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves. It mentions that depending on market conditions they can be bred with either a dairy bull or a beef bull. Female calves called heifers might become replacement cows if they have dairy breeding. If a heifer isn't good at producing milk she goes to market for beef.  It also talks about male calves being used as breeding bulls or sold for veal or beef. Farmers start breeding heifers around 13 months old and the cow's gestation is about nine months. Calves are removed from their mothers within three days to prevent stress.  So putting this together: cows need to be bred (pregnant) to keep producing milk because lactation requires them to have calves. Without being pregnant they might stop lactating. So yes cows must keep getting pregnant to produce milk. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,42.890549600007944,0.015047520113716385,0.004418261736317105,0.018406399991363287,4.6083161293528874e-06,1.3530965015699307e-06

The context says that the fourteenth season was ordered by ABC on February 10 2017. It also mentions that it premiered on September 28 2017 with a two-hour special premiere. Additionally it notes that the season has 24 episodes and that the seventh episode of this season is the 300th overall for the series.  From this information it's clear that Season 14 was indeed ordered and produced. The details about the premiere date and number of episodes further confirm its existence.

73,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if it's possible to have multiple foreign keys in a single table based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says ""A table may have multiple foreign keys and each foreign key can have a different parent table."" That clearly states that a table can indeed have more than one foreign key. Each of these foreign keys points to a different parent table which means they reference various other tables in the database.   Additionally it mentions that each foreign key is enforced independently by the database system. This independence implies that having multiple foreign keys doesn't interfere with each other; each operates on its own terms. Furthermore cascading relationships can be established using these foreign keys allowing for complex data relationships where actions on one table can trigger actions in related tables.  So putting it all together the context explicitly allows and explains how a table can have multiple foreign keys each referencing different parent tables with their own enforcement and cascading behaviors. Therefore the answer should be straightforward. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,42.63574910000898,0.01496096886381423,0.004392848507241269,0.0205337000079453,5.174956110648862e-06,1.5194736672894404e-06

The context says that Black Ops III takes place in 2065 and mentions climate change and new technologies. It follows black ops soldiers similar to previous games. The campaign supports 4-player co-op with bigger levels and less corridor shooting. Players have special activities because their characters are cybernetically enhanced.  Then it specifically mentions a ""standalone Zombies mode"" and a ""Nightmares"" mode where all enemies become zombies. So the game definitely has a zombies mode which is separate from the main campaign. The Nightmares mode also involves zombies replacing regular enemies so that's another way zombies appear in the game.  Therefore based on this context Call of Duty Black Ops 3 does have zombies. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,42.1863083000062,0.014795196677418663,0.004344174380038772,0.017400799988536164,4.3011272251735335e-06,1.2628995142324861e-06
75,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether you have to pay to watch ITV Hub based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context starts by mentioning that the service began as a website and then expanded to TV and other platforms. It talks about the initial use of Microsoft Silverlight instead of Adobe Flash which was used by BBC iPlayer and 4oD. Then it mentions that ITV switched to using Flash on September 15 2009.  Next in November 2009 the website was revamped to improve navigation and make it more visually appealing. The service is described as free to use funded by pre- mid- and post-roll adverts. It also notes that users could previously use ad-blocking software to skip these ads but that during Summer 2010 ITV upgraded its website to detect such software.  Additionally the context explains that video is sent at multiple bit rates with adaptive technology to adjust based on the user's connection speed.  So putting this together: The service (ITV Hub) is free to use. It makes money through ads which users can sometimes block but not anymore after 2010 when detection was implemented. There's no mention of any subscription or payment required to access the content.  Therefore based on the context provided you don't have to pay to watch ITV Hub. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,43.07657389997621,0.015107411081810459,0.004435846957714472,0.04038710001623258,1.0497818333290828e-05,3.082375614471385e-06

The context says that in 2011 Sylvester Stallone was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame for his work on the Rocky Balboa character. It mentions he entertained and inspired boxing fans worldwide. Also he received an award from the Boxing Writers Association of America for Lifetime Cinematic Achievement in Boxing.  Wait so it's Stallone who was inducted not Rocky Balboa himself. Rocky is a fictional character created by Stallone. The Hall of Fame usually honors real people or boxers not movie characters. So even though Stallone was recognized for portraying Rocky the induction was for him not the character.  Therefore Rocky Balboa isn't actually in the Boxing Hall of Fame; it's Sylvester Stallone who received that honor. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,42.75671889996738,0.015001847130152741,0.004404851207928527,0.01803549999021925,4.4585677780560225e-06,1.30912730228583e-06
77,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the internal intercostal muscles contract during inspiration based on the given context. Let me start by reading the context carefully.  The context says that the internal intercostal muscles have fibres angled obliquely downward and backward from rib to rib. These muscles can assist in lowering the rib cage adding force to exhalation.   Hmm so the key points here are: 1. The direction of the muscle fibers: they go downward and backward. 2. Their function is to lower the rib cage. 3. This action adds force to exhalation.  Now I know that during inspiration (inhaling) the diaphragm contracts and moves downward while the external intercostal muscles contract pulling the ribs upward and outward which increases the chest cavity volume and allows more air in.   In contrast during expiration (exhaling) the internal intercostal muscles come into play. Their fibers are oriented such that when they contract they pull the ribs downward helping to reduce the chest cavity size and push air out. This aligns with what the context states about their role in adding force to exhalation.  So if the internal intercostal muscles are involved in lowering the rib cage during exhalation it means they don't contract during inspiration. Instead it's the external intercostals that do the work during inhalation.  Therefore when asked whether the internal intercostal muscles contract during inspiration the answer should be False because their contraction is associated with expiration not inspiration. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,44.86082429997623,0.01573701912890083,0.0046207128440741135,0.018564999976661056,4.592652221617754e-06,1.3484972557364426e-06
78,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""log x"" is the same as ""ln x"". Let me start by recalling what each of these stands for.   I know that ""ln x"" stands for the natural logarithm of x. The natural logarithm uses the base e which is approximately 2.71828. It's called natural because it arises naturally in many mathematical contexts especially involving calculus and exponential growth or decay.  Now what about ""log x""? I remember that ""log"" can be a bit ambiguous because its base isn't always specified. In some contexts like mathematics especially higher-level math when someone writes ""log x"" without any base indicated they usually mean the natural logarithm which would be ln x. But in other fields or contexts like computer science or engineering ""log x"" might refer to log base 10 which is different.  Looking back at the context provided: it says that the natural logarithm of x is generally written as ln x log x or sometimes just log x if the base e is implicit. It also mentions that parentheses are added for clarity when the argument isn't a single symbol to prevent ambiguity. So according to this context ""log x"" can indeed mean the same as ""ln x"" because it's referring to the natural logarithm.  However I should consider that outside of this specific context ""log x"" might not always be the natural logarithm. But since the question is based on the provided context which explicitly states that ""log x"" can represent the natural logarithm especially when the base e is implicit I think the answer would be true.  Wait but sometimes in other contexts like high school math ""log x"" might default to base 10. So does the context override that? The context here seems to define ""log x"" as equivalent to ln x because it's using the term ""natural logarithm"". Therefore within this specific context they are the same. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,46.89783809997607,0.01645022081438054,0.004830123543871717,0.022979999979725108,4.165506660744237e-06,1.2230785240661736e-06
79,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if runs in Gin Rummy must be the same suit. Let me start by recalling what I know about Gin Rummy from the context provided.  The context mentions that there are two types of melds: sets and runs. Sets are three or four cards of the same rank like 8♥ 8♦ 8♠. Runs on the other hand are sequences of three or more cards in a row but they have to be of the same suit. For example it gives an instance of 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ as a valid run. It also clarifies that Aces are low so A♠ 2♠ 3♠ is okay but Q♠ K♠ A♠ isn't because Ace can only be the lowest in the sequence.  So from this it's clear that runs require all cards to be of the same suit. The example given uses hearts for the run and the invalid example with Queen King Ace shows that without the same suit it doesn't work. Therefore the key point is that runs must consist of consecutive numbers in the same suit.  I don't see any mention of runs being allowed to mix suits or have different suits. The context explicitly states that runs are sequences of the same suit. So if someone has a run with mixed suits it wouldn't be valid because each card in the run needs to share both rank and suit consecutively.  Therefore the answer should be True because runs do indeed need to be the same suit. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,46.18497600001865,0.016200951805963024,0.0047569330305101895,0.017435799993108958,4.296829442157307e-06,1.2616375966468582e-06
80,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if a cougar and a mountain lion are the same. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context says that the cougar also commonly known as the puma mountain lion panther or catamount. So right there it lists several names for the same animal. That makes me think that cougar and mountain lion are just different common names for the same species.  It also mentions that the scientific name is Puma concolor which is a large felid native to the Americas. The range is from Canada down to South America so it's widespread across the Americas. It talks about being an adaptable generalist species found in various habitats and notes that it's the biggest cat in North America after the jaguar.  The context also mentions that cougars are more closely related to smaller felines like domestic cats than to larger ones like jaguars. But all of this is just additional information about the cougar not distinguishing between cougar and mountain lion.  Since the text explicitly lists ""mountain lion"" as another name for the cougar it's clear they're the same animal. There's no indication that there are different species or subspecies being referred to here. So yes a cougar and a mountain lion are the same. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,45.02514050001628,0.015791003132707492,0.004636563659131325,0.02037949999794364,5.074212779840713e-06,1.4898933510423102e-06
81,<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether I need a visa to visit Oman based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that citizens of member nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council can travel to Oman without any visa restrictions. That means if someone is from one of those GCC countries they don't need a visa at all. But what about other nationalities?  It also mentions that nationals from 71 other countries and territories can apply for visas online which are valid for 30 days. So these people do need to get a visa before traveling.  Additionally it's stated that all visitors must have a passport that's valid for at least six months. That's a common requirement so regardless of whether you need a visa or not your passport needs to be valid beyond the usual 6-month period.  So putting this together: if I'm from a GCC country no visa is needed. If I'm from one of the other 71 countries I do need to apply for an online visa. Therefore the answer depends on my nationality. But the question is general asking whether you need a visa to visit Oman.  Since some people don't need a visa (GCC citizens) and others do the correct response would be that it's not always required but can be needed depending on your country of origin. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,45.73324929998489,0.016039725767768093,0.0047095937460253446,0.01791709999088198,4.431150551762484e-06,1.3010770401208191e-06

The context says that Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are the No. 1 selling candy brand in the U.S. and consist of a milk white or dark chocolate cup filled with peanut butter. They're marketed by The Hershey Company. It also mentions that H.B. Reese created them after leaving his job at Hershey to start his own business.

83,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Comcast and Time Warner Cable are the same company based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that the Department of Justice was planning to file an antitrust lawsuit against Comcast and Time Warner Cable because their merger would reduce competition. Then on April 24 2015 Comcast announced they were withdrawing their proposal to acquire TWC. After that TWC entered into an agreement to be acquired by Charter Communications.  From this I understand that at the time of the announcement Comcast was trying to buy Time Warner Cable but decided to pull out. Then Time Warner Cable ended up being bought by a different company Charter Communications. So before the merger attempt they were separate entities. The fact that the DOJ was suing both suggests they were distinct companies.  Therefore based on this information it's clear that Comcast and Time Warner Cable are not the same company. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,42.27745399996638,0.014830983786745508,0.004354682212199639,0.010431800008518621,2.4086444412306363e-06,7.072276023330654e-07
84,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the Falkland Islands are part of the Commonwealth based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says: ""As of April 2018 the Minister responsible for the Territories excluding the Falkland Islands Gibraltar and the Sovereign Base Areas is Tariq Ahmad Minister of State for the Commonwealth and the UN. The other three territories are the responsibility of Sir Alan Duncan MP Minister of State for Europe and the Americas.""  Hmm so it mentions that Tariq Ahmad is responsible for Territories excluding the Falkland Islands Gibraltar and the Sovereign Base Areas. That means these excluded places—Falklands Gibraltar and Sovereign Base Areas—are handled by someone else which in this case is Sir Alan Duncan.  Wait but the question is about whether the Falkland Islands are part of the Commonwealth. I know that the Commonwealth is a political association of member states many of which were former territories of the British Empire. The Falklands are a British Overseas Territory so they should be part of the UK but not necessarily members of the Commonwealth.  Looking at the context again Tariq Ahmad's role includes the Commonwealth and the UN. So maybe his portfolio covers the Commonwealth-related matters while Sir Alan handles other territories including the Falklands. But does that mean the Falklands are part of the Commonwealth?  I think the key point is whether the Falkland Islands themselves are members of the Commonwealth. I recall that the Falklands are a British Overseas Territory and their political status doesn't make them independent or a separate realm within the Commonwealth. Instead they're under the UK's jurisdiction.  So based on this context since Tariq Ahmad is responsible for the Commonwealth and the UN but the Falklands are excluded from his responsibilities and handled by Sir Alan it suggests that the Falklands aren't part of the Commonwealth because their affairs are managed separately. Therefore the answer should be False. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,45.820955100032734,0.016071067351986816,0.004718796280480368,0.017329399997834116,4.250012223848091e-06,1.2478910973769978e-06
85,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if a Quarter Pounder actually weighs a quarter of a pound. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context says that the Quarter Pounder is a hamburger from McDonald's and it was named because the patty weighs a quarter of a pound which is 113.4 grams. It first came out in 1971. Then in 2013 they expanded the line replacing their Angus burger. In 2015 McDonald's increased the weight to 4.25 ounces which converts to about 120.5 grams.  Wait a minute so originally it was a quarter pound (about 113g) but in 2015 they made it heavier—4.25 oz or roughly 120.5g. That's more than a quarter pound because a quarter pound is about 4 ounces (since 16 oz = 1 lb). So 4.25 oz is actually over a quarter pound.  So the question is asking if a Quarter Pounder weighs a quarter of a pound. But after 2015 it's more than that. However I should check when the context was written. The context mentions both the original and the updated weight. So does the current product still refer to the name ""Quarter Pounder"" despite the increased size?  I think so because McDonald's often keeps the names even after changing the recipe or ingredients. For example the Big Mac isn't two patties anymore in some places but it's still called that.  Therefore while originally it was a quarter pound now it's more. So technically does it still weigh a quarter? No it doesn't anymore. But maybe the question is referring to the original Quarter Pounder. Wait no—the context says in 2015 they increased it so the current version is heavier.  But the way the question is phrased: ""does a quarter pounder weight a quarter pound."" It's asking about the product as it exists now I think. So since they changed it to 4.25 oz (which is more than a quarter pound) the answer would be False because it no longer weighs exactly a quarter of a pound.  Wait but maybe in some regions or times it still does? The context doesn't specify that; it just says McDonald's increased it in 2015. So I think the correct answer is False. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,45.402759299991885,0.01592023010204723,0.004674507358134161,0.02037959999870509,5.098104443944369e-06,1.4969084355564625e-06
86,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Murphy Brown had a baby on the show based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that in the 1991-92 season of the show Murphy became pregnant. It mentions that her baby's father was Jake Lowenstein who was her ex-husband and an underground radical at the time. He didn't want to give up his lifestyle to be a parent so Murphy decided to have the child and raise it alone.  Additionally there's another detail about a baby shower where the guests were real-life journalists like Katie Couric Joan Lunden Paula Zahn Mary Alice Williams and Faith Daniels. These women treated Murphy and Corky (I assume Corky is another character) as friends and peers blending fiction with reality.  So putting this together the context explicitly states that Murphy became pregnant during that season and chose to have the baby despite Jake's reluctance. Therefore yes she did have a baby on the show. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,43.10967220002203,0.015125819155857152,0.004441251947279873,0.020857099996646866,5.181935556174722e-06,1.5215229762037714e-06
87,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the US has ever won the World Cup based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that the best result for the United States in a World Cup was reaching the semifinals in 1930. Then it mentions that in the modern era their best performance was getting to the quarterfinals in 2002. It also notes that they were eliminated in the first round in 1990 1998 and 2006.  So from this information I can see that the US has never gone beyond the semifinals or quarterfinals in any World Cup mentioned. There's no mention of them winning the tournament outright. The highest they've reached is the semifinals way back in 1930 but that doesn't mean they won it; it just means they made it to the final four.  In the modern era which I assume starts after World War II or maybe from 1960 onwards their best was quarterfinals. So no wins there either. The context also lists some years where they were eliminated early but that doesn't affect whether they've ever won.  Therefore putting it all together the US hasn't won the World Cup based on the provided context. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,44.854367500025546,0.01573085193711845,0.004618902029583307,0.03452240000478923,8.257924652144725e-06,2.4246967099052225e-06
88,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Illinois has a stand-your-ground law. The context provided lists several states that have adopted such laws through various means like case law jury instructions or other methods. Specifically the states mentioned are California Colorado Illinois New Mexico Oregon Virginia and Washington.  First I should understand what a stand-your-ground law is. From what I know these laws allow individuals to use force including deadly force in self-defense when they feel threatened without requiring them to retreat or flee the situation first. This is different from ""duty to retreat"" states where the person must try to escape before using force.  Looking at the context given Illinois is explicitly listed among the states that have adopted stand-your-ground laws. The mention includes states that have done so through case law jury instructions or other means. Since Illinois is on this list it suggests that the state recognizes stand-your-ground principles in its legal framework.  I should also consider whether there's any nuance here. Sometimes states might have similar self-defense laws but not explicitly called ""stand-your-ground."" However since the context directly includes Illinois it implies that the law exists there under this specific terminology or through related legal practices.  Therefore based on the provided information Illinois does have a stand-your-ground law. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,44.72890699998243,0.015684241532602842,0.004605216255101581,0.025712399976328015,6.606757790446041e-06,1.939880121511487e-06
89,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""fitness"" as used in biology and ""survival"" mean the same thing. Let me start by recalling what I know about these terms.  From the context provided Darwinian fitness is mentioned. It says that fitness doesn't include a measure of survival or lifespan. Instead it's about the ability to leave more copies of oneself in successive generations. The example given uses Herbert Spencer's phrase ""survival of the fittest "" which should be interpreted as the survival of the form (phenotypic or genotypic) that leaves the most copies.  So fitness here is not just about surviving but about reproducing and passing on genes. Survival alone doesn't capture the whole picture because even if an organism survives it might not reproduce. Fitness includes both survival and reproduction I think. So while survival is a part of fitness they aren't exactly the same.  The question is asking if fitness and survival have the same meaning in biology. Based on the context fitness isn't just about surviving; it's more about reproductive success. Therefore their meanings are different because fitness encompasses more than just staying alive—it's about leaving more copies of your genes. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,46.27832699997816,0.016230695892894383,0.0047656665068689106,0.0460245999856852,9.92378999653738e-06,2.9138290754620993e-06
90,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Britain has the right to bear arms based on the given context. Let me read the context again carefully.  The context says that the right to keep and bear arms is not legally or constitutionally protected in the United Kingdom. It also mentions that most handguns automatic and centerfire semi-automatic weapons are illegal to possess without special permission.   So from this I understand that unlike some other countries the UK doesn't have a constitutional or legal guarantee for people to own guns. Most types of firearms are restricted unless you have specific reasons like maybe for sports or professional use.  The question is asking if Britain has the right to bear arms. Based on what's written it seems clear that they don't. The context explicitly states there's no such right protected in law or constitution. Therefore the answer should be False because the UK doesn't recognize a general right to bear arms for its citizens. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,43.863190300005954,0.015385545270636255,0.004517512882382713,0.023373400006676093,5.878114999278397e-06,1.7259355951489835e-06
91,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if thread seal tape and Teflon tape are the same. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context says that thread seal tape is also known as PTFE tape or plumber's tape. It mentions that it's a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film tape used in plumbing for sealing pipe threads. So right off the bat I see that thread seal tape and PTFE tape are the same thing.  Then it refers to Teflon tape as another name for it. But wait there's more. The context also notes that while Teflon is identical to PTFE Chemours (the trademark holders) consider this usage incorrect especially since they don't manufacture Teflon in tape form anymore.  So even though people commonly call it Teflon tape the company doesn't approve of that name. However from a functional standpoint thread seal tape and Teflon tape are both made of PTFE and serve the same purpose. They're used for sealing pipe threads lubricating preventing seizing etc.  Therefore despite the trademark issues in common usage they are treated as the same product. The context doesn't provide any differences in their composition or function; it's more about the branding. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,45.61228589998791,0.01600301599893487,0.004698815002035694,0.02358269999967888,5.970457268256978e-06,1.7530491866636985e-06
92,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is part of the Constitution. Let me start by recalling what I know about both documents.  The U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the land establishing the framework for the government and outlining the fundamental principles of the country. It includes amendments that have been added over time to address various issues such as civil rights.  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 on the other hand is a piece of legislation passed by Congress. I remember it was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson and it addresses discrimination based on race color religion sex or national origin. It covers areas like employment public accommodations and voting rights.  Now to determine if the Civil Rights Act is in the Constitution I should consider how laws are structured. The Constitution consists of articles and amendments that have been ratified by either Congress or state conventions. Statutory laws like the Civil Rights Act are passed by Congress but aren't part of the Constitution itself unless they're specifically incorporated through an amendment.  Looking at the context provided it mentions that the Civil Rights Act was enacted as Pub.L. 88--352 and is codified in the U.S. Code. This indicates it's a federal law not a constitutional amendment. The Constitution doesn't list specific laws; instead it provides the authority for Congress to pass such legislation.  Therefore since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 isn't an amendment to the Constitution but rather a statute passed by Congress it's not part of the Constitution. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,48.4135008000012,0.016982722092304326,0.0049864768833596,0.013962199998786673,3.317698887743366e-06,9.741447054107332e-07

That name was chosen by James Cook in honor of John Montagu who was the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time. The current name comes from the largest island Hawaii Island.

From the context it says that the film was produced by Gary Ross and Allison Thomas. It also mentions that it was released by Universal Pictures on December 19 2008. The production companies listed are Universal Animation Studios Framestore Feature Animation and Relativity Media.   I know that Disney typically produces its own animated films through their animation studios like Walt Disney Animation Studios or Pixar. Since the context doesn't mention Disney being involved in any way—neither as a producer nor as a distributor—it seems clear that this movie isn't a Disney production.  Additionally Universal Pictures is the distributor here which is a different major studio from Disney.

95,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the County Court Business Centre (CCBC) is a real court based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that CCBC is a center of the County Court of England and Wales created to handle claims using various electronic media. It also mentions that unlike other County Court centers CCBC doesn't physically hear cases. If a case requires a hearing it's transferred to another center.  So from this I understand that CCBC isn't where actual court hearings take place. Instead it deals with claims through electronic means. That makes me think it's more of an administrative or processing center rather than a real courtroom where trials or proceedings happen.  Therefore since the CCBC doesn't physically hear cases and handles claims electronically without a physical presence for court proceedings it wouldn't be considered a real court in the traditional sense. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,44.65186559999711,0.015658037069773832,0.0045975220852607565,0.021503199997823685,4.248433903468414e-06,1.2474276700156467e-06
96,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether a batter gets an RBI on a fielder's choice based on the provided context. Let me read the context carefully.  The context says that the official scorer must decide if a run batted in (RBI) is credited when a runner scores due to a fielder holding the ball or throwing it to the wrong base. It mentions two scenarios:   1. If the runner keeps going the scorer should credit an RBI. 2. If the runner stops and takes off again upon noticing the misplay then the run is scored on a fielder's choice.  So in the first case the runner doesn't stop but continues leading to an RBI being credited. In the second case the runner stops and restarts because of the error which results in the run being attributed to a fielder's choice instead of an RBI.  The question is asking specifically if a batter gets an RBI on a fielder's choice. From the context it seems that when the runner notices the misplay and takes off again (fielder's choice) the run isn't credited as an RBI but rather as a fielder's choice. Therefore in this scenario the batter does not get an RBI because the run is scored due to the fielder's error not the batter's hit resulting in a run.  So the answer should be False because when it's a fielder's choice (the runner stops and restarts) the RBI isn't credited; instead it's considered a fielder's choice play. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,48.830821200012,0.017129132382345178,0.005029465959127701,0.031714499986264855,8.159135555292273e-06,2.3956901969854854e-06
97,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether quantum entanglement can transfer information faster than light. The context provided says that it's well understood that quantum entanglement doesn't allow any influence or information to propagate superluminally. It mentions the microscopic causality postulate in axiomatic quantum field theory which implies you can't have superluminal communication using phenomena described by orthodox quantum field theory.  There's also a special case called the no-communication theorem which stops communication via entanglement between two observers who are spacelike-separated. Some authors argue that using this theorem to say you can't communicate faster than light is circular because the theorem assumes the system is composite. But regardless of that argument the main point from the context is clear: quantum entanglement doesn't allow information transfer at superluminal speeds.  So putting it all together the answer should be False. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,41.09756679998827,0.014416582135175448,0.004233005354700068,0.04642050000256859,1.0123079438764963e-05,2.9723445591027217e-06
98,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the United States was still making $2 bills in 2018 based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context mentions that the $2 bill features Thomas Jefferson on the front and an engraving of John Trumbull's painting on the back. It goes into detail about the history of the bill including different types it was issued as before 1929 like United States Notes National Bank Notes etc. Then it says that after changing to current size it was only issued as a United States Note until production stopped in 1966.  Wait so from 1966 onward they didn't produce the $2 bill? But then it continues: Ten years passed before it was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design. So that would be 1976 right? Because ten years after 1966 is 1976.  The context also mentions that production went on until 1966 and then it was reissued in the 1970s. It says that two-dollar bills are seldom seen because of banking policies leading to low production due to lack of demand. But they're still being produced just not as much.  So in 2018 which is well after 1976 were they still making $2 bills? The context doesn't explicitly say that production stopped after a certain year beyond 1966 and then resumed in the 70s. It does mention that they are still being produced but in low numbers because of lack of demand.  Therefore yes they were still making $2 bills in 2018. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,49.38577549997717,0.017332611148500026,0.005089211514532242,0.03159839997533709,8.123335553035658e-06,2.385178579194971e-06
99,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Call of Duty: World at War is part of the Black Ops series. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context says that World at War was developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. It was released in 2008 for several platforms like PC PS3 Xbox 360 Wii DS PS2 and Windows Mobile. Importantly it's noted as the fifth mainstream game in the Call of Duty series and that it returns to World War II setting.  Now the key part is this: ""It is also the first title in the Black Ops story line."" So according to the context World at War introduced the Black Ops storyline. That means it's indeed part of the Black Ops series because it starts the story that subsequent Black Ops games would continue.  I should make sure I'm not confusing it with other Call of Duty games. The main series usually has Modern Warfare and others set in modern times but Black Ops is a subseries within Call of Duty. Since World at War is the first in Black Ops it's definitely part of that line. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,45.074247100012144,0.015815975437538047,0.004643896042013466,0.034936899988679215,9.083770037623117e-06,2.667181919374868e-06
100,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether tonic water and quinine water are the same thing based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that tonic water is a carbonated soft drink with dissolved quinine. It was originally used to prevent malaria but now has less quinine and is enjoyed for its bitter taste similar to sour grapefruit. It's often used in mixed drinks like gin and tonic.  Now the question is asking if tonic water and quinine water are the same thing. From what I understand tonic water does contain quinine as mentioned in the first sentence. But is there a separate term called ""quinine water""?  I don't see any mention of ""quinine water"" in the context provided. The context refers to it as tonic water specifically mentioning that it's a carbonated soft drink with quinine dissolved in it. There's no indication that ""quinine water"" is another name for the same thing.  So based on this I think they are not the same. Tonic water contains quinine but ""quinine water"" isn't mentioned here as a separate entity. Therefore the answer should be False. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,43.34431849999237,0.015207521311538236,0.004465241382448748,0.022318200004519895,5.68105056057296e-06,1.6680734183556538e-06
101,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's such a thing as Corinthian leather based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that Corinthian leather was a term created by Bozell an advertising agency for Chrysler luxury vehicles. It first appeared in ads in 1974. The term makes it sound like it has a connection to Corinth but there's no real link; it's just a marketing idea.  So the question is asking if such a thing as Corinthian leather exists. From what I understand it was made up for marketing purposes. There isn't an actual historical or real-world origin from Corinth. It's purely a brand name to make their products sound more luxurious.  Therefore even though the term is used and people might think it refers to a real type of leather in reality it doesn't exist outside of that marketing campaign. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,43.30544080000254,0.015197562977024334,0.0044623174103917106,0.012030799989588559,2.7641294433528347e-06,8.116053184511803e-07
102,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's a playoff for third place in the World Cup based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that the knockout stage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup had a round of 16 and ended with the final on July 15th at Luzhniki Stadium. It mentions that the top two teams from each group advanced making it 16 teams in total. The tournament was single-elimination which means once you lose you're out.  Then importantly it states that a third place playoff was held between the two losing semi-final teams. So after the semifinals where four teams play the losers of those games go on to compete for third place. That makes sense because in many tournaments including the FIFA World Cup they have this consolation match to determine who gets third and fourth places.  So based on that information yes there is a playoff for third place.

103,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if any of the original members of Lynyrd Skynyrd are still alive based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context starts by mentioning that on October 20 1977 three days after the release of their fifth studio album ""Street Survivors "" a chartered plane carrying the band members and crew crashed in Gillsburg Mississippi. This crash resulted in six deaths including Ronnie Van Zant Steve Gaines and Cassie Gaines. Many others were seriously injured with Wilkeson being left in critical condition and reportedly declared dead three times.  After the crash the group disbanded. Then in 1978 a collection of unreleased recordings from 1971 and 1972 was released as ""Skynyrd's First and... Last."" The following year the surviving members (excluding Wilkeson) reunited at Volunteer Jam for a performance of ""Free Bird"" with Charlie Daniels and his band.  So focusing on the original members: Ronnie Van Zant Steve Gaines Cassie Gaines and others. From the crash details it's clear that these three died in the accident. The context also mentions that after the crash the group disbanded which implies that many of the original members were lost.  However Wilkeson was seriously injured but survived. He was declared dead three times but recovered. So he is still alive. Additionally other surviving members reunited later so there are definitely some original members alive.  Therefore considering all this yes some original members of Lynyrd Skynyrd are still alive. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,45.94464750000043,0.0161181137290747,0.004732610065486063,0.04025400002137758,1.0490714445930078e-05,3.080289766872052e-06
104,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the statement ""is there no sales tax in New Hampshire"" is true or false based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that since January 2017 five states don't levy a statewide sales tax. These states are Alaska Delaware Montana New Hampshire and Oregon. It also mentions that California has the highest state sales tax at 7.25% and some counties and cities in California add more taxes making the total over 11%. Puerto Rico is noted to have a higher VAT rate.  So focusing on New Hampshire: it's listed among the five states without a statewide sales tax. That means at the state level they don't impose sales tax. However I should consider if there are local sales taxes in some areas of New Hampshire. The context doesn't mention anything about local taxes for these no-sales-tax states so maybe they don't have any additional taxes.  Therefore since New Hampshire is one of the five without a statewide sales tax the statement that there's no sales tax in New Hampshire should be true. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,41.89560989997699,0.014707214004941967,0.004318340855821824,0.026349099993240088,6.702933333833705e-06,1.9681192413204636e-06
105,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""San Luis Rey de Francia"" was always a mission. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context mentions that in 1834 there was a secularization of the mission which led to no religious services being held and the Luiseño people being left behind as the Franciscan padres fled. Then in 1893 two Mexican priests were given permission to restore the Mission as a Franciscan college. Father Joseph O'Keefe was assigned as an interpreter and began restoring the old Mission in 1895. The quadrangle and church were completed by 1905. San Luis Rey College was opened as a seminary in 1950 but closed in 1969.  So from this I can see that initially it was a mission under the Franciscans until 1834 when it was secularized. After that it wasn't functioning as a mission anymore because there were no religious services. Then in 1893 efforts began to restore it and by 1905 parts of it were restored. It became San Luis Rey College in 1950 which was a seminary until 1969.  The question is whether it was always a mission. The key point here is that after 1834 the Mission as an active religious institution ceased to exist for a time. It wasn't functioning as a mission during that period but was later restored and repurposed into a college and seminary. So while it started as a mission it wasn't always one because there was a period where it wasn't operational as such.  Therefore the answer should be False because it wasn't continuously a mission; there were times when it wasn't functioning as a mission. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,43.740336200018646,0.015357940005578606,0.00450940740816481,0.017797399981645867,4.358180549914121e-06,1.2796515451137232e-06
106,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Kristen Bell sang all the voices of Anna in the movie Frozen. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context says that Princess Anna is a character from Disney's Frozen. She's voiced by Kristen Bell as an adult. Then it mentions that Livvy Stubenrauch and Katie Lopez provided her speaking and singing voice as a young child respectively. Additionally Agatha Lee Monn portrayed her as a nine-year-old (singing).  So breaking this down: Kristen Bell is the adult Anna's voice actress. For the younger versions of Anna different actresses were used for speaking and singing. Livvy did the speaking part when she was a young child and Katie Lopez did the singing for that age. Then there's Agatha Lee Monn who sang as a nine-year-old.  The question is asking if Kristen Bell sang all the voices of Anna. From the context it seems clear that she only voiced the adult version. The younger versions had different voice actors both for speaking and singing parts. Therefore Kristen Bell didn't sing for all the voices of Anna; she only did the adult one.  I think the answer is False because she didn't handle the singing for the child versions. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,42.59405470002093,0.014951217571399304,0.0043899853270075225,0.02037189999828115,5.129498940285751e-06,1.5061265061001687e-06

The context says that ""The fourteenth season of the American television medical drama Grey's Anatomy was ordered on February 10 2017 by American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and premiered on September 28 2017 with a special two-hour premiere."" So it clearly states that the 14th season was ordered. That means ABC decided to produce another season after the thirteenth.  Additionally it mentions that the season consists of 24 episodes which is typical for Grey's Anatomy seasons. It also notes some details about production companies and showrunners but those aren't directly relevant to whether the season exists or not.

The context talks about ""Total Divas "" not ""Total Bellas."" It mentions that Paige announced the renewal for a fourth season in February 2015 with filming starting at the end of that month and the premiere on July 7 2015. So it's clear that Total Divas was renewed for Season 4.  Now the question is about ""Total Bellas."" I know that ""Total Bellas"" is a different reality TV series produced by WWE focusing on The Bella Twins (Brie and Nikki Bella) after their time in WWE. It first aired in 2016 so it's a more recent show compared to Total Divas.  The context provided doesn't mention anything about Total Bellas at all. It only discusses the renewal of Total Divas for its fourth season. There's no information here that would suggest whether Total Bellas has been renewed or not. Since the context is specific to Total Divas I can't infer any details about Total Bellas from it.  Therefore based solely on the given context there's no indication of a Season 4 for Total Bellas.

109,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the October Revolution is the same as the Bolshevik Revolution. Let me start by recalling what I know about these events.  The October Revolution was a significant event in Russian history. From the context provided it's mentioned that it occurred in 1917 and was led by the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin. It took place in Petrograd on November 7th (October 25th in the old calendar). This revolution is also referred to by other names like Red October or the Bolshevik Coup.  The term ""Bolshevik Revolution"" seems closely related because it's specified that the October Revolution was led by the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks were a Marxist revolutionary group and their leader was Lenin. So when we talk about the Bolshevik Revolution it's essentially referring to the same event as the October Revolution but from the perspective of the Bolsheviks' leadership.  Looking at the context again it says that the October Revolution is also known as the Great October Socialist Revolution in Soviet literature which further solidifies that it's the same event. The other names listed—October Uprising Bolshevik Revolution or Bolshevik Coup—all point to the same historical occurrence.  Therefore considering all these references and the direct mention of the Bolsheviks leading the October Revolution it makes sense that they are the same event. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,43.96421370000462,0.015434677855217151,0.004531939220863713,0.011941999982809648,2.7850155547235367e-06,8.177379107981089e-07

The context says that Jan Struther wrote this Christian hymn which was published in 1931. It mentions that it's used in liturgy at weddings and at the beginning of funeral services. So from this I can see that the hymn has multiple uses: liturgical purposes weddings and funerals.  The question is specifically asking if it's a funeral hymn. The context explicitly states that it's used at the beginning of funeral services. That seems to indicate that it's commonly associated with funerals. However it's also used in other contexts like weddings and general liturgy so it's not exclusively a funeral hymn.  But the question is whether it's a funeral hymn not if it's only used for funerals. Since it's definitely used at funerals even if it has other uses I think the answer would be True because it serves that purpose. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,42.59077020001132,0.01495050933772075,0.00438977737501685,0.01773189997766167,4.3443049950939085e-06,1.2755773965185382e-06
111,<think> Okay I need to determine if a peck is the same as a bushel based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that a peck is equivalent to 2 dry gallons or 8 dry quarts etc. and mentions that two pecks make a kenning (which is obsolete) while four pecks make a bushel. So if one peck equals 4 pecks in a bushel then a peck is not the same as a bushel; instead it's a fraction of a bushel.  Therefore the answer should be False because a peck is smaller than a bushel. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,44.614072099968325,0.015663357266702,0.004599084204622602,0.014200100005837157,3.403093891554615e-06,9.9921843682698e-07
112,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the heat from a hair dryer can kill lice. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context says that a standard home blow dryer kills 96.7% of eggs with proper technique. It also mentions that it needs to be used repeatedly every 1 to 7 days because lice eggs take about 7 to 10 days to hatch. The process should continue for about four weeks which is the natural life cycle of the lice.  So from this I understand that using a hair dryer can kill a significant number of lice eggs. But does it actually kill the lice themselves? Well lice have a life cycle and if you're targeting their eggs then yes killing 96.7% of them is effective. However the question is about whether the heat kills lice in general.  Wait but the context specifically talks about eggs. It doesn't explicitly say that it kills adult lice. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The hair dryer's heat can kill eggs by desiccating them or making the environment too hot for them to survive. But what about the actual lice? Do they die from the heat as well?  I know that lice are small insects and their bodies might be able to withstand some heat but I'm not sure. The context doesn't mention killing adult lice directly only the eggs. So maybe the hair dryer's heat isn't effective against the adults or perhaps it is.  Wait no if you're using a blow dryer on your scalp the heat might be too much for the lice to handle. They can't survive high temperatures so the heat would kill them as well. But the context only mentions eggs because that's where they spend most of their time attached to the hair.  So putting it together: The hair dryer kills 96.7% of eggs which are part of the lice life cycle. Since the process needs to be repeated every week for a month it suggests that while some eggs might survive each session over time they're all killed. But does this mean the heat kills the lice themselves? I think so because if you remove their eggs and kill them with heat the adults would also die.  Wait but maybe the context is only talking about eggs because that's where they are most vulnerable. So perhaps the hair dryer primarily targets the eggs not the adult lice. But in reality using a blow dryer on your scalp would likely kill any lice present as well because of the heat.  Hmm I'm a bit confused now. The context says it kills 96.7% of eggs but doesn't specify if it affects adults. However since the process is repeated every week for four weeks maybe it's to ensure that all life stages are targeted including any hatched lice. So yes the heat would kill both eggs and adult lice.  Therefore the answer should be True because the hair dryer's heat can indeed kill lice by targeting their eggs and likely the adults as well. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,51.012864900025306,0.017914382731933323,0.005260031630201462,0.009017400006996468,2.0322255533149777e-06,5.967032663138167e-07
113,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if cougars and mountain lions are the same. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context says that the cougar also commonly known as the puma mountain lion panther or catamount. So right there it lists several names for the same animal. That makes me think they're all referring to the same species.  It mentions that the cougar is a large felid native to the Americas and gives its scientific name Puma concolor. It also talks about the range from Canada to South America and describes it as an adaptable generalist species. All these details are about one animal with multiple common names.  The context doesn't mention any differences between cougars and mountain lions; instead it treats them as synonyms. So based on this I can conclude that they're the same. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,46.05111729999771,0.01617420159410137,0.004749078617516319,0.02053780001006089,5.152795038858373e-06,1.5129667203116164e-06
114,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if someone can die from a bullet that's been shot into the air. Let me start by understanding the context provided.  The context says that bullets fired into the air usually have lower terminal velocities than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel. That makes sense because once they're up there gravity starts pulling them back down and they slow down as they go up but speed up again on the way down though not as fast as when they were shot.  But then it mentions that people can be injured or even killed by bullets falling back to the ground. So despite having lower terminal velocities they still pose a danger. That's interesting because I might have thought that if a bullet is going up and comes back down maybe it loses enough speed that it wouldn't be lethal anymore.  The context also talks about angles less than vertical being more dangerous. It explains that bullets fired at these angles maintain their trajectory without tumbling so they stay at higher speeds compared to those in free fall. Tumbling would slow them down more because of air resistance and other factors but if they keep moving in a straight path they retain more speed.  So putting this together: even though the bullet's terminal velocity is lower than when it was fired it can still be dangerous because it doesn't lose as much speed when traveling at certain angles. This means that when it comes back down it could still hit someone with enough force to cause serious injury or death.  I should also consider how high the bullet goes and how long it stays in the air. The higher the angle the longer it takes to come back down but if it's fired at a less than vertical angle it might not go as high and could still be moving fast enough when it lands.  In real-life scenarios I've heard of incidents where people have been injured or killed by bullets that were shot into the air. This aligns with what the context is saying. So even though the bullet isn't traveling at its initial muzzle velocity anymore it's still capable of causing fatal injuries upon impact.  Therefore based on the context provided the answer should be 'True' because it explicitly states that people can sometimes die from bullets discharged into the air. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,50.188884000031976,0.01763251179447517,0.005177268519194487,0.02136610000161454,5.373972220210513e-06,1.5779088948313805e-06
115,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the hand A-2-3-4-5 is considered a straight in poker. Let me start by recalling what a straight is. In poker a straight is five cards of sequential rank. The key here is understanding how aces are treated.  From the context provided it says that an ace can be high or low depending on the rules. Under high rules an ace can be either above a king (high) or below a two (low). So for example A-2-3-4-5 would be considered a straight where the ace is acting as a low card making it a five-high straight.  Wait but I should check if there are any specific rules mentioned that might affect this. The context talks about different rule variations: high rules deuce-to-seven low ace-to-six low and ace-to-five low. Under high rules the ace can be both high or low so A-2-3-4-5 would indeed form a straight.  However under some low rules like ace-to-six or ace-to-five the ace might only rank low but in those cases it's more about how straights are recognized. But since the question is just asking if it's a straight without specifying the rule set I think by default in high rules A-2-3-4-5 is considered a valid straight.  I don't see any mention that would invalidate this hand as a straight under standard poker rules. So yes it should be a straight. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,46.91735410000547,0.01647995697233644,0.0048388546921199855,0.08540279997396283,2.317108470148285e-05,6.8035075648249034e-06

117,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if ""Vertical Limit"" is based on a true story. Let me start by recalling what I know about the movie. It's a 2000 American survival thriller directed by Martin Campbell and written by Robert King. The main actors include Chris O'Donnell Bill Paxton Robin Tunney and Scott Glenn.  I remember that ""Vertical Limit"" is about mountain climbers who get stranded on Mount Everest during a storm. They have to survive the harsh conditions while dealing with personal conflicts and the dangers of the mountain. Now I'm trying to think if this story is based on real events or if it's entirely fictional.  From what I know there are several true stories about people surviving extreme mountaineering accidents. For example the 1996 Mount Everest disaster where many climbers died due to bad weather and altitude issues. However ""Vertical Limit"" doesn't seem to be directly based on that specific event because the plot focuses more on a group of climbers with different dynamics rather than recreating a historical incident.  I also think about other movies like ""Everest "" which is inspired by real events. But in the case of ""Vertical Limit "" I don't recall any direct connection to actual true stories. The movie seems to be more of an fictional thriller using the setting of Mount Everest as a backdrop for survival and drama.  Additionally looking at the context provided it mentions that the film was released by Columbia Pictures and received mixed reviews. There's no indication in this information that the story is based on real events. The plot elements such as the climbers' struggles and conflicts are typical of thriller movies and don't necessarily reflect true occurrences.  So putting it all together I think ""Vertical Limit"" isn't a true story but rather a fictional film meant to create suspense and drama around mountaineering. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,52.736653499974636,0.01853041479589883,0.005440911328383904,0.05336699998588301,1.4100928326661233e-05,4.140322897156126e-06
118,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether it's possible to buy alcohol on Sunday in Wisconsin based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that state law requires bars to be closed between certain hours. Specifically from 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. Monday through Friday and from 2:30 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday. So on Sundays the closing time is earlier than other days.  But wait there are exceptions mentioned. New Year's Eve doesn't require bars to close which probably means they can stay open that night. Also changes in Daylight Saving Time might affect closing hours but I'm not sure how that plays into it.  The context also mentions that municipalities cannot further restrict when bars must be closed beyond what state law says. However municipalities can choose to make themselves dry by prohibiting liquor licenses. So if a city does that you can't buy alcohol there at all.  But the question is about buying alcohol on Sunday in Wisconsin. The state law doesn't mention any prohibition against selling alcohol on Sundays; it only talks about closing hours for bars. So unless a specific municipality has made itself dry people should be able to buy alcohol on Sundays during normal business hours just not after 2:30 a.m. until 6:00 a.m.  I don't see any information in the context that outright bans alcohol sales on Sundays; it's more about the operating hours of bars. Therefore unless there's a local law making the area dry you can buy alcohol on Sunday. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,49.51248650002526,0.01739902976568942,0.005108713388109371,0.014256800001021475,3.409270560928392e-06,1.0010320341337658e-06
119,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the liver is part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Let me start by recalling what I know about the GI tract and the liver's role in digestion.  From the context provided the GI tract includes structures from the mouth to the anus which are a continuous passage. It mentions that the human GI tract consists of the esophagus stomach and intestines divided into upper and lower tracts. The text also notes that the complete digestive system includes both the GI tract and accessory organs like the tongue salivary glands pancreas liver and gallbladder.  So the key point here is that while the GI tract itself refers to the tube from mouth to anus the digestive system as a whole includes other organs. The context explicitly lists the liver as one of these accessory organs. Therefore the liver isn't part of the GI tract but is an accessory organ within the broader digestive system.  I should also consider if there's any ambiguity in the terms. Sometimes people might confuse accessory organs with parts of the GI tract but according to the context they're separate. The GI tract is just the pathway for food digestion and waste elimination while accessory organs aid in breaking down food but aren't part of that tube.  So putting it all together since the liver is listed as an accessory organ and not part of the structures between mouth and anus the answer should be False. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,50.6232253999915,0.017790839412395232,0.005223756767807678,0.012000699993222952,2.982665036900221e-06,8.757718684007386e-07
120,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if a person can have twins with different fathers based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context starts by explaining superfecundation which is when two or more ova are fertilized from the same cycle by sperm from separate sexual acts. This can lead to twin babies from two different biological fathers. It mentions that heteropaternal superfecundation refers to fertilizing two ova with different fathers while homopaternal is from the same father leading to fraternal twins.  So the key point here is that heteropaternal superfecundation results in twins with different fathers. The context also notes that this is a form of atypical twinning and that genetically the twins are half-siblings.  Therefore based on this information it's clear that yes a person can have twins with different fathers through heteropaternal superfecundation. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,48.60804600000847,0.0170827525042269,0.005015847871942806,0.023924000008264557,6.014056117015166e-06,1.7658507063666154e-06
121,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether anyone can give last rites in an emergency based on the provided context. Let me read the context carefully.  The context explains that the Anointing of the Sick is a sacrament given by the Catholic Church. It mentions that this sacrament provides grace for people who are sick and helps them through their sickness. The sacrament gives a gift of the Holy Spirit renewing their faith and confidence in God and strengthens them against temptations like discouragement despair and anguish related to death.  Importantly it states that one effect of the sacrament is absolving the recipient of any sins not previously forgiven through the sacrament of penance. Because of this only an ordained priest or bishop may administer the sacrament. So from this I understand that administering the Anointing of the Sick requires ordination as a priest or bishop.  Now the question is about whether anyone can give last rites in an emergency. Last rites are typically associated with the Anointing of the Sick especially when someone is near death. The context clearly says that only priests or bishops can administer this sacrament because it has the effect of absolving sins. There's no mention of laypeople or others being able to do so even in emergencies.  Therefore based on the context provided it seems that only ordained clergy can give last rites which are part of the Anointing of the Sick sacrament. So the answer should be False because not anyone can administer it; it requires a priest or bishop. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,52.935467800009064,0.01860766051713405,0.00546359226264075,0.013978400005726144,3.3156644470485237e-06,9.73547351733257e-07
122,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the common femoral vein is a deep vein based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says ""The femoral vein is considered a deep vein unlike the adjective superficial suggests and has led some physicians to falsely conclude it is a superficial vein..."" Hmm wait that's a bit confusing. The sentence structure might be tricky here. It starts by stating that the femoral vein is a deep vein but then mentions that the adjective ""superficial"" suggests otherwise? That doesn't quite make sense because ""superficial"" would imply it's near the surface which contradicts being a deep vein.  Wait maybe I misread it. Let me parse it again: ""The femoral vein is considered a deep vein unlike the adjective superficial suggests..."" Oh perhaps there's a typo or misplaced word here. Maybe it should say that some people incorrectly think it's superficial because of its name? Because ""femoral"" refers to the thigh not necessarily whether it's deep or superficial.  So according to the context the femoral vein is indeed a deep vein. However some physicians have mistakenly thought it's a superficial vein because they might confuse the term or perhaps due to other reasons. This mistake has led to patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) not receiving proper treatment like anticoagulants or thrombolytics.  Therefore based on the context provided the common femoral vein is classified as a deep vein. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,49.33227810001699,0.01735521298052512,0.005095847877790272,0.0254142000048887,6.208269441978903e-06,1.822875737460478e-06
123,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Garfield is a real cat in the movie based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that Garfield: The Movie is an American family comedy film from 2004 directed by Peter Hewitt and inspired by Jim Davis' comic strip. It mentions that Breckin Meyer plays Jon Arbuckle Jennifer Love Hewitt as Dr. Liz Wilson and Bill Murray provides the voice for Garfield.  Then it says ""Garfield was created with computer animation though all other animals were real."" Hmm so Garfield is animated while the other animals in the movie are real. That makes sense because often in movies especially those involving talking animals some characters might be CGI (computer-generated imagery) while others could be live animals or perhaps also CGI.  So the key point here is that Garfield was created using computer animation. Therefore he's not a real cat; he's an animated character. The other animals were real but Garfield himself isn't.   I should make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The context explicitly states that Garfield was created with computer animation so it's clear that he's not real. Even though the movie is live-action (since it stars human actors and mentions real animals) Garfield stands out as an animated character.  Therefore the answer should be False because Garfield isn't a real cat in the movie—he's animated. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,53.08848250002484,0.018674956833566094,0.005483351846787495,0.01890819999971427,4.6782155595590466e-06,1.3736204135192976e-06
124,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the internal resistance of a battery changes based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context says that a battery can be modeled as a voltage source in series with a resistance. It mentions that the internal resistance depends on several factors like size chemical properties age temperature and discharge current. That already suggests that the resistance isn't constant because it varies with these different conditions.  It also breaks down the internal resistance into two components: electronic and ionic. The electronic part is due to the resistivity of materials which might change with temperature or other factors. The ionic component involves electrolyte conductivity ion mobility and electrode surface area—so all of these can vary over time or under different conditions.  The context further mentions that measuring internal resistance gives a guide to the battery's condition but notes that this measurement is specific to test conditions. This implies that the resistance isn't fixed; it can change depending on when and how you measure it.  Additionally it talks about using an alternating current at 1 kHz for measurement which might not capture slower electrochemical processes accurately. So if the frequency affects the measured resistance that means the actual resistance could be different under other conditions or frequencies.  Finally there's a specific example given: a fresh Energizer E91 AA alkaline battery has an internal resistance of about 0.9 Ω at -40°C and drops to 0.15 Ω at room temperature then further down to 0.1 Ω at 40°C. This clear variation with temperature alone shows that the internal resistance changes.  Putting it all together the context provides multiple reasons why internal resistance isn't static—it varies with factors like temperature discharge current age and measurement conditions. The example with different temperatures clearly demonstrates this change. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,52.1127994999697,0.018327865025943465,0.005381438545391717,0.021747999999206513,5.445581108667992e-06,1.598934738921363e-06
125,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""The Young and the Restless"" is going off the air based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  First it says that since its debut the show has won nine Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series. That's a good sign of its success. It also mentions that it's currently the highest-rated daytime drama on American television. High ratings usually mean the show is doing well and likely to continue.  Next the context talks about its Nielsen ratings. As of 2008 it had been at the top for over 1 000 weeks since 1988. That's a long time! Then as of December 12 2013 it was leading with an unprecedented 1 300 weeks which is about 25 years. These numbers indicate sustained popularity and success over decades.  It also mentions that the show is a sister series to ""The Bold and the Beautiful "" with some crossover of actors. While this doesn't directly relate to whether it's going off the air it shows that the show has established connections and perhaps a stable position in the industry.  Finally in June 2017 the show was renewed for three additional years. Renewal is a strong indicator that the network believes in the show's future and plans to keep it on air. Three more years is a significant commitment suggesting no immediate plans to cancel.  Putting this all together: The show has been around for decades consistently high-rated award-winning and recently renewed. There's no mention of any plans to stop airing or any issues that might lead to cancellation. Therefore the answer should be False because it's not going off the air. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,52.68807239999296,0.018543871219491154,0.005444862411420599,0.024015700008021668,6.057875000341381e-06,1.7787168327492532e-06
126,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if ""The Greatest Showman"" is based on a true story. Let me start by recalling what I know about the movie. It's a musical film from 2017 directed by Michael Gracey and stars Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum. The context provided mentions that it's inspired by Barnum's creation of the Barnum & Bailey Circus and the lives of its star attractions.  I remember that P.T. Barnum was a real person known for his circuses and museums so there's definitely some historical basis here. However I also know that movies often take creative liberties with history to make them more entertaining or fit into a two-hour runtime. For example characters might be exaggerated events altered or scenes added that didn't happen.  Looking at the context again it says the film is ""inspired"" by Barnum's story. The word ""inspired"" suggests that while there's historical basis it's not strictly a factual account. They took elements from his life and the circus but probably added fictionalized parts to make it more dramatic for the movie.  I should also consider if any major events or people in the film are portrayed accurately. I think some of the main attractions of Barnum's circus were real like Jumbo the elephant but again their portrayals might be exaggerated. The relationships and dialogues would likely be fictionalized to create a compelling narrative.  So putting it all together while ""The Greatest Showman"" is loosely based on P.T. Barnum's life and his circus it's not entirely a true story. It uses historical figures and events as inspiration but includes creative elements for storytelling purposes. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,53.81939269998111,0.018940350188270665,0.0055612768002218605,0.04478289998951368,1.170496001962249e-05,3.436817268825502e-06
127,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the cortex of the cerebellum is gray matter. Let me start by recalling what I know about the brain's structure. The cerebellum is part of the brain and it has something called a cortex which I think refers to its outer layer.  From the context provided it says that grey matter is distributed at the surface of the cerebral hemispheres (cerebral cortex) and of the cerebellum (cerebellar cortex). So the cerebellar cortex is explicitly mentioned as having grey matter. That seems straightforward.  I should also consider what grey matter consists of. Grey matter includes regions where神经元的细胞体（neuron cell bodies）are concentrated along with dendrites and axons. In contrast white matter consists mostly of myelinated axon fibers that transmit signals between different parts of the brain.  Looking back at the context it lists various areas where grey matter is found including the cerebellar cortex. The question specifically asks about the cortex of the cerebellum which aligns with this information. There's no indication in the context that the cerebellar cortex has white matter instead; it clearly states it's part of the grey matter distribution.  I don't see any conflicting information here. The context is clear and direct. So based on this I can confidently say that the answer is True. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,52.46192519998294,0.018491978005029733,0.0054296254951648505,0.017079000012017787,4.225422779240439e-06,1.2406711301394563e-06
