3,<think>Alright let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a passage about the dukedom of Sussex and asked whether there was a Duke of Sussex before. They want only 'True' or 'False' as an answer.First I'll read the passage carefully. It mentions that the dukedom was conferred on Prince Augustus Frederick in 1801. He became Baron Arklow and Earl of Inverness at the same time. The title went extinct when he died in 1843 because his children from a marriage that was later annulled couldn't inherit.So the key point is that Prince Augustus Frederick was made Duke of Sussex. Therefore yes there has been a Duke of Sussex before.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,6.929655000014463,0.0021727241771522117,0.0006379565551623503,0.009412300016265363,2.240910003699052e-06,6.579773177939582e-07
1,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if anyone has climbed the North Face of Everest based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage again carefully.The passage says that The North Face is the northern side of Mount Everest. It mentions that George Mallory's body was found there which suggests he attempted a climb but didn't survive. Additionally it quotes an author or climber who noted that ""a simple slip would mean death "" indicating how dangerous it is.Now the question is whether anyone has climbed the North Face of Everest. The passage doesn't explicitly state that someone successfully climbed it. It only talks about Mallory's body being found and the danger involved. There's no mention of a successful ascent or any climbers reaching the summit via the North Face.I know from general knowledge that Mount Everest has been climbed many times but most expeditions take the more established routes like the Southeast Ridge. The North Face is considered one of the most challenging and dangerous routes. However I'm not sure if anyone has actually successfully summited via this route based on what's in the passage alone.Since the passage doesn't provide any information about a successful climb I can only go by what's written here. It talks about Mallory's attempt but doesn't confirm if he or anyone else succeeded. Therefore based solely on the given text there's no evidence that someone has climbed the North Face of Everest.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,9.28436929997406,0.003005293309273017,0.0008824159950892652,0.03277910000178963,8.780461216685095e-06,2.578124204368635e-06

I remember from the passage that it mentions two instances where the World Cup title was decided by penalties. One was in 1994 and another in 2006. So yes there have been cases where the World Cup was won on penalties.I need to make sure I'm only answering with 'True' or 'False'.

7,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if Salt Lake City is the biggest city in Utah based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage starts by saying that Salt Lake City is the capital and the most populous municipality of Utah. That already suggests it's the largest city in terms of population. The estimated population in 2014 was 190 884. Then it mentions the metropolitan area has a population of over a million which is much larger but that's the metro area not just the city itself.The passage also talks about the Salt Lake City--Ogden--Provo Combined Statistical Area which has a population of 2 423 912. But again this is a combined statistical area including other cities like Ogden and Provo so it's bigger than just Salt Lake City.The question is specifically about whether Salt Lake City is the biggest city in Utah. Since the passage states that it's the most populous municipality that means it has more residents than any other city in Utah. Even though the metro area is larger the actual city itself is still the largest within the state.I don't see any information suggesting there's a bigger city in Utah elsewhere. Reno is mentioned as another major urban area in the Great Basin but that's in Nevada not Utah. So putting it all together Salt Lake City is indeed the biggest city in Utah.</think>True,True,False,0,0.0,12.26933530002134,0.00405760887890118,0.0011913975136838635,0.020810999994864687,5.344759442798224e-06,1.5693314218872095e-06
16,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the days get longer or shorter at the equator based on the passage provided. Let me read the passage again carefully.The passage says that at the Equator the daytime length remains 12 hours all year round. It then contrasts this with other latitudes where the duration varies with the seasons—shorter in winter and longer in summer. It also mentions that northern and southern seasons happen at the same time but opposite in terms of summer and winter.So the question is asking if days get longer or shorter at the equator. From the passage it's clear that at the Equator the day length doesn't change; it stays exactly 12 hours every season. Therefore the answer should be False because the days don't vary in length there.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,14.677521300007356,0.004906057828187143,0.0014405195948985327,0.04397839997545816,1.1763452322347708e-05,3.4539918132718215e-06

Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage talks about the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final. It mentions that this was the final match of the 2017-18 season which was the 63rd season overall and the 26th since it was renamed from the European Cup to the UEFA Champions League. The game took place in Kiev Ukraine on May 26 2018. It was between Real Madrid and Liverpool.Now the question is whether the final is ""one game."" From what I know about sports tournaments especially football (soccer) leagues like the Champions League the final is typically a single match to determine the champion. In this case the passage explicitly states that it's the ""final match "" which implies it was one game played between two teams.I don't see any indication in the passage that the final involved multiple games or series. Usually if it were a series of matches the passage might mention something like a best-of-seven or multiple legs. Since it just refers to the final match it's safe to conclude that it was indeed one game.</think>True",True,False,0,0.0,17.260789299965836,0.005789970544288864,0.0017000545682551377,0.02570569998351857,6.646887219297544e-06,1.951662948093871e-06
6,"<think>Alright I need to determine if ""Pokémon Let's Go Eevee!"" is considered a spin-off. First I'll recall what a spin-off typically means—it's usually a game that diverges from the main series but still uses elements from it. The passage mentions these games are enhanced remakes of Pokémon Yellow (1998) which itself was based on the original Pokémon Red and Blue. They also integrate features from Pokémon Go like controller support with Poké Ball Plus.Since they're remakes of an existing game in the series rather than a new story or setting they might not be spin-offs but more of a continuation or reimagining. Spin-offs usually explore different settings or characters outside the main storyline which doesn't seem to be the case here. Therefore it's likely that ""Let's Go Eevee!"" isn't a spin-off.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,20.6995581999945,0.006996313098004074,0.0020542615808187914,0.018573699984699488,4.780875548991995e-06,1.4037635002029872e-06
8,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the Central Bank of India is a nationalized bank based on the passage provided. Let me read the passage again carefully.The passage says that in 1963 the revolutionary government in Burma nationalized the operations of the Central Bank of India there and it became People's Bank No. 1. Nationalizing means taking over private assets into public ownership. So in this case the Central Bank of India had its operations in Burma taken over by the Burmese government.Wait but does that mean the entire Central Bank of India was nationalized? Or just their branch in Burma? The passage specifically mentions ""operations there "" which refers to Burma. So it's about the bank's operations in that country not necessarily the whole bank.The question is asking if the Central Bank of India itself is a nationalized bank. From what I know the Central Bank of India is an Indian public sector bank meaning it's owned by the government of India. But was it always like that? Or did it become nationalized at some point?I think the Central Bank of India was established as a private bank in 1921 and later nationalized by the Indian government under the Banking Nationalization Act of 1956. So yes it's a nationalized bank.But wait the passage is about Burma nationalizing the Central Bank's operations there. That doesn't change the status of the Central Bank in India. The bank itself was already nationalized by its own government before this event.So putting it together: The question is whether the Central Bank of India is a nationalized bank. Based on general knowledge and the passage which only talks about their operations in Burma being nationalized I think the answer is True because the Central Bank of India was indeed nationalized by India.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,21.74496920002275,0.007359464357194912,0.002160890267861761,0.03800930001307279,1.0088252224118655e-05,2.9621185717844513e-06
10,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the dog from The Little Rascals is still alive. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.The passage talks about Pete the Pup who was a character in Hal Roach's Our Gang comedies later known as The Little Rascals during the 1930s. It mentions there were two versions of Pete: the original and a second one. The first Pete was active from 1924 to June 1930 and the second from September 9 1929 to January 28 1946.Wait that's a bit confusing because the dates overlap. The original Pete ran until 1930 but the second started in 1929 and went until 1946. So maybe they had two dogs playing Pete at different times?The passage also mentions that the original Pete was an APBT named ""Pal the Wonder Dog."" APBT stands for American Pit Bull Terrier right? It says he had a natural ring almost completely around his right eye and dye was used to finish it off. So this dog was real and had some unique markings.Now the question is whether this dog is still alive. Well the original Pete was active until 1930 so that's over 90 years ago. Even if he lived a long life for a dog which might be around 12-15 years adding 1930 to that would make him die by the late 1940s at the latest. The second Pete was active until 1946 so even if that one had a longer lifespan it's still been over 70 years since then.Dogs don't live that long especially considering they were working dogs in films back then which might have put more stress on them. So both versions of Pete the Pup from The Little Rascals are definitely not alive today.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,28.563057600025786,0.009749034960900096,0.0028625173987638815,0.029807899991283193,7.793641109148867e-06,2.2883735020066346e-06
12,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the statement ""does air force one fly with fighter escort"" is true or false based on the given passage. Let me read the passage carefully.The passage says that the Air Force usually doesn't have fighter aircraft escorting the presidential aircraft over the United States. However it mentions that this has happened in certain instances specifically during the attack on the World Trade Center.So the question is asking if Air Force One typically flies with a fighter escort. From the passage I understand that it's not usual but there have been exceptions. The example given is during the 9/11 attacks when they did provide an escort.Wait so does that mean that sometimes they do? So the answer isn't a straightforward ""False"" because it has happened before. But the question seems to be about whether Air Force One generally flies with fighter escorts. Since the passage says it's not usual but has occurred I think the statement is partially true but more often false.But the way the question is phrased is just asking if they fly with an escort without specifying frequency. So maybe the answer should consider that sometimes they do making the statement true in some cases. However since the passage says it's not usual perhaps the default assumption is that they don't typically have escorts.Wait but the question isn't about typicality; it's just asking if Air Force One flies with fighter escort. Since there are instances where they do like during 9/11 then technically yes they can fly with an escort. So the answer should be True because it has happened even though it's not the usual practice.I think I'm overcomplicating this.

It mentions that Bobby is declared the winner initially but then there's a recount because his margin was small. After the recount it says ""Leslie has won."" So that clearly indicates she becomes the winner after the recount.I need to make sure I'm not missing any details. The passage also talks about other characters' actions like Ben and Ron but the key point is the recount leading to Leslie's victory.

Then Daryl attacks Negan leading Negan to decide he needs to punish someone else. He then strikes Glenn with Lucille.Glenn survives the first two blows but ends up severely injured and brain damaged. He mutters something about Maggie before Negan kills him by bludgeoning his skull. So according to this passage Glenn dies in the seventh season premiere.Now the question is whether Glenn died in season 6.

Nonprofit organizations are those that don't distribute their surplus funds to owners or shareholders; instead they reinvest earnings into the organization's mission.The passage also states that JWU was founded in 1914 by Gertrude I. Johnson and Mary T. Wales as a business school. Over time it has expanded its programs but remains nonprofit. The number of students enrolled is provided along with various academic programs across campuses.Since the passage explicitly describes JWU as a nonprofit institution it cannot be for-profit.

The next sentence mentions King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands being around 890th in line to the British throne. This implies that he is part of the line of succession for the UK's throne but that doesn't mean the Netherlands is under the UK or part of it.I know from general knowledge that the United Kingdom includes countries like England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom.

It mentions that it's an essential oil with a specific odor and color derived from the leaves of the Melaleuca alternifolia plant. This plant is native to certain regions in Australia.So the key points here are:1. Tea tree oil has alternative names: melaleuca oil and ti tree oil.2. The source is the Melaleuca alternifolia plant.From this it seems that ""melaleuca"" refers to the type of oil or perhaps the plant itself while ""tea tree"" is another name for the same plant or its oil. Therefore they are referring to the same thing but by different names.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,42.105191999988165,0.014684745273837261,0.00431174357373459,0.018415899976389483,4.7039699997791715e-06,1.3811824474561137e-06
21,<think>Alright let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a passage about Black Mirror and is asking whether there will be new episodes. They want the answer to be just 'True' or 'False' without any explanations.First I'll read through the passage carefully. It mentions that the show premiered on Channel 4 in December 2011 and February 2013. Then Netflix added it to their catalogue in December 2014 and purchased the programme in September 2015. They commissioned a series of 12 episodes split into two parts: third and fourth series each with six episodes. The release dates were October 2016 and December 2017 respectively.Importantly the passage states that a fifth series was announced on March 5 2018. So based on this information there is confirmation of new episodes in the pipeline as of 2018.The user's question is straightforward: will there be new episodes? Since the fifth series has been announced the answer should be 'True'. I need to ensure that my response adheres strictly to their instructions—only one word without any punctuation or explanations.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,41.06249169999501,0.014323986288353052,0.004205817307509198,0.030874000018229708,8.117111673022413e-06,2.3833511198723624e-06
22,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if it's true or false that you can get a rash from using a hot tub based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage starts by talking about a condition caused by an infection of hair follicles due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It mentions that this bacterium is commonly found in places like hot tubs and water slides. Then it says children are more prone because they stay in the water longer. Next it describes how hot tub folliculitis appears on the skin as a rash that looks similar to chickenpox but then develops into pimples. It also mentions that this condition can be painful or itchy and if left alone without scratching it goes away quickly. However if the rash is aggravated it can last for months making treatment more difficult. The dots usually disappear after 7-10 days but there's a hyperpigmented lesion that takes a few months to fade.So putting this together the passage clearly states that using hot tubs can lead to an infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa which causes a rash called hot tub folliculitis. Therefore yes you can get a rash from using a hot tub.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,42.22001099999761,0.014735040380269368,0.004326511252567623,0.02070399999502115,5.323983326444351e-06,1.5632311263420378e-06
23,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if it's possible for twins to have two different fathers. The passage talks about something called superfecundation. From what I remember twins usually come from the same embryo or two separate embryos. But this term 'superfecundation' is new to me.The passage says that superfecundation is when two or more ova are fertilized by sperm from different acts of sexual intercourse. So if a woman has sex with two different men within the same cycle each man's sperm could fertilize an egg. That would result in twins who have different biological fathers. The passage also mentions heteropaternal superfecundation specifically refers to twins with two different fathers. It says these twins are half-siblings genetically because they share the same mother but different fathers. So yes it is possible.I think the answer should be 'True' because the passage explicitly states that heteropaternal superfecundation leads to twins from separate biological fathers.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,41.814265900000464,0.01459930975203243,0.004286657945401156,0.025564099982148036,6.628588885359932e-06,1.946290180484063e-06

Liquid nitrogen is a液态的氮气，常用于冷冻治疗，比如处理瘊子或疣。而干冰则是固态的二氧化碳，同样用于冷却，但它们在物理状态和化学成分上是不同的。从文章中提到，液体氮用于冻结和去除疣，效果比干冰更好，因为它更冷，作用时间更短，压力也更低。此外，干冰可以从压缩的二氧化碳气体中生成，而液态氮则是液化的氮气。因此，它们在物质组成、状态以及应用上都有所不同。所以，液体氮和干冰并不是同一物质。</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,39.849411100003636,0.013912220438382665,0.004084914375630882,0.022158499981742352,5.6945633272536924e-06,1.6720410448832195e-06
25,<think>Alright let's tackle this query. The user provided a passage about the origin of Thousand Island dressing and asked whether it's the same as French dressing.First I'll read the passage carefully. It mentions that Michael Bell found multiple origin stories in the Thousand Islands region. One story suggests that Thousand Island dressing was based on French dressing supported by a recipe from The Fannie Farmer Cookbook from 1965. However all claims were based on oral traditions without written records.The question is asking if Thousand Island and French dressings are the same. From the passage it seems that one origin story connects them but there's no concrete evidence since everything is oral. So while they might share similarities or have an influence from each other they aren't officially confirmed to be the same.I need to answer with just 'True' or 'False'. Since the passage doesn't definitively state they are the same and it's based on uncertain origins I think the answer is False.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,42.916816699987976,0.01497999975282462,0.004398436368103875,0.02263449999736622,5.85138112555824e-06,1.71808597936986e-06
26,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether breakfast lunch and dinner are always served in Italy based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage says that Italian meals are typical of the Mediterranean region and different from Northern Europe but they still often consist of breakfast lunch and supper. However it mentions that breakfast is much less emphasized sometimes skipped or with lighter portions compared to other Western countries. It also talks about merenda which are snacks in the late morning and mid-afternoon.So the passage states that Italian meals ""often"" include breakfast lunch and supper. The word ""often"" suggests that it's not always the case but is common. Additionally sometimes breakfast might be skipped or is lighter. Therefore while these three meals are part of their structure they aren't necessarily always served every day or in every situation.The question is asking if they're ""always"" served. Since the passage uses ""often "" it implies that there's variability. So the answer should be False because it's not a guaranteed daily occurrence.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,39.97892709998996,0.013951575192612179,0.004096469741793571,0.021239699999568984,5.191060000409683e-06,1.5242021009049731e-06

First I need to parse the passage carefully. It mentions that in 2016 during an interview with the Daily Mail Sirieix was living with his former partner and their two children but was in a new relationship. Then in 2018 he announced he was in a relationship referring to his partner as his 'fruitcake'.The question is specifically about Fred from ""First Dates."" I know that Fred Sirieix is the host of ""First Dates "" so it's safe to assume the user is asking about him. Looking at the passage there are two mentions of relationships: one in 2016 and another in 2018. In both cases he was in a relationship even though his living situation changed (living with a former partner but having a new one). The term 'fruitcake' is slang for someone considered crazy or eccentric which suggests he had a partner at that time.Therefore based on the information provided Fred Sirieix does have a partner. So the answer should be ""True.""</think>True",True,False,0,0.0,41.278926799976034,0.014406579561870796,0.0042300683932231815,0.030415299988817424,8.300567519046707e-06,2.4372175336513325e-06
28,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether alligators drown their prey and then eat them later based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage says that alligators have a heavy body and slow metabolism but can move quickly in short bursts. Their main prey are smaller animals they can kill with one bite. It also mentions that for larger prey they grab it and drag it into water to drown. Then when it comes to food that's too big to eat in one bite alligators let it rot or use a ""death roll"" by spinning or convulsing to tear off chunks.The question is asking if alligators drown their prey and then eat them later. From the passage I see that they do drown larger prey by dragging into water. But when it comes to eating for smaller prey they can kill and eat with a single bite. For bigger prey after drowning they might consume it over time or use methods like the death roll.Wait but does the passage explicitly say whether they eat it later? It mentions that if the food is too big they let it rot or tear it off. So maybe they don't always eat it immediately. They might have to process it over time which could mean eating it later. But I'm not entirely sure if ""later"" refers to a significant amount of time or just during the same encounter.I think the key point is that alligators do drown their prey and then may eat it later especially when the prey is too large for an immediate kill. So the answer should be True.</think>True",True,False,0,0.0,39.27819539999473,0.01370814047493912,0.004024992296323628,0.04476119999890216,1.1873543330067252e-05,3.4863167999303522e-06
29,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Scar is alive in The Lion King 2. Let me start by recalling what I know about these movies. The first movie The Lion King ends with Scar being defeated and presumably dead because Mufasa's spirit helps Simba take back the Pride Lands. In the second movie which is called The Lion King II: Simba's Pride the story continues several years later.In the passage provided it mentions that Scar makes a brief cameo in Simba's nightmare. During this nightmare Simba runs down a cliff where his father died trying to rescue him. Then Scar appears and turns into Kovu throwing Simba off the cliff. Later Scar is seen again as a reflection in a pool of water after Kovu is exiled from Pride Rock.So based on the passage Scar does appear in these scenes but they are part of a nightmare and a reflection. Now I need to determine if Scar is alive in The Lion King 2. Since the first movie established that Scar was killed by his own hyenas when he tried to take over Pride Rock it's generally accepted that he dies in the first film.However in the second movie there are references and cameos of Scar but these are more symbolic or part of Simba's memories rather than actual appearances. The passage specifically mentions these cameos as part of a nightmare and a reflection which suggests they aren't real events but rather figments of Simba's imagination or visions.Therefore even though Scar appears in the movie through these means he isn't actually alive in The Lion King 2. His presence is more about the lingering effects of his past actions on Simba rather than him being a living character again.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,39.84005819997401,0.013899797676959546,0.004081266797090341,0.03624139999737963,8.634612334536445e-06,2.535299969517165e-06

Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage starts by saying that cultivated cowpeas have several common names including black-eyed pea southern pea yardlong bean catjang and crowder pea. That immediately tells me that ""black-eyed pea"" is one of the alternative names for cowpeas. So it seems like they are referring to the same plant or product.The passage also mentions that cowpeas were domesticated in Africa and have a long history of farming. It talks about their spread into other regions after a second domestication in Asia. The seeds are used in various ways—cooked into stews curries ground into flour etc.Given this information the key point is that ""black-eyed pea"" is listed as a common name for cowpeas. Therefore when someone refers to black-eyed peas they're talking about a type of cowpea.

31,<think>Alright let's tackle this question step by step. The user has provided a passage about the Isle of Man and its relationship with the European Union and the European Economic Area (EEA). They want me to determine whether the Isle of Man is part of the EEA based on the passage.First I'll read the passage carefully. It states that the Isle of Man holds neither membership nor associate membership of the EU and lies outside the EEA. That seems straightforward—so it's explicitly mentioned that the Isle isn't part of the EEA.However there are some nuances to consider. The passage mentions Protocol 3 which allows trade in Manx goods without non-EU tariffs. It also talks about a Customs and Excise agreement with the UK facilitating free trade within the UK. Additionally while goods can move freely within the EEA people capital and services cannot.I need to ensure I'm not misinterpreting any indirect references. The passage clearly says the Isle is outside the EEA so even though there are agreements about trade these don't imply membership in the EEA. Membership would typically involve more comprehensive participation beyond just trade aspects.So putting it all together the answer should be False because the Isle of Man isn't part of the EEA despite having certain trade agreements.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,39.63307700000587,0.013830075536596008,0.004060794941089194,0.03538210000260733,9.348067779016369e-06,2.7447851781821716e-06

It mentions that after a 5-15 start the Heat improved and finished with a record of 42-40 which qualified them for the NBA playoffs. That directly answers the question—yes they made the playoffs.Additionally the passage talks about Wade's performance in the playoffs including specific details like his game-winning shot and their series against the New Orleans Hornets and Indiana Pacers. This further confirms that he did participate in the playoffs during his rookie year.I should also consider if there's any conflicting information or if I'm misinterpreting something. The passage doesn't mention any issues preventing Wade from playing in the playoffs so it seems clear-cut.Therefore based on the information given the answer is definitely true.</think>True,True,False,0,0.0,39.700346099969465,0.013852689968667432,0.004067435003980264,0.03878289999556728,1.0220665554354329e-05,3.000997851954033e-06

The Jungle Book is an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's story and it was released in 2016. It's a Disney film so I remember that it's a mix of live-action and CGI animation.In the original stories King Louie is a character who is a king of the apes. He plays a significant role in Mowgli's journey. Now about his fate: from what I've heard in some versions he doesn't die but in others he might meet a different end. But specifically for the 2016 movie I think he survives.Wait let me think more carefully. The passage provided mentions that during the credits Louie is shown emerging from the rubble and performing ""I Wan'na Be like You"" with modified lyrics. So if he's still alive after the credits that suggests he didn't die in the movie itself.In the 2016 version directed by Jon Favreau I believe King Louie doesn't die. He helps Mowgli but isn't killed. The ending focuses more on Mowgli leaving the jungle and the other animals continuing their lives.

In their first three attempts (1995 2007 2011) they reached the quarterfinals. Then in 2015 they finished third. So they made it to the finals? Wait no the passage doesn't mention them winning any of those tournaments.Looking at the years: 1995 2007 2011 and 2015. Each time they either reached the quarterfinals or finished third but didn't win. The passage also mentions that England reached the finals in the UEFA Women's Championship in 1984 and 2009 but that's a different tournament.So based on this information England hasn't won the FIFA Women's World Cup yet.

35,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the statement ""does the dorsal root ganglion carry sensory input"" is true or false based on the given passage. Let me read the passage carefully.The passage says that a dorsal root ganglion is a cluster of neurons in the dorsal root of a spinal nerve. It also mentions that these ganglia contain the cell bodies of sensory neurons known as first-order neurons. Now I know that sensory input refers to information coming into the nervous system from the body's environment. Sensory neurons are responsible for transmitting this information. The passage specifies that the dorsal root ganglion houses the cell bodies of these sensory neurons. So do they carry the sensory input themselves?Wait the ganglion is where the cell bodies are located but the actual transmission happens through the axons of these neurons. The ganglion isn't a pathway for the signals; it's more like the processing hub. However since the sensory neurons' cell bodies are there and their axons likely carry the input towards the central nervous system I think the ganglion is involved in carrying or transmitting the sensory input.But wait does the ganglion itself carry the input or do the neurons within it carry it? The question is about whether the ganglion carries the input. Since the ganglion is a cluster of neurons and those neurons are responsible for sending the signals I think the answer would be true because the ganglion contains the sensory neurons that carry the input.Alternatively maybe the ganglion doesn't carry the input but rather processes it. But in reality the ganglion's role includes both processing and transmitting. The cell bodies are there and their axons extend to carry the signals. So yes the ganglion is involved in carrying sensory input because it contains those neurons.I think the answer should be True.</think>True",True,False,0,0.0,44.61467709997669,0.015573961648233013,0.004572835810369525,0.03832510000211187,1.025553177830621e-05,3.011235293207628e-06

The passage talks about the DeCavalcante crime family operating in Elizabeth New Jersey and mentions their various illicit activities. It also notes that they are part of the American Mafia or Cosa Nostra.

Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage starts by saying that the four-leaf clover is a rare variation of the common three-leaf clover. It mentions traditional superstition associating them with good luck but it's unclear when or how this belief began. Then there are some historical references: the earliest mention in 1640 refers to it as ""Fower-leafed or purple grasse"" and says it was kept in gardens because it was ""good for the purples in children or others."" That doesn't directly talk about luck but more about its use.Next a description from 1869 talks about four-leaf clovers being gathered at night during the full moon by sorceresses who mixed them with vervain and other ingredients. It also mentions young girls seeking the plant for perfect happiness. Still this is more about magical practices rather than luck.The first reference to luck comes from an 1877 letter in St. Nicholas Magazine where an 11-year-old girl asks if fairies whispered that a four-leaf clover brings good luck to the finder. So this directly connects finding one with bringing good luck.Putting it all together the passage does mention that four-leaf clovers are associated with good luck according to traditional superstition and there's an explicit reference in 1877 linking them to luck.

It mentions that it's based on real-life forced adoptions in Australia. Specifically it references Julia Gillard who was the former Prime Minister offering a national apology in 2013 to those affected by these practices.So the key point here is that ""Love Child"" is based on real events—forced adoptions.

It mentions that it's a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film tape used in plumbing for sealing pipe threads. Then it refers to the genericized trademark Teflon tape. It clarifies that while Teflon is identical to PTFE Chemours who own the trademark considers this usage incorrect because they don't make Teflon in tape form anymore.So from this I understand that thread seal tape and Teflon tape are essentially the same product since both refer to PTFE tape.

The passage says he was mentioned in passing in later seasons before his official return in season 10. So yes definitely after season 3.</think>True,True,False,0,0.0,37.85712070000591,0.013226942538350994,0.0038837026741961873,0.00830869999481365,2.01026000334726e-06,5.90253728568985e-07
42,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether someone has to be Mormon to attend BYU based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage says that students come from every state in the U.S. and many foreign countries. It mentions there were 2 396 foreign students in the 2005-06 academic year which made up eight percent of enrollment. Then it states that slightly more than 98% of these students are active members of the LDS Church. Also in 2006 about 12.6% of the student body reported themselves as ethnic minorities mostly Asians Pacific Islanders and Hispanics.So from this I can gather a few points. First BYU attracts students from various backgrounds including foreign countries. Second while most students are LDS members (over 98%) it's not 100% which means there are some non-Mormons attending. The passage doesn't specify the exact percentage of non-LDS students but since it says ""slightly more than 98%"" that implies a small number of exceptions.Additionally the mention of ethnic minorities includes groups like Asians and Hispanics who may or may not be Mormon. This further suggests that BYU's student body is diverse in terms of both religion and ethnicity.Therefore putting this together it seems that while most students at BYU are Mormons it's not a requirement to be Mormon to attend. There are non-Mormon students there as well.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,43.51187310004025,0.015200025671961109,0.004463040508332444,0.054726700007449836,1.4565199445900767e-05,4.27664245718405e-06
43,<think>Alright let's tackle this question. The user is asking if a dog can be mixed with three breeds based on the provided passage. First I'll read through the passage carefully to find relevant information.The passage mentions that designer dogs are typically created by crossing two purebred breeds and using a portmanteau name. Examples given include Schnoodle (Schnauzer and Poodle) and Shepsky (German Shepherd and Siberian Husky). It also notes that other breeds are being crossed creating labels like Puggle.However the passage then mentions complex crosses with multiple breeds in recent ancestry such as German Chusky which is a mix of German Shepherd Dog Husky and Chow Chow. This indicates that some designer dogs can indeed have three or more breeds in their lineage.So based on this information the answer should be 'True' because the passage explicitly provides an example of a dog mixed with three breeds.</think>The passage states that there are complex crosses involving multiple breeds such as German Chusky which includes three breeds.

44,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the right atrium receives blood from the lungs. Let me read the passage carefully.The passage says that the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from several sources: the superior vena cava inferior vena cava anterior cardiac veins smallest cardiac veins and the coronary sinus. It then sends this blood down to the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve which in turn sends it to the pulmonary artery for pulmonary circulation.Wait so the right atrium gets blood from the superior and inferior vena cava which are bringing deoxygenated blood from the upper and lower parts of the body. The pulmonary artery is where this deoxygenated blood goes after leaving the right ventricle. So the lungs receive deoxygenated blood via the pulmonary artery to oxygenate it.But does the right atrium get blood directly from the lungs? From the passage it seems that the right atrium doesn't receive blood from the lungs. Instead the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins which come from the lungs. So the right atrium is getting deoxygenated blood from the body via the vena cavae not from the lungs.Therefore the answer should be False because the right atrium doesn't receive blood directly from the lungs; it's the left atrium that does.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,42.048197700001765,0.014696278234127738,0.004315129888341436,0.024414699990302324,6.3285883346300884e-06,1.8582038417287822e-06
45,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether a certification of birth is the same as a birth certificate based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage again carefully.The passage says that the actual record of birth is stored with a government agency. This agency issues certified copies or representations of the original birth record upon request. These can be used for things like applying for passports which are government benefits. The certification is signed and/or sealed by the registrar or another custodian of birth records who is commissioned by the government.So from this I understand that a birth certificate is the actual official document stored by the government. When someone requests a copy they get what's called a certified copy or representation of that original record. This certified copy is then used for various purposes like getting a passport.The question is asking if a certification of birth (which I think refers to this certified copy) is the same as a birth certificate. The passage distinguishes between the actual birth record (birth certificate) and its certified copies or representations. So while they serve similar purposes and are issued by the government through authorized officials they aren't exactly the same thing.Therefore the answer should be False because a certification of birth is a copy or representation not the original document itself.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,43.41956979999668,0.015171729655572874,0.004454732215301197,0.017677999974694103,4.53512721465409e-06,1.331606729242495e-06

Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage starts by talking about ""dry water "" which is described as an unusual form of ""powdered liquid."" It explains that it's a water-air emulsion where tiny water droplets each the size of a grain of sand are coated with sandy silica. This coating prevents the water droplets from combining into bulk liquid resulting in a white powder similar to table salt. The passage also mentions that researchers commonly refer to it as ""empty water.""So the key points here are that dry water exists and is made up mostly of liquid water (95%) but with a silica coating that keeps it in a powdered form. It's not just theoretical; it's something that researchers use and study.The question is asking if such a thing as dry water exists.

47,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether every country has its own sign language based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage starts by mentioning that there are perhaps three hundred sign languages in use around the world today. It's noted that the exact number isn't known with confidence because new sign languages emerge frequently through creolization de novo or sometimes through language planning. Next it talks about specific countries like Sri Lanka and Tanzania where each school for the deaf might have a separate sign language. These are known only to the students of that particular school and sometimes even denied by the schools themselves. On the other hand some countries share sign languages under different names such as Croatian and Serbian or Indian and Pakistani.It also mentions that deaf sign languages can arise outside educational institutions especially in village communities with high levels of congenital deafness. Additionally there are significant sign languages developed for hearing individuals like the speech-taboo languages used in aboriginal Australia. Finally scholars are working on field surveys to identify all the world's sign languages.So the question is: Does every country have its own sign language?From the passage it seems that some countries have their own unique sign languages especially within schools or specific communities. However other countries share sign languages with neighboring regions under different names. For example Croatian and Serbian are mentioned as shared between two countries. This suggests that not every country has a completely distinct sign language; sometimes they share them.Moreover the passage doesn't state that every single country has its own unique sign language. Instead it highlights variation and sharing among countries. Therefore the answer should be False because not every country necessarily has an exclusive sign language—some share with others.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,44.08686779998243,0.015404865804948494,0.004523185789069786,0.022100600006524473,5.716516671074917e-06,1.6784869986521143e-06

They want the answer to be just 'True' or 'False' without any explanations.First I'll read the passage carefully. It mentions that in Topeka I-70 intersects with I-470 twice. The second time the Kansas Turnpike merges making I-70 a toll road. It also states that this is one of only two tolled sections on I-70 with the other being on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Additionally it notes that from Topeka to Bonner Springs I-70 carries the turnpike designation and beyond that point the highway is free.So focusing on Kansas specifically the passage clearly indicates that there are tolls on I-70 in that state because of the merge with the Kansas Turnpike.

51,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if ""The Mountain Between Us"" is based on a true story.

It's based on a 2011 novel of the same name by Charles Martin. The movie stars Idris Elba and Kate Winslet as characters who survive a plane crash with a dog get stranded in High Uintas Wilderness with injuries and harsh weather.Now the question is whether the movie is a true story. From the passage it's clear that the film is based on a novel. Novels are typically works of fiction unless specified otherwise. The fact that it's adapted from a 2011 book suggests that the story isn't real but comes from an author's creation.I should also consider if any part of the plot could be based on actual events. Plane crashes and survival stories do happen in real life like the Andes flight disaster or the story of the Uruguayan survivors. However unless the passage explicitly states that it's a true story or based on real events I can't assume that.The passage doesn't mention any connection to real-life incidents; instead it focuses on the adaptation from a novel.

It mentions that before the 1999-2000 season away goals were used as a tie-breaker after extra time. However this was changed because Ipswich Town's chairman David Sheepshanks pushed for it after his club lost twice on away goals in 1997 and 1999. Since then away goals have not been part of the playoff system.The question is straightforward: does the away goal count in the playoffs?

I remember that Maya Angelou wrote several volumes of her life story. The first one is titled ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."" From the passage provided it clearly states that it's a 1969 autobiography describing her early years. It mentions it's the first in a seven-volume series and talks about her experiences from age three up to becoming a mother at 16. The question is straightforward: Is this book an autobiography? Well since the passage explicitly calls it an autobiography that should be the answer. I don't think there's any ambiguity here because autobiographies are first-person accounts of someone's life and Maya Angelou is known for her autobiographical works. The passage also refers to it as a coming-of-age story based on her experiences which aligns with what an autobiography entails.I should make sure that ""autobiography"" isn't being confused with other forms like memoir or biography. A memoir is more about specific events rather than the full life and a biography is someone else writing about another person's life.

Let me read through the passage again carefully.The passage starts by talking about the most common use of transmissions in motor vehicles. It mentions that the transmission adapts the output of the internal combustion engine to the drive wheels. So right there it's clear that the transmission is separate from the engine because it's adapting the engine's output. It goes on to explain that engines need to operate at a high rotational speed which isn't suitable for starting stopping or slower travel. The transmission then reduces this higher engine speed to a slower wheel speed while increasing torque. This shows that the transmission is modifying the engine's output but isn't the engine itself.Additionally the passage mentions that transmissions are used on pedal bicycles and fixed machines adapting different rotational speeds and torques. If the transmission were the same as the engine it wouldn't make sense to talk about using transmissions in these other contexts where they serve a distinct purpose of adjusting speed and torque.So putting this all together the transmission is a component that works with the engine but isn't the engine itself. They are separate parts serving different functions within the vehicle or machine.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,41.46973309997702,0.014494790423430907,0.004255968918453471,0.017733599990606308,4.508873885626801e-06,1.3238982112796927e-06
55,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Guernsey money is legal tender in the UK. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.The passage says that the pound is the currency of Guernsey. Since 1921 Guernsey has been in a currency union with the United Kingdom. It mentions that the Guernsey pound isn't a separate currency but is a local issue of banknotes and coins denominated in pound sterling. It's similar to how Scotland England and Northern Ireland have their own banknotes.It also states that these Guernsey pounds can be exchanged at par with other sterling coinage and notes. The passage refers to the ""sterling zone "" which I think includes places where the pound is used but aren't part of the UK itself.So legal tender means money that must be accepted if offered to settle a debt or pay for goods or services. In the UK all banknotes and coins are considered legal tender but this can vary based on their origin.Since Guernsey is part of the currency union with the UK their notes and coins are denominated in pound sterling. The passage says they can be exchanged at par which suggests that they're accepted as equivalent to regular UK pounds. However I remember reading somewhere that while these local issues (like Scottish or Northern Irish banknotes) are widely accepted in the UK technically only Bank of England notes and coins are legal tender throughout the entire UK.Wait but the passage says Guernsey money can be exchanged at par with other sterling coinage. So if someone offers a Guernsey £10 note in payment within the UK would it have to be accepted? Or is it only that they can exchange them for Bank of England notes?I think the key here is whether they're considered legal tender. In the UK only Bank of England and Northern Irish (if applicable) banknotes are legal tender everywhere. Other regions like Scotland or Guernsey might not have their money recognized as legal tender in all parts of the UK.But wait the passage says it's a currency union since 1921 so maybe they're treated similarly to how Scottish notes are accepted even though they aren't legal tender everywhere. So perhaps in practice you can use Guernsey money in the UK but legally it might not be required to accept it.Hmm I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down:1. The Guernsey pound is part of the same currency union as the UK.2. It's denominated in pound sterling similar to other regions.3. They can be exchanged at par with other sterling notes and coins.So if someone has Guernsey money they can exchange it for UK pounds without losing value. But does that mean it's legal tender? Or is it just that the exchange rate is 1:1?I think in terms of legal tender only the main currency (Bank of England) is recognized everywhere. So while you might be able to use Guernsey money in some places in the UK it's not necessarily required by law to accept it.Therefore the answer would be False because Guernsey money isn't considered legal tender throughout the entire UK.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,48.620791999972425,0.01700145018929571,0.004991975838250886,0.01830969998263754,4.696494441143133e-06,1.3789874695175829e-06

In ""Raiders "" Indiana Jones retrieves the Ark of the Covenant and in ""Temple of Doom "" he's dealing with a mystical stone and fighting a Thuggee cult. The passage also mentions that Harrison Ford plays the same role again.So if ""Temple of Doom"" is set before ""Raiders "" it would make sense as a prequel because it shows earlier adventures of Indiana Jones.

It also mentions that a dollar in the mid-70 cent US range has been the usual rate for much of the 2010s.Hmm so I'm trying to understand what this means regarding the value relative to USD. The Canadian dollar is often abbreviated as CAD and the US dollar as USD. So when they say a Canadian dollar is worth mid-70 cents US that means 1 CAD = approximately 0.70 USD.Wait but does that mean the Canadian dollar is weaker or stronger than the USD? If 1 CAD is only about 0.70 USD then it's actually worth less than the USD. Because you need more CAD to make one USD. For example if I have $1 USD it can buy me approximately $1.43 CAD (since 1 / 0.70 ≈ 1.4286). So that means the Canadian dollar is weaker against the USD.The question is asking whether the Canadian dollar is worth more than USD. Based on this since 1 CAD = ~0.70 USD it's actually worth less.

I need to determine whether the statement is true or false based on the passage.First I'll read through the passage carefully. It mentions that a golden match is when an opponent doesn't lose a single point throughout the entire match. The passage states this has happened only three times in competitive tennis history and never in a best-of-5 set match. The examples given are Hazel Wightman in 1910 Benjamin Tullou in 2016 and Joffrey de Schepper also in 2016. Both Tullou and de Schepper played against the same opponent Tomas Fabian who didn't win a single game across five matches over two seasons.The key point here is that these are considered golden matches because the opponents didn't lose any points. Even though de Schepper gave Fabian an ""honor point"" by hitting a ball out deliberately in the last game it's still credited as a golden match. So the question is asking if there has ever been a perfect tennis match. Since the passage explicitly mentions three instances where opponents didn't lose any points these are indeed perfect matches.

60,<think>Alright let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether chewing tobacco is banned in Major League Baseball (MLB). I need to determine if that's true based on the provided passage.First I'll read through the passage carefully. It mentions that MLB has taken actions to lower tobacco usage among players. Specifically it states there's a complete ban on tobacco with fines for players and managers if it's discovered. Additionally tobacco companies are no longer allowed to leave free products in stadium clubhouses starting from December 5 2016.However the passage also notes that this ban applies only to players entering MLB for the first time after that date. Players who had prior experience before the ban are grandfathered in meaning they can still use tobacco without facing penalties. This suggests that while new players are banned existing ones aren't necessarily prohibited from using chewing tobacco.So is it accurate to say that chewing tobacco is completely banned? The answer seems a bit nuanced. On one hand there's a prohibition for rookies but on the other veteran players can still use it without facing consequences. Therefore while there are restrictions in place it's not an outright ban across all MLB players.I should also consider the context of the question. If someone is asking if it's banned they might be looking for whether it's entirely prohibited or just restricted. Given that some players can still use it the correct answer would be False because it's not completely banned.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,47.69271379997372,0.016683803019033393,0.0048987080886540545,0.04162720000022091,9.053701109789675e-06,2.658353063038768e-06
61,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Guitar Center and Musician's Friend are the same company. Let me read the passage again carefully.The passage says that in 2000 Guitar Center bought Musician's Friend for $50 million. It mentions that after the purchase Musician's Friend became a wholly owned subsidiary of Guitar Center. A subsidiary means it's under the parent company but operates somewhat independently. The headquarters were in Medford Oregon until 2011 when they moved to Guitar Center's facilities in California.So from this I understand that Musician's Friend was acquired by Guitar Center and became a part of their business structure as a subsidiary. They didn't merge into one company but rather one owns the other. So they are not exactly the same company; instead one is owned by the other.Therefore the answer should be False because they aren't the same company but have a parent-subsidiary relationship.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,46.675163699983386,0.016325060907301677,0.004793374018090159,0.0367938999843318,9.961892478298118e-06,2.9250167486434585e-06
62,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if there's still a water crisis in Cape Town based on the passage provided. Let me read through it carefully.The passage starts by talking about a drought beginning in 2015 that caused severe water shortages especially affecting Cape Town. They mentioned ""Day Zero "" which was when the city might run out of water if certain conditions were met. But then through water-saving measures and increased supply they managed to reduce daily usage significantly. By March 2018 their consumption dropped by more than half to around 500 million liters a day.Then good rains in the winter of 2018 helped increase dam levels to 43% by June 2018. Because of this improvement Cape Town announced that ""Day Zero"" was unlikely for 2019. However water restrictions would stay until the dams reached 85%. As of July 16 2018 the dam levels were at 55.1%.So the question is whether there's still a water crisis in Cape Town. From the passage it seems that while things have improved—dam levels are up and ""Day Zero"" was delayed—the city isn't out of the woods yet. Water restrictions are still in place until dam levels reach 85% which suggests that the crisis hasn't completely ended but is under control.I think the key here is whether a water crisis implies an ongoing severe shortage or if it's just a situation where they're managing the resources carefully. Since they've reduced usage and increased dam levels maybe the immediate danger has passed but there are still restrictions in place. So technically there might not be an active crisis anymore but they're being cautious.Wait but the passage says that water restrictions will remain until 85% is reached. As of July 16 it's at 55.1% so they're below 85%. That means restrictions are still in effect indicating that there's still a need for conservation efforts. So even though things have improved the crisis isn't over yet because they're not back to normal levels.Therefore I think the answer is True—there is still a water crisis in Cape Town.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,49.1847543999902,0.01721267249719205,0.005053995056951536,0.034824500005925074,9.133800552485304e-06,2.681871908674989e-06

They want only 'True' or 'False' as an answer.First I'll read the passage carefully. It mentions that there was little fighting in Florida but specifically notes the Battle of Olustee near Lake City in February 1864. That's a clear indication that at least one battle occurred there.I should consider if there are any other battles mentioned or implied. The passage doesn't list others beyond Olustee so it seems like that was the major conflict. However even if there were smaller skirmishes not mentioned the presence of Olustee is enough to answer the question affirmatively.The user's instruction is strict: only 'True' or 'False' no explanations.

64,"<think>Alright let's break this down. The question is whether Beckett finds out who killed her mom based on the passage provided.First I'll read through the passage carefully. It mentions that in season six's penultimate episode ""Veritas "" Senator Bracken realizes Beckett was bluffing and tries to frame her for murder. Beckett had discovered that Bracken was using drug money from Vulcan Simmons to prepare for a presidential run.Then Bracken captures Beckett and berates her about her mother's death making her the good cop she is today. He leaves his thugs to kill her but she escapes by killing them. Mr. Smith returns having faked his death in season five to avoid Bracken's attention. Smith reveals there might be a tape recording of Bracken admitting to murder.Beckett remembers Captain Montgomery advising her to search her mother's appointment book and tape recordings for clues. Castle helps her find the tape which reveals that when Bracken was an Assistant D.A. he was blackmailing Montgomery and his friends regarding their mobster extortion scheme and the killing of FBI agent Arman. Bracken admits he wrongly convicted Pulgatti for the killing and threatens to have Johanna Beckett killed if she continues investigating showing he's had other people killed.Montgomery helps from beyond the grave allowing Beckett to arrest Bracken during a live interview in his Senate Office for conspiracy fraud and her mother's murder. So Beckett arrests Bracken for her mom's murder.From this it's clear that Beckett does find out who killed her mom—it was Senator Bracken.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,50.83262050000485,0.017785365660645897,0.005222149561588619,0.02574160002404824,6.722014470327487e-06,1.9737218558787967e-06

The question is whether they were in the World Cup in 2018.First I need to parse the passage carefully. It mentions two periods when they failed to qualify: 1966-2002 and then 2010-2018. So from 2010 up until 2018 including the 2018 World Cup they didn't qualify.The user is asking specifically about 2018. Since the passage includes 2010 to 2018 as a period of failure that means in 2018 Trinidad and Tobago were not in the World Cup.I should make sure there's no ambiguity here. The passage clearly states they didn't qualify during those years so the answer is straightforward.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,45.984898599999724,0.016096534240771967,0.004726273883395144,0.0238124999741558,6.128512772395171e-06,1.7994575370676653e-06
66,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the answer is True or False based on the passage provided. The question is asking if you can get the death penalty as a minor.First let me read the passage again carefully. It says that capital punishment for juveniles existed in the United States until March 1 2005. Then the U.S. Supreme Court banned it in Roper v. Simmons. So before 2005 minors could receive the death penalty but after that date it was prohibited.The question is whether you can get the death penalty as a minor. Based on the passage prior to March 1 2005 yes minors could be sentenced to death. However after that date it's no longer allowed. So if someone asks this question today the answer would depend on when they're asking and where.But since the passage doesn't specify a time frame beyond stating the ban happened in 2005 I think the general statement is that you cannot get the death penalty as a minor now because it was banned. However if someone were to be tried before March 1 2005 then yes they could.Wait but the question doesn't specify a time frame. It's just asking in general. So I think the answer is False because after 2005 minors can't get the death penalty anymore. But if someone were tried before that date it was possible. Since the passage mentions that it existed until March 1 2005 and then it was banned the current situation is that you cannot get the death penalty as a minor.So I think the answer should be False because now it's not allowed anymore.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,50.48526590000256,0.017663688904615723,0.005186422760673611,0.0253742000204511,6.648753335401933e-06,1.9522108782057587e-06

It also mentions that these properties remain constant regardless of the sample size. Examples given include freezing/melting point boiling/condensing point density viscosity and solubility.Looking at the question: ""Is boiling point a characteristic property of matter?"" From the passage I see that boiling/condensing point is listed as one of the examples.

68,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether North and South Korea speak the same language. From what I know both countries do speak Korean but there might be some differences because they've been separated for a long time.I remember reading that after the division in 1953 the two countries developed differently. In the South they adopted more modern terms influenced by other languages especially English due to globalization and their integration with other countries. On the other hand North Korea has been more isolated so their language might have retained older terms or expressions that aren't used much in the South anymore.Also I think about how technology and culture influence language. The South has a lot of advancements in tech which introduces new words into Korean. In contrast North Korea's limited access to outside information means they don't adopt as many new terms from other languages. This could lead to differences in vocabulary and maybe even grammar or pronunciation over time.However the core language structure is probably still similar because both countries share a common historical background before the division. They use the same Hangul alphabet which was created together. So while there are certainly differences due to separation it's not like they're speaking entirely different languages. It's more about variations within the same language family.I also wonder if there have been any efforts to standardize Korean between the two countries. I don't think so because of the political tensions which might mean that maintaining linguistic differences serves a symbolic purpose as well.So putting it all together while North and South Korea do speak Korean there are noticeable differences due to their separation and different experiences over the decades. Therefore they don't speak exactly the same language anymore.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,49.72850379999727,0.01740271965145898,0.005109796814546671,0.04597980002290569,1.2326798428978235e-05,3.619401829568131e-06
69,"<think>Alright let's tackle this question step by step. The passage talks about wisdom teeth and mentions that most adults have four one in each quadrant. It also states that having none fewer or more is possible with the extras being supernumerary teeth. So the key point here is whether having six wisdom teeth is rare.First I need to understand what's considered normal. The passage says ""most adults have four "" so anything beyond four would be extra. Supernumerary teeth are mentioned as possible but not specified on how common they are. Now considering that supernumerary teeth can occur it's possible for someone to have more than four. However the question is about having six being rare. Since the passage doesn't provide specific statistics or mention that six is particularly uncommon I can infer that while having extra wisdom teeth isn't typical it's not necessarily rare either.Therefore the statement ""it is rare to have 6 wisdom teeth"" might be true because the passage implies that most people have four and extras are possible but doesn't explicitly say how common six is. However without specific data it's a bit of a judgment call.

But then Aslan reappears alive because of a Deeper Magic from before time. The Witch didn't know about this magic because she entered Narnia at the Dawn of Time.So the key points are: Aslan was dead his body was gone after the Stone Table broke but he came back to life due to this ancient magic.

71,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether cows have to keep getting pregnant to produce milk. Let me read through the passage again carefully.The passage says that to maintain lactation a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves. So it seems like producing milk is tied to breeding because they mention that depending on market conditions the cow may be bred with either a dairy bull or a beef bull. It also talks about female calves being kept as replacement cows if they have dairy breeding.Wait but then there's more. If a heifer isn't a good producer she goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef. For male calves they can be used later as breeding bulls or sold for veal or beef. The passage also mentions that dairy farmers usually start breeding or inseminating heifers around 13 months old with a gestation period of about nine months. Newborn calves are removed quickly within three days.So putting this together: the cows need to be bred and have calves to keep producing milk. Without being pregnant they might stop lactating.

Let me read the passage carefully.The passage says ""A table may have multiple foreign keys and each foreign key can have a different parent table."" That clearly states that having multiple foreign keys in a single table is possible. Each of these foreign keys can reference different tables which means they can have different parent tables. Additionally the passage mentions that each foreign key is enforced independently by the database system. This implies that each foreign key operates on its own without affecting others. Furthermore it talks about establishing cascading relationships using foreign keys which would require multiple foreign keys pointing to different tables.So putting this together the statement in question is asking if having multiple foreign keys in a table is possible.

Initially it used Microsoft Silverlight instead of Adobe Flash which was used by BBC iPlayer and Channel 4's 4oD. Then on September 15 2009 ITV switched to using Flash for its player.Moving further in November 2009 the website underwent a revamp to improve navigation and visual appeal. The passage states that the service is free to use funded by pre- mid- and post-roll adverts. It also mentions that users could previously use ad-blocking software to skip these ads. However during Summer 2010 ITV upgraded its website to detect ad-blocking software.The key point here is that the service is described as ""free to use."" This suggests that there's no subscription or payment required to access it. The funding comes from advertisements which are part of the free experience.

77,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the internal intercostal muscles contract during inspiration based on the given passage. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.The passage says that the internal intercostal muscles have fibres angled obliquely downward and backward from rib to rib. These muscles can assist in lowering the rib cage adding force to exhalation. Hmm so the muscles are involved in lowering the rib cage which is part of exhaling. That makes sense because when you exhale your ribcage moves down and inward decreasing the volume of the thoracic cavity which helps push air out.Now the question is about whether these muscles contract during inspiration. Inspiration is the process of inhaling where the rib cage expands and the diaphragm contracts to increase thoracic volume allowing more air into the lungs.If the internal intercostal muscles are involved in lowering the rib cage (exhalation) then their contraction would be associated with exhaling. During inhalation other muscles like the external intercostals or the diaphragm are likely active. The internal intercostals probably relax during inspiration because they're not needed for expanding the chest; instead they help in compressing it.So based on this reasoning the answer should be False because the internal intercostal muscles don't contract during inspiration—they assist in exhalation by helping to lower the rib cage.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,43.55427319998853,0.015250150141278224,0.00447775808459507,0.0180294000019785,4.6144261554426665e-06,1.3548905310363386e-06

For example it gives 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ as a valid run and mentions that Q♠ K♠ A♠ isn't allowed because aces are low.So from this I understand that runs require not only consecutive ranks but also all cards must be in the same suit. The passage explicitly states ""of the same suit"" when describing runs. Therefore if someone has cards of different suits they can't form a run with them; each card in the run must belong to the same suit.I don't see any exceptions mentioned regarding runs not needing the same suit.

Let me start by reading the passage carefully.The passage says that the cougar also commonly known as the puma mountain lion panther or catamount. So right there it lists several names for the same animal. That makes me think that cougar and mountain lion are alternative names for the same creature.I remember from before that sometimes animals have different common names in different regions. For example like how some people call a soda a pop and others call it a coke. It's just regional terms but refer to the same thing.The passage also mentions that these are all subnames or common names for Puma concolor. So scientifically they're classified under the same species. That supports the idea that cougar and mountain lion are the same animal.I don't see any indication in the passage that suggests they're different species or distinct animals. It's just using various terms to refer to one species. So I think it's safe to say that a cougar and a mountain lion are indeed the same.</think>True,True,False,0,0.0,43.19412070000544,0.015117132843583252,0.004438701467143648,0.016813800000818446,4.249811664016711e-06,1.2478322088809444e-06
80,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""log x"" is the same as ""ln x"". Let me start by reading the passage carefully. The passage says that the natural logarithm of a number is its logarithm to the base e which is approximately 2.71828. It mentions that the natural logarithm of x is generally written as ln x log x or sometimes just log x if the base e is implicit.Hmm so it seems like in some contexts ""log x"" can mean the natural logarithm especially when the base isn't specified and it's understood to be e. But wait I remember that usually ""log x"" without any base specified might refer to the common logarithm which is base 10 depending on the context or region. For example in some countries log x is assumed to be base 10 while in others especially in higher mathematics it could mean natural logarithm.The passage does mention that sometimes ""log x"" is used for clarity as ln(x) when the argument isn't a single symbol but I'm not sure if that means they're always the same. It says that log x can be written as ln x or log x implying that they are interchangeable in some contexts.Wait but the passage also clarifies that ""log x"" is sometimes used implicitly for base e. So maybe in mathematical literature especially when dealing with calculus and natural sciences ""log x"" often refers to the natural logarithm. However in other fields like engineering or general math it might still be base 10.So putting this together the passage suggests that ""log x"" can sometimes mean ln x but it's not universally the same because it depends on context and convention. Therefore the answer would depend on whether we're considering a specific context where log x is explicitly referring to natural logarithm or if it's in a general sense where it might be base 10.But wait the passage says that ""log x"" is generally written as ln x or log x when the base e is implicit. So maybe in the context of this passage they are considered the same because it's implying that log x refers to natural logarithm when not specified otherwise.I'm a bit confused now. On one hand I know that ""log x"" can sometimes be ambiguous depending on the field but according to the passage it seems like in mathematical contexts especially where base e is implied they are the same. So perhaps the answer is True because within this specific context as described in the passage log x refers to ln x.Wait no the question is whether ""log x"" is the same as ""ln x"". The passage says that sometimes log x is used for clarity as ln(x) but it doesn't explicitly state they are always the same. It just mentions that log x can be written as ln x or log x when the base e is implicit.So maybe in some contexts they're the same and in others they aren't. But since the passage says that ""log x"" is generally written as ln x or log x with the base e being implicit perhaps it's implying that in this context they are equivalent.I think I'm overcomplicating it. The passage directly states that the natural logarithm of x is sometimes written as log x when the base e is implicit. So yes in that case log x would be the same as ln x.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,49.469884399994044,0.017313124795835032,0.005083489920162572,0.019904400018276647,5.088280560610454e-06,1.4940239411342409e-06
81,<think>Alright let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a passage about Comcast and Time Warner Cable (TWC) and is asking whether they are the same company.First I'll read the passage carefully. It mentions that the Department of Justice was planning to file an antitrust lawsuit against Comcast and TWC because their merger would reduce competition. Then on April 24 2015 Comcast announced it was withdrawing its proposal to acquire TWC. After that TWC agreed to be acquired by Charter Communications.From this I can gather that at the time of the announcement Comcast and TWC were separate entities planning a merger but decided not to proceed. Instead TWC went with another company Charter. So they weren't the same company; they were two distinct companies involved in a potential merger that didn't happen.The user's question is straightforward: are Comcast and Time Warner Cable the same? Based on the passage the answer should be 'False' because they were separate entities.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,43.4558662000054,0.015207163366844743,0.004465136282516598,0.017420099989976734,4.430954443685348e-06,1.3010194587514745e-06
82,"<think>Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether I need a visa to visit Oman based on the passage provided. Let me read through it carefully.The passage says that citizens of member nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council can travel to Oman without any visa restrictions. That means if someone is from one of those GCC countries they don't need a visa at all. Then it mentions that nationals from 71 other countries and territories can apply for visas online which are valid for 30 days. So these people do need a visa but can get it online.The question is asking if you need a visa to visit Oman. The answer depends on where you're coming from. If you're from a GCC country no visa is needed. But if you're from one of the other 71 countries you do need a visa. However the passage also mentions that all visitors must have a passport valid for six months.Wait but the question is general: ""do you need a visa to visit Oman."" Since it's not specifying which country someone is coming from I think the answer should cover both possibilities. But in terms of whether it's always required or sometimes required the passage says some don't need it and others do. So the correct answer would be that it depends.But looking back at the instructions the user wants a simple 'True' or 'False' without any explanation. The question is phrased as ""do you need a visa to visit Oman."" Since not everyone needs one (GCC citizens don't) the statement isn't universally true. Therefore the answer should be False because it's not always required.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,45.691562100022566,0.015994915150348427,0.0046964364260929,0.04170729999896139,1.1109843980125848e-05,3.2620789460915246e-06

Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage says that Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are the No. 1 selling candy brand in the U.S. and consist of a milk white or dark chocolate cup filled with peanut butter. It also mentions they're marketed by The Hershey Company and created by H.B. Reese who left his job to start his own candy business.The question is asking if there's peanut butter in Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.

84,<think>Alright let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a passage about UK ministers responsible for certain territories and then asked if the Falkland Islands are part of the Commonwealth.First I need to understand the passage. It mentions that Tariq Ahmad is responsible for Territories excluding the Falklands Gibraltar and Sovereign Base Areas. Then Sir Alan Duncan handles the other three territories which aren't specified but likely include those excluded by Tariq.The question is whether the Falkland Islands are part of the Commonwealth. From the passage I know that the Falklands are under Tariq Ahmad's responsibility who is the Minister for the Commonwealth and the UN. That suggests a connection to the Commonwealth.I should recall general knowledge: The Falkland Islands are indeed a British Overseas Territory and part of the Commonwealth. They have been since 1985 when they joined as a member state under British sovereignty.So putting it together the passage implies that the Falklands fall under the Commonwealth portfolio and my prior knowledge confirms their membership.</think>True,True,False,0,0.0,43.344450900011,0.015180897205367925,0.004457423996682392,0.01680280000437051,4.2938883373328924e-06,1.260774027712575e-06

She decided to have the child and raise it alone because the father wasn't willing to change his lifestyle. There was also a scene at her baby shower with real-life journalists attending blending fiction and reality.The question is asking if Murphy Brown had a baby on the show. From the passage it clearly states that she became pregnant and chose to have the child.

86,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if the statement ""does a quarter pounder weigh a quarter pound"" is true or false based on the passage provided.First let me read the passage carefully. It says that the Quarter Pounder is a hamburger from McDonald's and it was named because the patty weighs a quarter of a pound which is 113.4 grams. That part seems straightforward—so initially the patty was a quarter pound.But then I notice something else in the passage. It mentions that in 2015 McDonald's increased the precooked weight to 4.25 oz which converts to about 120.5 grams. Wait so they changed the weight? That means after 2015 the patty isn't a quarter pound anymore.So the question is asking if a Quarter Pounder weighs a quarter pound. The answer depends on when you're considering it. Before 2015 yes but after that no. However the passage doesn't specify whether the current weight is still called the Quarter Pounder or if they changed the name. It says in 2013 the Quarter Pounder replaced the Angus hamburger line and then in 2015 they increased the weight.I think the key here is that the product was originally a quarter pound but later had its size increased. So the statement ""does a quarter pounder weigh a quarter pound"" would be false because after 2015 it doesn't anymore. Unless the question refers specifically to before 2015 but since it's not specified I have to assume it's about the current state.Therefore the answer should be False.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,42.47792489998392,0.014876098935300513,0.004367928948743765,0.020148999989032745,5.19730225491857e-06,1.5260349553578362e-06

The user has provided a passage about the United States' performance in the World Cup and is asking whether the US has ever won it.First I'll read the passage carefully. It mentions that the best result for the US was reaching the semifinals in 1930. Then in the modern era their best was getting to the quarterfinals in 2002. The worst results were first-round eliminations in 1990 1998 and 2006.The question is straightforward: did the US ever win the World Cup? From the passage I see that the highest they've reached is the semifinals and quarterfinals but there's no mention of a victory.

The question is asking whether there's a stand-your-ground law in Illinois.First I'll read the passage again carefully. It says that states which have adopted stand-your-ground laws include California Colorado Illinois New Mexico Oregon Virginia and Washington. So looking at this list Illinois is explicitly mentioned as one of them.Wait but sometimes states might have similar laws under different names or through case law rather than explicit statutes. The passage mentions that adoption can be through case law jury instructions or other means. Since the passage includes Illinois in the list it's clear that Illinois does have a stand-your-ground law either through statute case law or some other method.Therefore the answer should be True because Illinois is listed as having adopted such laws.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,39.229693800007226,0.013735198898881895,0.004032937206730655,0.024896599992644042,6.525545555794248e-06,1.916034537244366e-06

That clearly states that there's no such right in the UK. It goes on to mention that most handguns automatic and centerfire semi-automatic weapons are illegal without special permission. So the question is asking if Britain has the right to bear arms. From the passage it's clear that this right doesn't exist there.

90,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""fitness"" as used in biology and ""survival"" mean the same thing based on the passage provided. Let me read the passage again carefully.The passage says that Darwinian fitness is used to distinguish it from physical fitness. It clarifies that fitness doesn't include a measure of survival or lifespan. Then it interprets Herbert Spencer's phrase ""survival of the fittest"" as meaning the survival of the form (phenotypic or genotypic) that leaves the most copies of itself in successive generations.So from this I understand that biological fitness isn't about how long an organism survives but rather about its reproductive success. Survival is part of it but not the whole picture. Fitness is more about passing on genes so even if an organism doesn't live a long time if it reproduces successfully it's considered fit.The question asks if fitness and survival have the same meaning in biology. Based on the passage they don't because fitness is specifically about reproductive success and genetic contribution not just surviving.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,41.68051550001837,0.014594796799439083,0.0042853328495973085,0.022587999992538244,5.849945552472491e-06,1.7176644655531966e-06

Let me read through the passage again carefully.The passage starts by saying that thread seal tape is also known as PTFE tape or plumber's tape. It mentions that it's a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film tape used in plumbing for sealing pipe threads. Then it refers to Teflon tape as a genericized trademark. Wait so the passage says that while Teflon is identical to PTFE Chemours who own the trademark considers this usage incorrect because they don't make Teflon in tape form anymore.So thread seal tape is another name for PTFE tape and Teflon is a brand name for PTFE. Therefore thread seal tape and Teflon tape are essentially the same product just different names. The passage clarifies that Teflon is a trademark but notes that it's used generically which might be incorrect according to Chemours.So putting this together yes they are the same.</think>True,True,False,0,0.0,40.120294299995294,0.014050022567973686,0.004125375918247465,0.0237442999787163,6.1227977773847265e-06,1.7977794968599054e-06
92,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is part of the Constitution. Let me start by recalling what I know about both documents.The U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the land establishing the framework for the government and outlining fundamental principles like checks and balances and separation of powers. It includes amendments that have been added over time to address issues such as slavery citizenship rights voting rights etc.On the other hand the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a piece of legislation passed by Congress. I remember it was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson and it addresses discrimination based on race color religion sex or national origin. It includes provisions against segregation in schools employment and public places.I think the key here is understanding the difference between laws passed by Congress (like the Civil Rights Act) and amendments to the Constitution. The Constitution can only be amended through a specific process outlined in Article V which requires either two-thirds of both houses of Congress or conventions in 38 states agreeing to propose an amendment followed by ratification by 38 states.The Civil Rights Act was not proposed as a constitutional amendment; it's just regular legislation. Therefore it doesn't have the same legal weight as the Constitution but is still an important law that affects how people are treated in various aspects of society.So putting this together the answer should be False because the Civil Rights Act isn't part of the Constitution.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,42.52195359999314,0.014890332877387346,0.004372108327219683,0.013267399976029992,3.2973511076609912e-06,9.68170178214388e-07

It mentions that they were formerly known as the ""Sandwich Islands"" by Europeans and Americans. James Cook named them after John Montagu who was the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time. The current name comes from the largest island Hawaii Island.So yes the passage clearly states that Hawaii used to be called the Sandwich Islands.

94,"<think>Alright let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether ""The Tale of Despereaux"" is a Disney movie. First I need to recall what I know about the film.From the passage provided it mentions that the movie was produced by Gary Ross and Allison Thomas directed by Sam Fell and Robert Stevenhagen. It also notes that it's a computer-animated film released by Universal Pictures on December 19 2008. The production companies listed include Universal Animation Studios Framestore Feature Animation and Relativity Media.Disney is known for producing many animated films under their own label or through subsidiaries like Pixar Marvel or Lucasfilm. However ""The Tale of Despereaux"" was distributed by Universal Pictures not Disney. Additionally the production companies mentioned don't include any Disney affiliates.I should also consider if there's any connection between Disney and this movie. Sometimes studios collaborate but in this case it seems like Universal is handling both distribution and some production aspects. The passage doesn't mention Disney at all which strengthens the conclusion that it's not a Disney movie.Moreover checking external knowledge I recall that ""The Tale of Despereaux"" isn't associated with Disney. It was more of an independent project under Universal. Therefore based on both the passage and general knowledge the answer should be False.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,41.976223300007405,0.014704987724197588,0.004317687173955786,0.018336800014367327,4.657662783736467e-06,1.3675856953527318e-06
95,<think>Alright let me try to figure this out. The question is whether a batter gets an RBI on a fielder's choice based on the passage provided.First I need to understand what the passage says. It mentions that the official scorer determines if a run batted in (RBI) should be credited when a runner scores due to a fielder holding the ball or throwing it to the wrong base. The passage then goes into two scenarios:1. If the runner keeps going the scorer should credit an RBI.2. If the runner stops and takes off again upon noticing the misplay the run is scored on a fielder's choice.So in the first case the batter gets an RBI because the runner continues to score despite the fielder's mistake. In the second case since the runner stops and then leaves again it's considered a fielder's choice which might not result in an RBI for the batter.The question specifically asks if a batter gets an RBI on a fielder's choice. From the passage when the runner notices the misplay and stops the run is scored as a fielder's choice. That implies that in this scenario the batter does NOT get an RBI because it's not credited as such—it’s instead considered a fielder's choice play.Therefore the answer should be False.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,42.21321439999156,0.014787752050375504,0.004341988484252798,0.018120299995644018,4.610634440582039e-06,1.3537772054812215e-06
96,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the County Court Business Centre (CCBC) is a real court based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage says that CCBC is a center of the County Court of England and Wales created to handle claims using various electronic media. It also mentions that unlike other County Court centers CCBC doesn't physically hear cases. If a case requires a hearing it's transferred to another center.So from this I understand that CCBC isn't where actual court hearings take place because they don't have physical locations for that. Instead they handle claims electronically. Therefore even though it's part of the County Court system it doesn't function as a traditional real court with physical proceedings.Therefore the answer should be False because CCBC isn't a real court in the sense that it doesn't conduct physical hearings; it's more of an administrative or electronic processing center.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,43.3796906999778,0.01519702341513795,0.0044621589839122,0.03262640000320971,8.561310559161939e-06,2.5137770589715213e-06

I'll start by reading the passage carefully.The passage mentions that the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design after being discontinued in 1966. It also states that production continues but due to banking policies and low demand they're seldom seen in circulation. So even though they aren't common the fact that it's still part of U.S. currency suggests that the Bureau of Engraving and Printing would produce them as needed. Therefore yes $2 bills were still being made in 2018.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,39.72541169996839,0.013917527029776671,0.004086472500127758,0.040957000019261613,1.0826440002064273e-05,3.1788657027978255e-06
98,<think>Alright let's tackle this question step by step. The user provided a passage about Call of Duty: World at War and asked whether it's part of Black Ops. I need to determine if the answer is True or False based on the given information.First I'll read the passage carefully. It mentions that World at War is the fifth mainstream game in the Call of Duty series and notes that it returns the setting to World War II. Importantly it states that this game is also the first title in the Black Ops storyline. So according to the passage World at War is indeed part of the Black Ops series.I should make sure there's no confusion with other games or storylines. The passage doesn't mention any other titles conflicting with this information. It clearly links World at War as the start of Black Ops. Therefore the answer should be True.</think>True,True,False,0,0.0,34.15897800002131,0.011954802460571649,0.003510176153785391,0.023481599986553192,6.1006750616477404e-06,1.7912838120091474e-06
99,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether quantum entanglement can transfer information faster than light. The passage provided talks about this in detail. Let me break it down.First the passage mentions that quantum entanglement doesn't allow any influence or information to travel faster than light. It refers to the microscopic causality postulate in axiomatic quantum field theory which makes superluminal communication impossible using phenomena described by orthodox quantum field theory. Then there's the no-communication theorem which specifically stops communication if two observers share a composite entangled system and are spacelike-separated. The passage also notes that some authors argue using the no-communication theorem to prove no faster-than-light information transfer is circular because the theorem assumes the system is composite.So putting this together: the main point is that quantum entanglement can't be used for superluminal communication or information transfer. Even though there are debates about the reasoning (circularity) the established understanding is that it doesn't allow faster-than-light information transfer.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,38.62580899999011,0.013521900740041507,0.003970308475450719,0.03064079998875968,8.043050596832658e-06,2.361605262973232e-06
100,<think>Alright let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a passage about Corinthian leather and asked whether it actually exists. First I need to read the passage carefully.The passage says that Corinthian leather was coined by Bozell for Chrysler vehicles in 1974. It mentions that despite the name suggesting a connection to Corinth there's no real link—it's just a marketing term. So the key points are: it's a made-up term for marketing purposes and doesn't have an actual origin related to Corinth.Now the question is straightforward: does such a thing as Corinthian leather exist? Based on the passage it's clear that while the term was used in advertising there's no real product or material called Corinthian leather. It's entirely fictional for marketing.I should make sure I'm only answering with 'True' or 'False' without any explanations. Since the passage explicitly states it's a marketing concept and not an actual product the answer is False.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,33.70081430001301,0.011795340659896032,0.0034633548857621577,0.021936200006166473,5.735731700406176e-06,1.6841289269044067e-06
101,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether tonic water and quinine water are the same thing based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage says that tonic water is a carbonated soft drink with dissolved quinine. It mentions that it was originally used against malaria but now has less quinine for flavor which is bitter like sour grapefruit. It's often used in mixed drinks like gin and tonic.Now the question is asking if tonic water and quinine water are the same thing. From the passage I see that tonic water contains quinine but it doesn't explicitly say that quinine water is another name for it. Instead it describes tonic water as a specific type of drink with quinine. So maybe quinine water refers to something else or is just another term for tonic water.Wait the passage starts by saying ""tonic water (or Indian tonic water)"" which suggests that there are variations but still under the same category. It doesn't mention quinine water as a separate entity. Therefore it's likely that they're referring to the same thing because both contain quinine and serve similar purposes.So putting it together I think the answer is True.</think>True",True,False,0,0.0,38.44470430002548,0.013463937298424633,0.003953289215515147,0.011235199985094368,2.758867235952738e-06,8.100602260087904e-07
102,<think>Alright let's tackle this question. The user is asking if any of the original members of Lynyrd Skynyrd are still alive. I remember from the passage that there was a tragic plane crash in 1977 which killed several band members including Ronnie Van Zant Steve Gaines and Cassie Gaines. The passage also mentions that after the crash the group disbanded. However it later talks about surviving members reuniting for a performance in 1979.

Importantly it states that a third-place playoff was held between the two losing semi-final teams.The user's question is straightforward: they want to know if such a playoff exists. From the passage it's clear that yes there was a third-place match.

104,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if the statement ""is there no sales tax in new hampshire"" is true or false based on the given passage. Let me read the passage carefully.The passage says that since January 2017 five states don't levy a statewide sales tax. These states are Alaska Delaware Montana New Hampshire and Oregon. It also mentions that California has the highest state sales tax at 7.25%. Additionally it notes that Puerto Rico has a higher VAT rate.Now focusing on New Hampshire: the passage explicitly lists New Hampshire as one of the five states without a statewide sales tax. So if someone is asking whether there's no sales tax in New Hampshire according to the passage that would be true because New Hampshire is included in the list of states without such taxes.I should make sure I'm not missing any details. The passage doesn't mention any local or county-level taxes for these five states only that they don't have a statewide sales tax.

105,"<think>Alright let's tackle this question step by step. The user provided a passage about the history of San Luis Rey Mission and asked whether it was ""always"" a mission.First I'll read the passage carefully. It mentions that in 1834 the mission was secularized meaning religious services stopped and the Luiseño people were left behind as Franciscan padres fled. Then in 1893 two Mexican priests restarted the religious services leading to its restoration as a Franciscan college. The mission was restored further by Father Joseph O'Keefe starting in 1895 with major construction completed in 1905. Later it became San Luis Rey College a seminary from 1950 until it closed in 1969.The question is whether San Luis Rey de Francia was always a mission. From the passage after secularization in 1834 services stopped so it wasn't functioning as a mission during that time. It later became a college and seminary which are different from a traditional mission. Therefore it wasn't always a mission; its status changed over time.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,33.949141700024484,0.0118817014107128,0.003488712180384116,0.01754959998652339,4.4977583333901644e-06,1.3206344562719558e-06

Then it goes on to say that at the beginning of the film Livvy Stubenrauch and Katie Lopez provided her speaking and singing voice as a young child respectively. Additionally Agatha Lee Monn portrayed her as a nine-year-old (singing).So putting this together: Kristen Bell is the adult voice while other actresses handled the younger Anna's speaking and singing parts. The question is asking if Kristen Bell sang all of Anna's voices.From the passage it's clear that for the young Anna both speaking and singing were done by different people—Livvy for speaking and Katie for singing. Agatha Lee Monn also did some singing as a nine-year-old. So Kristen Bell only did the adult voice not the younger ones.Therefore the answer should be False because she didn't sing all of Anna's voices; others handled the younger parts.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,35.98749709999538,0.012597974340782393,0.003699024660830744,0.019890100025804713,5.1160250059587665e-06,1.5021702815512277e-06

It mentions that Paige announced the renewal for a fourth season in February 2015 with filming starting at the end of that month. The premiere was set for July 7 2015 moving from Sunday to Tuesday nights.Now the question is about ""Total Bellas "" which I know is another WWE reality series but it's different from ""Total Divas."" The passage doesn't mention anything about ""Total Bellas"" at all.

It says that the fourteenth season was ordered by ABC on February 10 2017 and it premiered in September 2017. That already confirms that the season exists because it's mentioned as having been ordered and premiered.The passage also provides details like the number of episodes (24) some production companies involved and the showrunners. All these specifics indicate that the season was indeed produced and aired.So when the question is asking if there's going to be a 14th season I can confidently say it's true because the passage explicitly states that the fourteenth season was ordered and went on air.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,36.31673619998037,0.012718957445102996,0.003734547791321417,0.03645200000028126,9.59180278506757e-06,2.816350794502925e-06
109,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the October Revolution is the same as the Bolshevik Revolution. Let me start by recalling what I know about these events.The October Revolution was a significant event in Russian history. From what I remember it happened in 1917 and was led by the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin. The Bolsheviks were a Marxist group that wanted to establish a socialist state. They seized power during this revolution which is often seen as the start of the Soviet Union.Now the term ""Bolshevik Revolution"" seems like it might be another name for the same event. Bolshevik refers to members of the majority faction in the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party which later became the Communist Party. Since they were leading the charge it makes sense that this revolution would be called the Bolshevik Revolution.Looking at the passage provided it mentions that the October Revolution is also referred to as ""Red October "" ""the October Uprising "" ""the Bolshevik Revolution "" or ""the Bolshevik Coup."" This clearly states that these are alternative names for the same event. Therefore the October Revolution and the Bolshevik Revolution are indeed the same.I don't see any conflicting information in the passage. It consistently refers to the same revolution by multiple names including Bolshevik Revolution. So it's safe to conclude that they are the same.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,36.52139529999113,0.012789061344961133,0.003755131739770669,0.011434099986217916,2.854073888576951e-06,8.380148595399966e-07

Let me read the passage again carefully.The passage says that Jan Struther wrote this Christian hymn which was published in 1931. It mentions that the hymn is used in liturgy at weddings and at the beginning of funeral services. So the question is asking specifically if it's a funeral hymn. The passage lists three uses: liturgy weddings and funerals. Since it's explicitly mentioned as being used at the beginning of funeral services that indicates it's associated with funerals.I should consider whether just being used in one part of a funeral makes it a funeral hymn or if it's primarily known for that purpose. The passage doesn't say it's only used for funerals; it also mentions weddings and liturgy. However the question is about whether it's a funeral hymn not its primary use.In many contexts a hymn can be categorized based on where it's commonly used. Since ""Lord of All Hopefulness"" is used at the start of funerals it's likely recognized as a funeral hymn. Therefore the answer should be True.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,36.48423800000455,0.01278095511895918,0.00375275158490796,0.01705909997690469,4.355981110711582e-06,1.2790057444770403e-06
111,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if the heat from a hair dryer can kill lice based on the passage provided. Let me read the passage again carefully.The passage says that a standard home blow dryer will kill 96.7% of eggs with proper technique. It also mentions that to be effective the dryer must be used repeatedly every 1 to 7 days because eggs hatch in 7 to 10 days. This process needs to continue until the natural life cycle of the lice is over which is about four weeks.So the question is asking if the heat from a hair dryer can kill lice. The passage specifically talks about killing eggs not the adult lice themselves. It mentions that repeated use is necessary because the eggs take time to hatch and the life cycle is longer than just one treatment.I think the key here is whether the heat kills both the eggs and the adult lice or just the eggs. Since the passage focuses on the effectiveness against eggs it might not directly address adult lice. However sometimes when you kill the eggs you're also disrupting the environment where the adults live which could indirectly help in killing them.But wait the question is about whether the heat can kill lice not just the eggs. The passage doesn't explicitly state that the dryer kills adult lice only that it's effective against eggs when used properly and repeatedly. So maybe the answer is no because it specifically targets eggs but I'm not entirely sure.Alternatively perhaps using a hair dryer on the scalp can create an environment where both eggs and adults are affected by the heat. But since the passage doesn't mention killing adult lice directly just the eggs I might lean towards saying that the heat from a hair dryer isn't confirmed to kill lice in general only the eggs.Wait but sometimes when you remove the eggs it's harder for the lice to survive because they lose their food source. So maybe indirectly yes but the passage doesn't explicitly say that the heat kills adult lice. It just talks about killing eggs and needing repeated use.Hmm I'm a bit confused here. The question is whether the heat can kill lice not just the eggs. Since the passage says it's effective against eggs with proper technique maybe the answer is yes because the process involves using heat to target both eggs and possibly adults over time.But I think the key point is that the passage doesn't state that the hair dryer kills adult lice directly; it only mentions killing eggs. So perhaps the answer is no because while it's effective against eggs there's no direct mention of killing the lice themselves.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,43.15585120001924,0.015118120296904645,0.0044389914037706365,0.013851900002919137,3.4645849961735723e-06,1.0172734912551287e-06
112,<think>Okay I need to determine if a peck is the same as a bushel based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage says that two pecks make a kenning which is obsolete and four pecks make a bushel. So it's clear that a bushel is made up of four pecks. Therefore a peck is not the same as a bushel; instead a bushel is a larger unit composed of multiple pecks.I should also consider if there's any other information in the passage that might suggest they are the same but I don't see anything indicating that. The passage mentions that although the peck isn't widely used anymore some products like apples are still sold by the peck.

113,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether cougars and mountain lions are the same. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.The passage says that the cougar also commonly known as the puma mountain lion panther or catamount. So right there it lists several names for the same animal. That suggests that these terms are all referring to one species.It mentions that the cougar is a large felid native to the Americas and describes its range. It also talks about how it's an adaptable species found in various habitats. The passage then goes on to compare it with other big cats like the jaguar but doesn't mention any differences between cougars and mountain lions.Since the passage lists ""mountain lion"" as another common name for the cougar that indicates they are the same animal. There's no indication of different species or subspecies; it's just alternative names used in different regions or contexts.I don't see any part of the passage suggesting that cougars and mountain lions are distinct.

114,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if someone can die from a bullet that's been shot into the air. Let me start by reading the passage carefully.The passage says that bullets fired into the air usually have lower terminal velocities than their muzzle velocity. That means when they come back down they're not as fast as when they were first fired. But it also mentions that people can be injured or even killed when these bullets fall back to the ground. So that directly answers the question—yes someone can die from a bullet shot into the air.Wait but there's more. The passage explains that bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous because they maintain their trajectory and don't tumble as much. This makes them travel faster increasing the risk of injury or death when they hit the ground. So even though the terminal velocity is lower the angle affects how dangerous they are.So putting it all together the passage clearly states that fatalities can occur from bullets discharged into the air. Therefore the answer should be 'True'.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,38.33137679999345,0.013444042114396692,0.0039474475798394115,0.024668400001246482,6.348834443391145e-06,1.8641485161317592e-06
115,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if the hand A-2-3-4-5 is considered a straight in poker. Let me start by recalling what a straight is. In poker a straight is five cards of sequential rank. The key here is understanding how aces are treated.From the passage it says that under high rules an ace can be either high or low but not both. So for example A-2-3-4-5 would be considered a low straight like a five-high straight because the ace acts as the lowest card here. But wait in some variations especially with different rules like deuce-to-seven or ace-to-six the ace's ranking changes.The passage also mentions that under ace-to-five low rules straight flushes aren't recognized and are instead treated as high card hands. So if we're following those specific rules A-2-3-4-5 wouldn't be a straight flush but just high cards. However the question is about whether it's a straight not necessarily a straight flush.I think in standard poker rules an ace can act as low to make a 5-high straight (like A-2-3-4-5) or high for something like 10-J-Q-K-A. So yes that hand should be considered a straight under normal circumstances.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,40.810957100009546,0.014314331032061811,0.004202982325458765,0.09468510001897812,2.5769458603257078e-05,7.566443643334566e-06
116,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""Vertical Limit"" is based on a true story. Let me start by recalling what I know about the movie. It's a 2000 American survival thriller directed by Martin Campbell and written by Robert King. The main actors include Chris O'Donnell Bill Paxton Robin Tunney and Scott Glenn.I remember that ""Vertical Limit"" is about mountain climbers who get stranded on Mount Everest during a storm. They have to survive the harsh conditions while dealing with personal conflicts and the dangers of the mountain. Now I'm trying to think if this story is based on real events or if it's entirely fictional.From what I know there are several true stories involving mountaineering disasters like the famous 1988 accident on K2 where many climbers died due to a storm and avalanches. However ""Vertical Limit"" doesn't seem to be directly based on that specific event. Instead it appears to be more of an fictionalized account meant for dramatic effect.I also recall that the movie was inspired by some real-life mountaineering incidents but wasn't tied to any single true story. The plot elements such as the climbers being stuck in a storm and dealing with interpersonal issues are common themes in survival stories but aren't based on specific real events.Additionally looking at the details from the passage provided: it mentions that the film was released by Columbia Pictures and grossed $215 million worldwide. There's no indication here that it's based on a true story; instead it's categorized as a thriller which often involves fictional narratives meant to entertain with suspense and drama.So putting this all together ""Vertical Limit"" is not based on a real-life incident but is an fictional survival thriller.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,41.51054839999415,0.014560756519298144,0.004275337922452925,0.026340800017351285,7.132644126430855e-06,2.0942911778433366e-06

I remember that the World Series is the championship of Major League Baseball where the American League and National League teams compete.Looking at the passage provided it says ""They have won nine World Series championships the third-most of all current MLB teams."" That clearly states they've won multiple times. The number nine is significant showing a strong history in the league.I don't see any information that contradicts this statement. It mentions their location and division but focuses on their achievements including the nine titles. So based on this passage it's definitely true that the Oakland Athletics have won a World Series.I think I'm confident enough to say 'True' without needing more details because the passage explicitly states their championships.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,41.29942380002467,0.01449159788551979,0.004255031523587883,0.053629000001819804,1.4264467220345979e-05,4.188341283634859e-06

Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage starts by talking about bilaterians having a gastrointestinal tract which includes structures from the mouth to the anus. It mentions that in humans the GI tract consists of the esophagus stomach and intestines divided into upper and lower tracts. Then it says the GI tract includes all structures between the mouth and anus including the main organs like stomach small intestine and large intestine.Next the passage explains that the complete human digestive system is made up of the GI tract plus accessory organs of digestion. These accessory organs are listed as the tongue salivary glands pancreas liver and gallbladder. So here it clearly states that the liver is an accessory organ not part of the GI tract itself.The passage also mentions that the GI tract can be divided into foregut midgut and hindgut based on embryological origins. However since the liver isn't mentioned in these divisions and it's explicitly listed as an accessory organ I can conclude that the liver is not part of the GI tract.Therefore the answer should be False because the liver is considered an accessory organ rather than a component of the gastrointestinal tract.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,42.95527090001269,0.015074699252969304,0.004426242091224737,0.013893800001824275,3.4668488890424166e-06,1.0179382168153503e-06

The user is asking if they can buy alcohol on Sunday in Wisconsin based on the provided passage.First I'll read through the passage carefully to understand the laws regarding bar closing times and any exceptions or additional rules about alcohol sales.The passage mentions that state law requires bars to close between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. Monday through Friday and between 2:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday. So during these hours bars must be closed.However there are exceptions. On New Year's Eve no closing is required meaning bars can stay open all night. Additionally changes in Daylight Saving Time might affect closing times but that doesn't directly impact whether alcohol can be sold on Sundays.The passage also states that municipalities cannot further restrict when bars must close beyond what state law dictates. But municipalities do have the authority to prohibit issuing liquor licenses making them effectively dry. This means some towns in Wisconsin might not allow any alcohol sales including on Sundays.So putting this together: State law allows bars to be open on Sundays after 6:00 a.m. but before that time they must close. However if a municipality chooses to make itself dry by not issuing liquor licenses then no alcohol can be sold there regardless of the day.Therefore in most places in Wisconsin you can buy alcohol on Sunday during business hours (after 6:00 a.m.) but some municipalities might have restrictions based on their own policies.</think>True,True,False,0,0.0,43.80430210000486,0.015379340354182383,0.004515690991151599,0.011719900008756667,2.8502522169017334e-06,8.368927380473003e-07

It mentions that this can lead to twin babies from two separate biological fathers. There's a term called heteropaternal superfecundation which specifically refers to the fertilization of two separate ova by two different fathers. So in this case twins would have different fathers.The passage also explains that while this is rare it can happen through either multiple sexual acts or artificial insemination. It clarifies that these twins are half siblings genetically because each comes from a different father but the same mother.So putting it all together yes it's possible for a person to have twins with different fathers due to heteropaternal superfecundation.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,43.006274899991695,0.015101700555613459,0.004434170229642353,0.023021899978630245,6.002285555425462e-06,1.7623946271260666e-06
121,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the answer to the question ""Can anyone give last rites in an emergency?"" is True or False based on the provided passage. Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage talks about the Catholic Church's view of the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick also known as the Last Rites. It mentions that this sacrament provides grace for people who are sick and helps them with their faith during times of sickness especially regarding death. It states that through the sacrament a gift of the Holy Spirit is given to renew confidence in God and strengthen against discouragement despair etc.Importantly the passage says: ""Because one of the effects of the sacrament is to absolve the recipient of any sins not previously absolved through the sacrament of penance only an ordained priest or bishop may administer the sacrament."" So it clearly states that only priests or bishops can give this sacrament.Now the question is about whether anyone can give last rites in an emergency. From the passage it's clear that only ordained clergy (priests or bishops) are allowed to administer the sacrament. There's no mention of exceptions for emergencies. Therefore if someone isn't a priest or bishop they cannot perform the Anointing of the Sick even in an emergency.So the answer should be False because it specifies that only priests or bishops can do it regardless of the situation.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,44.68128920000163,0.015687413194199504,0.004606147520251398,0.013332200003787875,3.3155438941321334e-06,9.735119549148003e-07

It mentions that some physicians have falsely concluded it's superficial because of the adjective leading to patients with DVT not receiving proper treatment. So the key point is that the femoral vein is a deep vein.Therefore when the question asks if the common femoral vein is a deep vein the answer should be True.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,43.67410200001905,0.015335614313612276,0.004502852125313803,0.022540900012245402,5.8677105585552955e-06,1.722880637123524e-06
123,"<think>Alright let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether Garfield is a real cat in the movie. I need to determine if that's true or false based on the passage provided.First I'll read through the passage carefully. It mentions that Garfield was created with computer animation while all other animals were real. So this clearly indicates that Garfield isn't a real cat but an animated character. I should make sure there are no contradictions in the passage. The rest of the details about the movie's production and release don't affect the answer to this specific question. The key point is the use of computer animation for Garfield.Therefore the statement ""is garfield a real cat in the movie"" is false because he was animated.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,44.29617920002784,0.015563279673029024,0.0045696993625059966,0.020976100000552833,5.304979999911867e-06,1.5576513583904617e-06
124,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the internal resistance of a battery changes based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage starts by saying that a battery can be modeled as a voltage source in series with a resistance. It then mentions that the internal resistance depends on several factors: size chemical properties age temperature and discharge current. That already suggests that the resistance isn't constant because it varies with these different conditions.Further it breaks down the internal resistance into two components: electronic and ionic. The electronic part is due to the resistivity of materials while the ionic component involves factors like electrolyte conductivity ion mobility and electrode surface area. All of these can change over time or under different circumstances which implies that the overall internal resistance isn't fixed.The passage also talks about measuring the internal resistance as an indicator of the battery's condition but notes that this measurement is specific to test conditions. This means that external factors during testing can affect the measured resistance showing that it's not a static value.Additionally it mentions that using alternating current at 1 kHz might underestimate the resistance because higher frequencies don't account for slower electrochemical processes. This indicates that the method of measurement affects the result further supporting that internal resistance isn't constant—it depends on how you measure it and under what conditions.Finally the passage provides specific examples with temperature changes. A fresh Energizer E91 AA battery's internal resistance drops from about 0.9 Ω at -40°C to 0.15 Ω at room temperature and further down to 0.1 Ω at 40°C. This clear variation with temperature alone shows that the internal resistance does change.Putting it all together every factor mentioned—size chemical properties age temperature discharge current—affects the internal resistance. The examples given especially the temperature effect clearly demonstrate changes in resistance. Therefore the answer should be 'True' because the internal resistance of a battery definitely changes based on various conditions.</think>The passage explicitly states that internal resistance depends on factors like temperature among others and provides specific numerical examples showing variation with temperature. Therefore it is clear that internal resistance does change.Answer: True,True,True,1,1.0,47.85039940002025,0.01682298638192673,0.00493957518980802,0.028115799999795854,7.344303335089029e-06,2.156438679603519e-06
125,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""The Young and the Restless"" is going off the air based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully.First the passage mentions that the show has won nine Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series. That's a good sign of its success. It also says it's currently the highest-rated daytime drama on American TV. High ratings usually mean the show is popular and likely to continue because networks want to keep successful shows on air.Next the passage talks about the show's longevity. As of 2008 it had been at the top of the weekly Nielsen ratings for over 1 000 weeks since 1988. That's a really long time and shows that the show has been consistently popular. Then as of December 12 2013 it was leading for an unprecedented 1 300 weeks which is about 25 years. This indicates that the show has been running continuously without stopping for a very long period.Additionally the passage notes that ""The Young and the Restless"" is a sister series to ""The Bold and the Beautiful "" with some actors crossing over between the two shows. While this information doesn't directly relate to whether it's going off the air it does show that the show has established connections and perhaps a stable position in its network's lineup.Finally the passage states that in June 2017 ""The Young and the Restless"" was renewed for three additional years. Renewal is a strong indicator that the show will continue airing. Networks typically renew shows they want to keep on their schedules because it means they're profitable or have significant audience appeal.Putting this all together: The show has been on air since at least 1988 has had high ratings for over 25 years and was renewed in 2017 for three more years. There's no mention of any plans to stop airing the show after that renewal. Therefore it's reasonable to conclude that ""The Young and the Restless"" is not going off the air.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,47.93517750001047,0.01684898866255088,0.004947209994790532,0.02279320001252927,5.94543111251874e-06,1.7457009920462627e-06
126,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if the cortex of the cerebellum is considered gray matter based on the passage provided. Let me read through the passage carefully.The passage says that grey matter is distributed at the surface of the cerebral hemispheres (cerebral cortex) and of the cerebellum (cerebellar cortex) as well as in deeper brain regions like the thalamus hypothalamus subthalamus basal ganglia and others. It also mentions the deep cerebellar nuclei but refers to them separately.So the passage explicitly states that the cerebellar cortex is part of the grey matter. The question is asking specifically about the cortex of the cerebellum which aligns with what's mentioned in the passage. Therefore the answer should be True.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,46.46654629998375,0.016342544108991004,0.0047985074460881625,0.05821040002047084,1.565554127232538e-05,4.596789267741008e-06
127,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if ""The Greatest Showman"" is based on a true story. Let me start by recalling what I know about the movie. It's a musical film from 2017 directed by Michael Gracey and written by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon. The main actors include Hugh Jackman who plays P.T. Barnum.I remember that P.T. Barnum was a real person known for creating the Barnum & Bailey Circus. So the movie is definitely inspired by his life and the circus he created. But I'm not sure if every detail in the film is accurate or if it's more of a fictionalized version.I think historical movies often take creative liberties so even if they're based on real events they might not be entirely true to every aspect. The passage mentions that the film is ""inspired by"" P.T. Barnum's story which suggests that it's not a strict adaptation but rather an artistic interpretation.So putting this together while the movie is loosely based on his life and the circus it's not a completely accurate depiction of real events. Therefore saying it's based on a true story might be misleading because it's more of a fictionalized account.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,48.171861499984516,0.016928720068602708,0.004970620777290198,0.016551899985643104,4.245836666410065e-06,1.2466650677377745e-06
