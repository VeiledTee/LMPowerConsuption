4,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light , found even in unicellular organisms , called `` eyespots '' . Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness : they can distinguish light from dark , sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms . They are insufficient for vision , as they can not distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from . Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups , and are common among unicellular organisms , including euglena . The euglena 's eyespot , called a stigma , is located at its anterior end . It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals . Together with the leading flagellum , the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light , often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis , and to predict day and night , the primary function of circadian rhythms . Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms , and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles . By detecting the subtle changes in night - time illumination , organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation .

17,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume , so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals . The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids .

43,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: In 1910 , in conjunction with advocacy work led by Florence Kelley of the National Consumer League , the Women 's Trade Union League ( WTLU ) of Massachusetts under the leadership of Elizabeth Evans took up the cause of minimum wage legislation in Massachusetts . Over the next two years , a coalition of social reform groups and labor advocates in Boston pushed for minimum wage legislation in the state . In 1912 , Massachusetts passed the first American minimum wage legislation , which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children . Within eight years , at least thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia would pass minimum wage laws , with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women 's voluntary associations and organized labor . The United States Supreme Court of the Lochner era consistently invalidated compulsory minimum wage laws . Advocates for these minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of Muller v. Oregon , which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not . However , the Court did not extend this principle to minimum wage laws , considering the latter as interfering with the ability of employers to freely negotiate wage contracts with employees .

Throughout the $2 bill 's pre-1929 life as a large - sized note , it was issued as a United States Note , National Bank Note , silver certificate , Treasury or `` Coin '' Note and Federal Reserve Bank Note . When U.S. currency was changed to its current size , the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note . Production went on until 1966 , when the series was discontinued . Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design . Two - dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand . This comparative scarcity in circulation , coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation , has also inspired urban legends and occasionally has created problems for people trying to use the bill to make purchases .

Context: It was suggested that the interior of the 45 metre ( 147 ft ) wide dome should be covered with a mosaic decoration to make the most of the available light coming through the circular windows of the drum and through the lantern . Brunelleschi had proposed the vault to glimmer with resplendent gold , but his death in 1446 put an end to this project , and the walls of the dome were whitewashed . Grand Duke Cosimo I de ' Medici decided to have the dome painted with a representation of The Last Judgment . This enormous work , 3,600 metres2 ( 38 750 ft2 ) of painted surface , was started in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari and would last till 1579 . The upper portion , near the lantern , representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574 . Federico Zuccari and a number of collaborators , such as Domenico Cresti , finished the other portions : ( from top to bottom ) Choirs of Angels ; Christ , Mary and Saints ; Virtues , Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes ; and at the bottom of the cupola : Capital Sins and Hell . These frescoes are considered Zuccari 's greatest work . But the quality of the work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques . Vasari had used true fresco , while Zuccari had painted in secco . During the restoration work , which ended in 1995 , the entire pictorial cycle of The Last Judgment was photographed with specially designed equipment and all the information collected in a catalogue . All the restoration information along with reconstructed images of the frescos were stored and managed in the Thesaurus Florentinus computer system .

Context: Luke -- Acts is an attempt to answer a theological problem , namely how the Messiah of the Jews came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church ; the answer it provides , and its central theme , is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the Jews rejected it . Luke -- Acts can be also seen as a defense of ( or `` apology '' for ) the Jesus movement addressed to the Jews : the bulk of the speeches and sermons in Acts are addressed to Jewish audiences , with the Romans serving as external arbiters on disputes concerning Jewish customs and law . On the one hand Luke portrays the Christians as a sect of the Jews , and therefore entitled to legal protection as a recognised religion ; on the other , Luke seems unclear as to the future God intends for Jews and Christians , celebrating the Jewishness of Jesus and his immediate followers while also stressing how the Jews had rejected God 's promised Messiah .

96,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: Gavin Shipman ( Mathew Horne ) - Gavin is 28 when the series starts . He is an only child , and when the series starts he still lives with his loving mother and father in Billericay , Essex . He gets on well with his parents . He works for a company called ICB and spends his spare time with his best friend Smithy ( James Corden ) along with his other friends Gary & Simon , Dirtbox , Fingers , Budgie , Swede , Chinese Alan and Jesus . He is a big fan of Tottenham Hotspur ( as is Mathew Horne ) and is often seen wearing his Spurs shirt . In the course of his job , he had to deal with a company called Bedmores , based in Barry . The Bedmores representative he had to correspond with was a woman called Stacey West ( Joanna Page ) . Gavin and Stacey had to speak regularly because of their jobs , and they found they got on very well . After months and months of talking and flirting , they agreed to meet up in London . They agreed that Gavin would bring his best friend Smithy with him , and Stacey would bring her best friend Nessa ( Ruth Jones ) with her . They met up and went clubbing . They had a great time , and got on very well . They went back to Stacey 's hotel room and had sex . The next day , Stacey had to go back to Barry , but she and Gavin promised to keep ringing each other and that this would not be the end of their relationship . While Stacey and Nessa boarded the coach back to Barry , Gavin and Smithy got a cab back to Billericay . Without waiting for Smithy , Gavin jumped in his car and drove all the way to Barry , and met Stacey when her coach pulled into the station , to her surprise . He and Stacey told each other they loved each other for the first time . Within 9 weeks , they had got engaged and married . Despite a few initial problems regarding Stacey being homesick , their relationship was successful , and Stacey became eventually pregnant . Gavin , and his father Mick ( Larry Lamb ) , often play the `` straight men '' in the series . Much of the comedy comes from the actions of those around them ( especially his mother Pam ( Alison Steadman ) and Smithy ) . It is clear that Gavin loves his friends and family very much . Despite the fact that his mother Pam often overreacts and acts without thinking , Gavin still loves her , despite being occasionally exasperated by her . His best friend Smithy is also prone to overreact , but Gavin sticks with him and loves him like a little brother . Gavin 's main personality flaw is that he is slightly spoiled , possibly due to being an only child , and reacts with irritation when he does n't get his way . He is also not particularly sensitive - he sometimes fails to understand the much more emotional Smithy and Stacey , and this occasionally puts strain on his relationship with both of them - when Stacey , who is very attached to her hometown of Barry , gets depressed and homesick upon moving to Billericay after she and Gavin marry , Gavin is more confused than concerned about this , and his responses are lacking in sensitivity about the matter . This can also be seen in the fact that Gavin is less talkative and expressive than Stacey is - while at dinner with their families after their honeymoon , Stacey is excited and full of conversation , while Gavin simply sits and listens to her . Despite all of this , Gavin loves Stacey enormously , and is very affectionate towards her , and his greatest display of love for her is when he decides to move to Barry with her despite having expressed a dislike of it previously , and he manages to get himself a new job in Wales so he can reside there . There , his boss Huw Davies and colleague Owain Hughes ( Steven Meo ) act very similar to Stacey 's uncle , Bryn ( Rob Brydon ) , talking incessantly and being over-friendly , personality traits that bewilder Gavin . Gavin is more reserved and less willing to discuss his private life than his wife . He finds it odd that Stacey is so eager and ready to spill information about their private life to Nessa , Bryn , her mother Gwen ( Melanie Walters ) and her brother Jason ( Robert Wilfort ) . When Gavin is applying for a job in Cardiff , the only people who know are Stacey and Mick . When he and Stacey announce it to the rest of the characters , Gwen announces that she knew as well , because Stacey told her . Gavin is annoyed that Stacey told Gwen , and by the fact that Stacey did not tell him she had told Gwen . He does n't understand why Stacey always has to be so close to her family . It is n't that he is distant from his family , he just does n't depend on his as much as Stacey does hers . In Series 3 , he agrees with Stacey to try to have a baby , only to discover she stopped taking the pill a year ago . Although he is very angry about Stacey not telling him the truth , he becomes much more depressed when he learns that he has fertility problems . However , he eventually comes round , and has a serious discussion with Stacey about the problem , deciding they will carry on trying to conceive for a few months , and if that does n't work , they should start looking at alternatives .

117,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges , where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge . Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year .

The main forms of precipitation include drizzle , rain , sleet , snow , graupel and hail . Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor , so that the water condenses and `` precipitates '' . Thus , fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions , because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate . Two processes , possibly acting together , can lead to air becoming saturated : cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air . Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud . Short , intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called `` showers . ''

Context: Mendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants : plant height , pod shape and color , seed shape and color , and flower position and color . Taking seed color as an example , Mendel showed that when a true - breeding yellow pea and a true - breeding green pea were cross-bred their offspring always produced yellow seeds . However , in the next generation , the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow . To explain this phenomenon , Mendel coined the terms `` recessive '' and `` dominant '' in reference to certain traits . ( In the preceding example , the green trait , which seems to have vanished in the first filial generation , is recessive and the yellow is dominant . ) He published his work in 1866 , demonstrating the actions of invisible `` factors '' -- now called genes -- in predictably determining the traits of an organism .

Transition economics investigates how an economy should reform itself to endorse capitalism and democracy . There are usually two sides : one which argues for a rapid transformation and one which argues for a gradual approach . Gérard Roland 's book Transition and Economics . Politics , Markets and Firms ( MIT Press 2000 ) gives a good overview of the field . A more recent overview is provided in Transition Economies : Political Economy in Russia , Eastern Europe , and Central Asia by Martin Myant and Jan Drahokoupil .

175,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: The kudzu plant was introduced to the United States from Japan in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia . Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition . The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi . It has been recorded in Nova Scotia , Canada , in Columbus , Ohio , and in all five boroughs of New York City .

181,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: Plasmodesmata ( singular : plasmodesma ) are microscopic channels which traverse the cell walls of plant cells and some algal cells , enabling transport and communication between them . Plasmodesmata evolved independently in several lineages , and species that have these structures include members of the Charophyceae , Charales , Coleochaetales and Phaeophyceae ( which are all algae ) , as well as all embryophytes , better known as land plants . Unlike animal cells , almost every plant cell is surrounded by a polysaccharide cell wall . Neighbouring plant cells are therefore separated by a pair of cell walls and the intervening middle lamella , forming an extracellular domain known as the apoplast . Although cell walls are permeable to small soluble proteins and other solutes , plasmodesmata enable direct , regulated , symplastic transport of substances between cells . There are two forms of plasmodesmata : primary plasmodesmata , which are formed during cell division , and secondary plasmodesmata , which can form between mature cells .

Context: Long John Silver is a cunning and opportunistic pirate who was quartermaster under the notorious Captain Flint . Long John Silver had a pet parrot called Captain Flint , often seen sitting on his shoulder where she would nibble on seeds . Silver claims to have served in the Royal Navy and lost his leg under `` the immortal Hawke '' . `` His left leg was cut off close by the hip , and under the left shoulder , he carried a crutch , which he managed with wonderful dexterity , hopping about upon it like a bird . He was very tall and strong , with a face as big as a ham -- plain and pale , but intelligent and smiling . '' ( Treasure Island ( 1883 ) by Robert Louis Stevenson page 82 ) . He claims to have been the only man whom Flint ever feared . Like many of Stevenson 's characters , there is more than a modicum of duality in the character ; ostensibly Silver is a hardworking and likeable seaman , and it is only as the plot unfolds that his villainous nature is gradually revealed . His relationship with Jim Hawkins , the novel 's protagonist and narrator , is interesting , as he serves as a mentor and eventually father - figure to Jim , creating much shock and emotion when it is discovered that he is in charge of the mutiny , and especially when Jim must confront and fight him later on . Although willing to change sides at any time to further his own interests , Silver has compensating virtues : he is wise enough to pay attention to money management , in contrast to the spendthrift ways of most of the pirates , and is physically courageous despite his disability ; for instance , when Flint 's cache is found to be empty , he coolly stands his ground against five active seamen despite having only Jim , a boy in his teens , to back him .

257,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: There was a lengthy dispute over the leadership of the Senate during June and July 2009 . On June 8 , 2009 , Democrats Hiram Monserrate and Pedro Espada , Jr. , joined the 30 Republican members of the State Senate to attempt to issue a motion to replace current Majority Leader Malcolm Smith with Minority Leader Dean Skelos . Following the precedent of 1913 , the temporary presidency and the majority leadership would have been separated again under this scenario . Since the office of Lieutenant Governor fell vacant after Lt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded to the governorship upon Gov. Eliot Spitzer 's resignation , the majority leaders ( Bruno , Skelos and Smith ) have acted as lieutenant governors . The motions put forward on June 8 also sought to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate , which would have installed him as acting lieutenant governor . The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8 . The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11 , 2009 . The dispute ended July 9 , 2009 , when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader , while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore , and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date . Following the 2010 election and the Republican victory in the Senate , Senator Dean Skelos from Long Island served as both Temporary President and Majority Leader , but resigned in May 2015 in the midst of corruption charges . The current majority leader , or president , is John J. Flanagan .

266,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act , which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773 . Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to `` No taxation without representation '' , that is , to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented . In addition , the well - connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers , who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business . Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies , but in Boston , embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain .

Context: In modern times , the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC . Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate . As many as 60 conspirators , led by Brutus and Cassius , were involved . According to Plutarch , a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March . On his way to the Theatre of Pompey , where he would be assassinated , Caesar passed the seer and joked , `` The Ides of March are come '' , implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled , to which the seer replied `` Aye , Caesar ; but not gone .

New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped - down , energetic social and political critiques . Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave , post-punk and eventually alternative rock . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , electronic rock , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history , including the garage rock / post-punk and synth - pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s .

Context: In population dynamics and population ecology , overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment . The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot . For example , plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off . The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse , a crash or a die - off in which there is a decline in population density . The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot - and - collapse ' .

284,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: Cone cells , or cones , are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes ( e.g. the human eye ) . They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light , as opposed to rod cells , which work better in dim light . Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis , a 0.3 mm diameter rod - free area with very thin , densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina . There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula . The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935 . Oyster 's textbook ( 1999 ) cites work by Curcio et al. ( 1990 ) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina .

Tamago steps in and tries to talk Big Mom into accepting Luffy 's offer in order to replace the ships that were lost after a run - in with Captain Kid . She refuses , saying that pirates do n't make deals and that she will go after Luffy in the new world instead of the Fishman Island . Luffy agrees to a fight with her and says that he will beat her up and claim Fishman Island as his own territory . 572 `` Many Problems Lie Ahead ! A Trap Awaiting in the New World ! '' `` Zento Tanan - Shin Sekai ni Machiukeru Wana '' ( 前途 多 難 新 世界 に 待ち受ける 罠 ) November 11 , 2012 During a check on the palace , the Minister of the Right gets a report that the Tamate Box is gone along with all the treasures and remembers something very important about it . Caribou starts searching for his treasure that he stole from the royal family after realizing it was taken after waking up from getting beat by Luffy . Jimbei and Neptune talk about how Jimbei might join the Straw Hats and putting a new pirate flag in Fishman Island which is the Straw Hat Pirate flag . Later , the Minister of the Right tells King Neptune that the Tamate Box is gone and it might explode in the hands of Luffy if he opens it . However , when Luffy returns , he announces that he gave all the treasure that he recovered to Pekoms and Baron Tamago , along with the tamate box , and tells everyone that he talked back to Big Mom . While Neptune and the Minister of the Right worry about the fate of the Straw Hats , and Nami beats Luffy up for giving away the treasure , Jimbei decides to cut off the alliance with Big Mom before things get ugly . Caribou finds Tamago and Pekoms with his treasure that he stole and attacks Pekoms with his Gatling Gun . Pekoms reveals himself to be a Zoan - type Devil Fruit user . Caribou then attempts to slice off Pekom 's head , saying that he was stronger because he was a logia - type devil fruit eater , only to get punched in the stomach by Pekoms , rendering him unconscious again . Pekoms and Tamago then leave Fishman island . It is later revealed that Smoker and Tashigi were reassigned to the G - 5 Marine Branch , the most ruthless marine branch that do n't even take orders from the HQ , and arrested a bunch of pirates emerging from Fishman Island , who tell Smoker that Luffy beat Hordy , with Smoker replying that he already knows and calls them idiots . 573 `` Finally Time to Go ! Goodbye , Fish - Man Island ! '' `` Tsui ni Shukkō ! Sayonara Gyojin - tō '' ( ついに 出航 ! さよなら 魚 人 島 ) November 18 , 2012 The mermaids and Keimi from the Mermaid Cafe ask Sharley if they can say farewell to the Straw Hats . Sharley says that her prediction that Luffy will destroy Fishman Island might not happen after all since they defeated Hordy and the New Fishman Pirates . However , Keimi fears that Madam Sharley still believes that Luffy will destroy the Fishman Island because she knows that her predictions are always right . Shirahoshi meanwhile is crying and asking the Straw Hats to not go . While Minister of the Right talks to Neptune about mentioning the exploding tamate box to the Straw Hats , Neptune points out that Usopp , Brook , and Chopper complain that they are going to die in the New World and that they should n't tell them more bad news , later having optimistic ideas about how Big Mom might not open it herself or that the explosives might not explode . The Minister of the Left gives Nami a new Log Pose with three needles so they can get to the islands in the New World . He explains that the new log pose takes in the magnetic waves of 3 surrounding islands and that the needle that moves the most is the direction of the most dangerous island . After hearing that , Nami , Chopper , and Usopp tell the Minister of the left to keep it down so Luffy does n't hear , which he evidently does . He then grabs onto Nami wanting to see the new Log Pose and says to go in the direction of the needle that moves the most , stating , `` that 's where the party is '' . Nami insists that she will tell the crew where to go . However , Luffy states that he should decide where they should go , as he is the captain . Franky gets a new haircut and they start to leave but Shirahoshi comes and ask them to pinky promise to come back and they did . The Straw Hats and the fishmen go their separate ways and Luffy remembers the times when Shanks , Rayleigh , Jimbei , and Ace told him something important . The Straw Hats then comment about what they will do once they are in the New World . 574 `` To the New World ! Heading for the Ultimate Sea ! '' `` Shin Sekai e !

Chopper claims he is scared and he wo n't eat the cloud . Meanwhile Luffy , Zoro , Usopp , Franky and Robin are hanging out .

Zoro says he wants to have a drink to celebrate entering the New World . Luffy , Zoro , and Usopp sees three big fish . Zoro wants to eat a fried fish with salt . Usopp wants a fish sliced up and grilled . Luffy wants a fish with mayonnaise . Usopp says which fish Luffy wants and claims that it is not edible . Luffy punches the fish with gear second and Usopp uses the fish hook to grab hold of it . The fish that they caught suddenly got ate by a bigger fish and Zoro uses 360 pound cannon killing it . Nami is still in the bath and she claims that the rest of the crew are making too much of a ruckus and that she should n't have trusted them in watching the ship for her .

Sanji then says that they need to get out of there and asks Nami about what they should do . Nami says they do n't need to do anything and Sanji listened . The Straw Hats asked one of the whales to give them a ride to the surface of the New World . Brook sang a song for the whales so they can bring them to the surface . Before they got to the surface the Straw Hats remembered the times during their training to become stronger so they can regroup and head towards the New World . They finally surfaced and Thousand Sunny hopped off the whales and landed onto the ocean . The Straw Hats say goodbye to the whales and they see some ships claiming they are pirate ships but then they saw that the ships belong to the Marines . 575 `` Z 's Ambition ! Lily the Little Giant !

Context: The name Boötes was first used by Homer in his Odyssey as a celestial reference point for navigation , described as `` late - setting '' or `` slow to set '' , translated as the `` Plowman '' . Exactly whom Boötes is supposed to represent in Greek mythology is not clear . According to one version , he was a son of Demeter , Philomenus , twin brother of Plutus , a ploughman who drove the oxen in the constellation Ursa Major . This is corroborated by the constellation 's name , which itself means `` ox - driver '' or `` herdsman . '' The ancient Greeks saw the asterism now called the `` Big Dipper '' or `` Plough '' as a cart with oxen . This influenced the name 's etymology , derived from the Greek for `` noisy '' or `` ox - driver '' .

322,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: Bromophenol blue is also used as a dye . At neutral pH , the dye absorbs red light most strongly and transmits blue light . Solutions of the dye , therefore , are blue . At low pH , the dye absorbs ultraviolet and blue light most strongly and appears yellow in solution . In solution at pH 3.6 ( in the middle of the transition range of this pH indicator ) obtained by dissolution in water without any pH adjustment , bromophenol blue has a characteristic green red color , where the apparent color shifts depending on the concentration and / or path length through which the solution is observed . This phenomenon is called dichromatic color . Bromophenol blue is the substance with the highest known value of Kreft 's dichromaticity index . This means it has the largest change in color hue , when the thickness or concentration of observed sample increases or decreases .

The isolation of the missions -- the nearest Spanish settlement , San Juan Bautista , Coahuila was over 400 miles ( 644 km ) away -- made it difficult to keep them adequately provisioned . To assist the missionaries , the new governor of Spanish Texas , Martín de Alarcón , wished to establish a way station between the settlements along the Rio Grande and the new missions in East Texas . In April 1718 , Alarcón led an expedition to found a new community in Texas . On May 1 , the group erected a temporary mud , brush , and straw structure near the headwaters of the San Antonio River . This building would serve as a new mission , San Antonio de Valero , named after Saint Anthony of Padua and the viceroy of New Spain , Baltasar de Zúñiga y Guzmán Sotomayor y Sarmiento , Marquess of Valero . The mission , headed by Father Antonio de San Buenaventura y Olivares , was located near a community of Coahuiltecans and was initially populated by three to five Indian converts from Mission San Francisco Solano near San Juan Bautista . One mile ( two km ) north of the mission , Alarcón built a presidio ( fort ) , the Presidio San Antonio de Bexar .

Context: The Prisoners ( Temporary Discharge for Ill Health ) Act , commonly referred to as the Cat and Mouse Act , was an Act of Parliament passed in Britain under Herbert Henry Asquith 's Liberal government in 1913 . Some members of the Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU , commonly referred to as suffragettes ) had been imprisoned for acts of vandalism in support of women 's suffrage . In protest to being imprisoned some of these suffragettes undertook hunger strikes . These suffragettes were then force - fed leading to a public outcry . This act was a response to the outcry ; it allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health . They then had a period of time in which they could recover . After a predetermined period of time the prisoner would be rearrested to serve out the rest of their sentence . Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release . The hunger strikes themselves were now technically legal . However , the Act allowed for the re-imprisonment of the hunger strikers upon their recovery on their original charges . The nickname of the Act came about because of a cat 's habit of playing with its prey ( a mouse ) before finishing it off .

340,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: With OBD II standards , vehicle manufacturers were required to test the exhaust gas recirculation ( EGR ) valve for functionality during driving . Some manufacturers use the MaP sensor to accomplish this . In these vehicles , they have a MAF sensor for their primary load sensor . The MaP sensor is then used for rationality checks and to test the EGR valve . The way they do this is during a deceleration of the vehicle when there is low absolute pressure in the intake manifold ( i.e. , a high vacuum present in the intake manifold relative to the outside air ) the powertrain control module ( PCM ) will open the EGR valve and then monitor the MaP sensor 's values . If the EGR is functioning properly , the manifold absolute pressure will increase as exhaust gases enter .

352,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: James Long believed that the British mercantile community and even the Government unjustly and oppressively treated the Indigo cultivators . His view concurred with Dinabandhu Mitra who expressed his sentiments in a play entitled Nil Darpan ( the original Bengali play was written by him ) and published anonymously from Dhaka in 1860 . Mitra sent Long a copy of the play as early as 1861 . Long brought it to the notice of W. S Seton - Karr , Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission . Seton - Karr , sensing its importance , mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor , Grant. Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends . After the discussion , Seton - Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English . Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long . Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play . When the translation was complete , Seton - Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant 's wish of a few copies . Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel , the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs. 300 . It was published in April or May 1861 . Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor , Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading : `` on her Majesty 's Service '' . The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters . It naturally offended the establishment of the play so much that a razing propaganda was started by the Anglo - Indian Press against the publisher and the translator . One of the leading newspapers named The Englishmen and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer - C.H. Manuel . The words mentioned in Long 's Introduction to the play stated that what was presented in it was `` plain but true '' . This was subsequently used by the planters in their prosecution of Long for publishing defamatory statements .

354,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: A blighted ovum or anembryonic gestation is characterized by a normal - appearing gestational sac , but the absence of an embryo . It likely occurs as a result of early embryonic death with continued development of the trophoblast . When small , the sac can not be distinguished from the early normal pregnancy , as there may be a yolk sac , though a fetal pole is not seen . For diagnosis , the sac must be of sufficient size that the absence of normal embryonic elements is established . The criteria depends on the type of ultrasound exam performed . A pregnancy is anembryonic if a transvaginal ultrasound reveals a sac with a mean gestational sac diameter ( MGD ) greater than 25 mm and no yolk sac , or an MGD > 25 mm with no embryo . Transabdominal imaging without transvaginal scanning may be sufficient for diagnosing early pregnancy failure when an embryo whose crown -- rump length is 15 mm or more has no visible cardiac activity .

In 1773 a ship named The Hector landed in Pictou , Nova Scotia , with 189 settlers , mostly originating from Lochbroom . In 1784 the last barrier to Scottish settlement -- a law restricting land - ownership on Cape Breton Island -- was repealed , and soon both PEI and Nova Scotia were predominantly Gaelic - speaking .

Context: Although large - scale use of wheels did not occur in the Americas prior to European contact , numerous small wheeled artifacts , identified as children 's toys , have been found in Mexican archeological sites , some dating to about 1500 BC . It is thought that the primary obstacle to large - scale development of the wheel in the Americas was the absence of domesticated large animals which could be used to pull wheeled carriages . The closest relative of cattle present in Americas in pre-Columbian times , the American Bison , is difficult to domesticate and was never domesticated by Native Americans ; several horse species existed until about 12,000 years ago , but ultimately became extinct . The only large animal that was domesticated in the Western hemisphere , the llama , did not spread far beyond the Andes by the time of the arrival of Columbus .

Title Directed by Written by Original air date UK viewers ( millions ) `` Episode 1 '' Sandra Goldbacher Sarah Phelps 1 April 2018 ( 2018 - 04 - 01 ) TBD Rachel Argyll falls to the floor , bleeding profusely from a wound to the back of her head caused by a whisky decanter . As her body is being carried off on a stretcher , one of her five adopted children , Jack , is fingerprinted and talks the crime over with his dad , Leo Argyll , at the police station . Jack is later beaten to death in prison and the family buries him . Eighteen months later , Leo Argyll is preparing to marry his secretary , Gwenda Vaughan . This sees the return of son Mickey to the house and the arrival of a strange visitor , Dr Arthur Calgary , who reveals that he gave a lift to Jack at the time that Rachel Argyll was murdered , thus proving belatedly Jack 's innocence . The delay in coming forward is explained away by Calgary being a physicist who has been in the Arctic on a research project . Later , whilst Calgary is sleeping in his hotel room , Mickey Argyll goes to question him and warn him off . At the hotel , Philip Durrant , the husband of Rachel 's eldest adopted daughter , joins Calgary for dinner to propose a plan to make money from Calgary 's revelation by selling the story to the newspapers . Durrant , a former Royal Air Force pilot who was disabled in a car crash , is shown as an abusive husband and a morphine addict . His wife Mary Durrant is also nasty to Tina Argyll and tells Gwenda that she will never replace her mother . `` Episode 2 '' Sandra Goldbacher Sarah Phelps 8 April 2018 ( 2018 - 04 - 08 ) TBD Dr Calgary revisits Sunny Point and is spotted by Hester before Mickey forces him into a car and drives him to a railway station . He assaults Calgary and firmly puts him on a train and tells him to leave . Whilst in motion , Calgary gets the train to stop in the middle of nowhere so he can get off and go back . Over breakfast at Sunny Point , Phillip antagonises everyone and causes many arguments between the siblings . He points out that trying to hide the new found evidence from Calgary , would look suspicious to the police . Calgary later telephones the house with the housemaid , Kirsten , picking up the phone at the same time as Leo Argyll . Calgary informs Argyll that he is going to the police with Kirsten overhearing it all but saying nothing . Whilst Calgary is walking on the road , he is stopped by Bellamy Gould , Chief Constable and friend of Leo Argyll , who is driving a car . Gould questions Calgary 's statement and seems to leave only to turn around and try to run Calgary down . Gould dies in trying , but Calgary survives . Calgary eventually gets a fair hearing form Leo Argyll and stays overnight at the house giving his version of events over dinner . The four remaining Argyll siblings meet later that night in the woods and argue about where they all were on the night of Rachel 's murder and bicker in a display of sibling rivalry with Mary Durrant appearing as the most upset by events and how she feels the other children spoilt her relationship with Rachel . Near the end of the episode , Phillip Durrant is trying to leave the house when he hears footsteps behind him , he turns and says `` of course it 's you ! '' . In the morning , Calgary reveals he wrote a detonation formula for the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , this led him to go mad and be detained against his will at an asylum , not away at the Arctic , as he claimed in the first episode . On the night that Rachel died , he escaped and gave a lift to Jack . At breakfast , Calgary mentions that the shower in the Durrant 's room has been going for some time . Leo Argyll and Calgary go to investigate and find Phillip Durrant dead on the floor of the shower with a hypodermic needle in his arm . `` Episode 3 '' Sandra Goldbacher Sarah Phelps 15 April 2018 ( 2018 - 04 - 15 ) 5.5 million This episode runs over a very short time period but has flashbacks for all the characters and details their reasons for possibly being the killer of Rachel .

When Rachel goes into Leo 's study and discovers women 's underwear on the floor , she goes to the very top floor of the house and catches Leo and Gwenda on the bed . She informs Gwenda that Leo has a habit of sleeping with the staff and that she is not the first . Gwenda retaliates in kind and Rachel smacks her across the face . Rachel tells Leo she is divorcing him and through the conversation , it is understood that the money is in her name and he will be penniless . When she leaves Leo 's study , she is confronted by Mary who is upset that Rachel does not love her . Rachel tells her that she only adopted her because she was sad , and that it was n't Mary 's fault she could not stop her sadness . Jack witnesses this and is aghast , so he confronts his mother and she in turn tells him he is the son of Kirsten , the cook . Jack goes go see Kirsten and through another flashback , Jack is shown in the police station telling Leo that he knows that Leo is his father and that Kirsten is his mother . He tells Leo acidly that he will destroy him and ruin his life .

Rachel dies in Kirsten 's arms and the policeman , Gould , conspires with Leo to have Jack killed in prison . After Phillip is discovered dead , Leo has Calgary taken away to the asylum and Leo is confronted by his children and Kirsten who show him the statuette as the murder weapon , not the decanter that had Jack 's fingerprints on it .

Speaking at the Toronto - based Center for New Religions , Wood said that the freedom of conscience and assembly allowed under such a system has led to a `` remarkable religiosity '' in the United States that is n't present in other industrialized nations . Wood believes that the U.S. operates on `` a sort of civic religion , '' which includes a generally shared belief in a creator who `` expects better of us . '' Beyond that , individuals are free to decide how they want to believe and fill in their own creeds and express their conscience .

453,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: By 2004 , 58 receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) were known , grouped into 20 subfamilies . They play pivotal roles in diverse cellular activities including growth ( by signaling neurotrophins ) , differentiation , metabolism , adhesion , motility , death . RTKs are composed of an extracellular domain , which is able to bind a specific ligand , a transmembrane domain , and an intracellular catalytic domain , which is able to bind and phosphorylate selected substrates . Binding of a ligand to the extracellular region causes a series of structural rearrangements in the RTK that lead to its enzymatic activation . In particular , movement of some parts of the kinase domain gives free access to adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and the substrate to the active site . This triggers a cascade of events through phosphorylation of intracellular proteins that ultimately transmit ( `` transduce '' ) the extracellular signal to the nucleus , causing changes in gene expression . Many RTKs are involved in oncogenesis , either by gene mutation , or chromosome translocation , or simply by over-expression . In every case , the result is a hyper - active kinase , that confers an aberrant , ligand - independent , non-regulated growth stimulus to the cancer cells .

469,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: Before 1986 , people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14 , since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes , and those under that age seldom had substantial income . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction . Before this act , parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported . During the first year of the Tax Reform Act , this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed . The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents . In 1988 , the threshold was lowered to 2 years old , and in 1990 , the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old . Today , an SSN is required regardless of the child 's age to receive an exemption . Since then , parents have often applied for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth ; today , it can be done on the application for a birth certificate .

495,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: However , it is possible to narrow the date further . A terminus ante quem for A Shrew seems to be August 1592 , as a stage direction at 3.21 mentions `` Simon , '' which probably refers to the actor Simon Jewell , who was buried on 21 August 1592 . Furthermore , The Shrew must have been written earlier than 1593 , as Anthony Chute 's Beauty Dishonoured , written under the title of Shore 's wife ( published in June 1593 ) contains the line `` He calls his Kate , and she must come and kiss him . '' This must refer to The Shrew , as there is no corresponding `` kissing scene '' in A Shrew . There are also verbal similarities between both Shrew plays and the anonymous play A Knack to Know a Knave ( first performed at The Rose on 10 June 1592 ) . Knack features several passages common to both A Shrew and The Shrew , but it also borrows several passages unique to The Shrew . This suggests The Shrew was on stage prior to June 1592 .

Roland Moreno patented the memory card concept in 1974 . An important patent for smart cards with a microprocessor and memory as used today was filed by Jürgen Dethloff in 1976 and granted as USP 4105156 in 1978 . In 1977 , Michel Ugon from Honeywell Bull invented the first microprocessor smart card with two chips : one microprocessor and one memory , and in 1978 , he patented the self - programmable one - chip microcomputer ( SPOM ) that defines the necessary architecture to program the chip . Three years later , Motorola used this patent in its `` CP8 '' . At that time , Bull had 1,200 patents related to smart cards . In 2001 , Bull sold its CP8 division together with its patents to Schlumberger , who subsequently combined its own internal smart card department and CP8 to create Axalto . In 2006 , Axalto and Gemplus , at the time the world 's top two smart - card manufacturers , merged and became Gemalto . In 2008 , Dexa Systems spun off from Schlumberger and acquired Enterprise Security Services business , which included the smart - card solutions division responsible for deploying the first large - scale smart - card management systems based on public key infrastructure ( PKI ) .

574,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: In the United States , a continuing resolution ( often abbreviated to CR ) is a type of appropriations legislation . An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates ( gives to , sets aside for ) money to specific federal government departments , agencies , and programs . The money provides funding for operations , personnel , equipment , and activities . Regular appropriations bills are passed annually , with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year . The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government , which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year . When Congress and the president fail to agree on and pass one or more of the regular appropriations bills , a continuing resolution can be passed instead . A continuing resolution continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year ( or with minor modifications ) for a set amount of time . Continuing resolutions typically provide funding at a rate or formula based on the previous year 's funding . The funding extends until a specific date or regular appropriations bills are passed , whichever comes first . There can be some changes to some of the accounts in a continuing resolution . The continuing resolution takes the form of a joint resolution , and may provide bridging funding for existing federal programs at current , reduced , or expanded levels .

This was the Macedonian form of the Athenian Φερενίκη , Phereníkē , or Φερονίκη , Pheroníkē , from φέρειν , phérein , to bring , and νίκη , níkê , `` victory '' , i.e. `` she who brings victory '' . The Ancient Macedonian form of the name was popularized because of its extensive use as a royal feminine name by the reigning dynasties of the states of the Diadochi of Alexander the Great throughout the Eastern Mediterranean during the Hellenistic age , most notably by the Ptolemies of Egypt and by the Seleucids of Asia . In medieval etymology , Veronica was sometimes wrongly supposed to derive from Latin vera ( true ) and Greek eikon ( image ) . Its popularity in medieval and modern times is based mainly on the importance in Christianity of Saint Veronica and her Veil of Veronica . Pet forms of Veronica include Ronnie and Roni and the German Frony . In Russian , the pet form is Nika ( Ника ) . `` Veronica '' is a popular name in many countries in the Mediterranean , Eastern Europe , and Latin America , as well as southern Ireland , France , and French - speaking Canada .

583,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: Battle Abbey was founded by William at the site of the battle . According to 12th - century sources , William made a vow to found the abbey , and the high altar of the church was placed at the site where Harold had died . More likely , the foundation was imposed on William by papal legates in 1070 . The topography of the battlefield has been altered by subsequent construction work for the abbey , and the slope defended by the English is now much less steep than it was at the time of the battle ; the top of the ridge has also been built up and levelled . After the Dissolution of the Monasteries , the abbey 's lands passed to secular landowners , who used it as a residence or country house .

Context: Conscription in the United States , commonly known as the draft , has been employed by the federal government of the United States in five conflicts : the American Revolution , the American Civil War , World War I , World War II , and the Cold War ( including both the Korean War and the Vietnam War ) . The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act . It was the country 's first peacetime draft . From 1940 until 1973 , during both peacetime and periods of conflict , men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means . The draft came to an end when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all - volunteer military force . However , the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan ; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed . United States Federal Law also provides for the compulsory conscription of men between the ages of 17 and 45 and certain women for militia service pursuant to Article I , Section 8 of the United States Constitution and 10 U.S. Code § 246 .

614,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: Tim Allen as Mike Baxter : Mike is a father of three daughters and the director of marketing for the Outdoor Man chain of sporting goods stores . He fervently supports traditional American values , is a Protestant , and is politically conservative . Mike loves his daughters but says his favorite is Eve , the youngest and most athletic daughter , and whose political opinions and interests mirror his own . He is proud of her ability to excel at anything she tries , including school work , hunting , and playing sports . Mike often finds himself annoyed with Outdoor Man 's young slow - witted employee Kyle , and with Ryan , his politically liberal son - in - law and the father of Mike 's grandson Boyd . The video blog or `` vlog '' that Mike does for Outdoor Man is frequently used as a vehicle to rant about his political views . Mike is a graduate of the University of Michigan , and an amateur radio operator using the call sign KA0XTT . Nancy Travis as Vanessa Baxter , Mike 's wife : Vanessa is a geologist working in the energy industry for a company that does hydraulic fracturing , or `` fracking '' . In season four , Vanessa becomes frustrated with her job and decides to become a high school science teacher . Vanessa was ambiguous in her political views until season five , when she announces she is supporting Hillary Clinton for president , mainly because she thinks it will advance women 's causes . She is also shown drinking wine frequently , and nearly as frequently mocked by Mike and her daughters about it . She is a graduate of Ohio State University . Vanessa has a tendency to put her foot in her mouth when around people of other races . Despite this , she and her African - American neighbor Carol Larabee seem to get along . Vanessa 's humor tends to include bad puns , which irritate Mike and the girls to no end . Amanda Fuller ( seasons 2 -- 6 ) and Alexandra Krosney ( season 1 ) as Kristin Beth Baxter , the oldest daughter : Kristin , unlike her father , espouses more liberal beliefs . During her senior year of high school , Kristin became pregnant with her son , Boyd . She was a single mother living in the Baxter home until moving out in the season two finale . She began to reconcile with Boyd 's father , Ryan , in season three , and the two get married between seasons four and five . Kristin worked at a diner until landing a job at an upscale restaurant run by a former co-worker at the end of season two . In season four , she becomes the manager of the new restaurant opened by Outdoor Man . Kristin tends to work extra hard in this new job to prove she did not get the position through nepotism , despite Mike and Ed frequently telling her she was qualified . Alexandra Krosney portrayed Kristin in the show 's first season ( despite being nearly two years younger than Molly Ephraim , playing Kristin 's younger sister ) ; Krosney was replaced by Amanda Fuller prior to season two for unspecified creative reasons . Molly Ephraim as Amanda Elaine `` Mandy '' Baxter - Anderson , the middle daughter : Mandy is nowhere near as intelligent as her sisters ( though her penchant for cutting class and ignoring homework might label her as voluntarily dumb ) , but excels in social situations . Interested in fashion ( and little else ) , she was one of the most popular girls at her high school . Mandy is very confident and creative , demonstrating traits found in her father . Unlike the rest of the family , she is lazy , conceited , selfish , insulting , and delinquent -- she drinks underage , ignores all driving laws , shoplifts from Outdoor Man , and has been caught staying out all night -- but occasionally displays moments of generosity and caring . She started dating Kyle in season 2 . As of season three , she is attending a local college and working at the diner where Kristin used to work . Later that same season , she begins an online clothing business , selling her self - designed fashions which she assembles in the basement of her parents ' house . Kyle asks her to marry him in season 5 , the 100th episode . She marries Kyle in season six , but they have yet to move out of the Baxter home . Up until she turned 21 , a running gag on the show was Mike , Vanessa , and occasionally Kristin snatching glasses of alcohol out of Mandy 's hand , usually followed by Mandy making a lame excuse . Kaitlyn Dever as Eve Baxter , the youngest daughter : Eve is an intelligent , athletic tomboy and generally has the same interests as Mike , including camping , sports , guns , and the military . She is Mike 's favorite daughter , and excels at her hobbies . She frequently outplays the boys in soccer and makes the boys ' football team as their placekicker . She is well aware of being the favorite over her two sisters . Eve has also inherited her father 's sense of humor , and her trademark sarcastic wit is frequently directed at clueless sister Mandy . Eve is an excellent student , whose only weak subject is art , though she did have to change math classes to escape a prejudiced teacher . Eve is a member of Army Junior ROTC and works toward gaining admittance to West Point . Her attempt to do so is unsuccessful , which seriously depresses her , so in season six , Eve decides to take a `` personal year '' rather than immediately attend college . She spends some of this time singing and playing guitar for money , but this proves to be unfruitful . During her gap year , Eve applies to the Air Force Academy in nearby Colorado Springs , and is accepted . Christoph Sanders as Kyle Anderson , a young employee at Outdoor Man : Kyle is universally recognized as a good guy . Kyle idolizes Mike , having grown up without a father figure . Kyle takes care of his grandmother who has dementia , and it is implied he grew up in her home . Kyle is often oblivious to social cues and is slow to catch on to the events happening around him . Kyle dated Kristin in season one and started dating Mandy in season two before proposing in season five , and marrying Mandy in season six . Héctor Elizondo as Edward `` Ed '' Alzate , Mike 's longtime boss : Ed started a bait and tackle shop many years ago and hired Mike , who helped turn the shop into the 20 - store Outdoor Man chain . Ed is perhaps fifteen years older than Mike , but the two men bond over similar outdoor hobbies and shared conservative values . Mike regularly talks to Ed about the happenings in his home and occasionally seeks advice . Having been divorced four times , Ed 's suggestions are rarely helpful . Ed is a Vietnam veteran , although he saw no combat in Vietnam , stating that he was a clerk in Saigon . He continues to help fellow veterans at the local Veterans of Foreign Wars hall with their Veteran Affairs paperwork . Ed is also a recurring target for jokes about his age and lack of hair , most often from Mike . It is revealed in season 6 that Ed has early onset dementia . Flynn Morrison ( regular , seasons 2 -- 6 ) and Evan and Luke Kruntchev ( recurring , season 1 ) as Boyd Baxter , Kristin 's son : Mike enjoys spending quality time with his grandson Boyd , and affectionately views him as the son he never had . Mike and Ryan often clash on how he should be raised . Boyd enjoys activities encouraged by both his father and grandfather . Jordan Masterson ( regular , seasons 2 -- 6 ) and Nick Jonas ( guest star , season 1 ) as Ryan Vogelson , Boyd 's Canadian father : Though Ryan initially fled when Kristin got pregnant , he returned to be involved in Boyd 's upbringing , and eventually the two reconciled and got engaged ( at the end of season 3 ) . Ryan holds liberal views , both politically and philosophically , and he and Mike routinely clash over their fundamentally opposing values , especially when it comes to child - rearing . Ryan wishes to raise his son without religion and patriotism , but neither Mike nor Kristin agree with this . His vegan diet , views on discipline , and what Mike sees as his oversensitivity are an affront to Mike 's beliefs , but Ryan generally enjoys being a thorn in Mike 's side . On rare occasions , Ryan and Mike agree on what is best for Boyd , but this usually puts them at odds with Kristin and / or Vanessa . Jonathan Adams as Chuck Larabee ( regular , seasons 4 -- 6 ; recurring , seasons 2 -- 3 ) , Mike and Vanessa 's neighbor : Chuck is a retired U.S. Marine and a veteran of the first Gulf War who runs a private security business and later takes charge of security for the Denver Outdoor Man . Chuck is an African - American , and often jokes with Mike about racial stereotypes , and they regularly exchange barbs as if they do n't like each other . In reality , they are good friends , despite being unwilling to admit it . Vanessa sees through their heated exchanges , often telling them to `` get a room '' . Chuck is married to Carol ( but the two do not always agree politically ) and they have a son , Brandon , who is the same age as Eve .

Context: In geology , uniformitarianism has included the gradualistic concept that `` the present is the key to the past '' ( that events occur at the same rate now as they have always done ) ; many geologists now , however , no longer hold to a strict theory of gradualism . Coined by William Whewell , the word was proposed in contrast to catastrophism by British naturalists in the late 18th century , starting with the work of the geologist James Hutton . Hutton 's work was later refined by scientist John Playfair and popularised by geologist Charles Lyell 's Principles of Geology in 1830 .

638,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: All of these processing events result in an antigen - binding region that is highly variable , even when the same gene segments are recombined . V ( D ) J recombination allows for the generation of immunoglobulins and T cell receptors to antigens that neither the organism nor its ancestor ( s ) need to have previously encountered , allowing for an adaptive immune response to novel pathogens that develop or to those that frequently change ( e.g. , seasonal influenza ) . However , a major caveat to this process is that the DNA sequence must remain in - frame in order to maintain the correct amino acid sequence in the final protein product . If the resulting sequence is out - of - frame , the development of the cell will be arrested , and the cell will not survive to maturity . V ( D ) J recombination is therefore a very costly process that must be ( and is ) strictly regulated and controlled .

Context: Unlike passive transport , which uses the kinetic energy and natural entropy of molecules moving down a gradient , active transport uses cellular energy to move them against a gradient , polar repulsion , or other resistance . Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs , such as ions , glucose and amino acids . If the process uses chemical energy , such as from adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , it is termed primary active transport . Secondary active transport involves the use of an electrochemical gradient . Examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose in the intestines in humans and the uptake of mineral ions into root hair cells of plants .

668,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: Sympathetic nervous system stimulation causes vasoconstriction of most blood vessels , including many of those in the skin , the digestive tract , and the kidneys . This occurs as a result of activation of alpha - 1 adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine released by post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons . These receptors exist throughout the vasculature of the body but are inhibited and counterbalanced by beta - 2 adrenergic receptors ( stimulated by epinephrine release from the adrenal glands ) in the skeletal muscles , the heart , the lungs , and the brain during a sympathoadrenal response .

Context: The fight - or - flight response ( also called hyperarousal , or the acute stress response ) is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived harmful event , attack , or threat to survival . It was first described by Walter Bradford Cannon . His theory states that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system , preparing the animal for fighting or fleeing . More specifically , the adrenal medulla produces a hormonal cascade that results in the secretion of catecholamines , especially norepinephrine and epinephrine . The hormones estrogen , testosterone , and cortisol , as well as the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin , also affect how organisms react to stress .

744,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: This mechanism is carried out without utilisation of metabolic energy . Here , only the roots act as an organ of absorption or passage . Hence , sometimes it is called water absorption ' through roots ' , rather ' by ' roots . It occurs in rapidly transpiring plants during the daytime , because of the opening of stomata and the atmospheric conditions . The force for absorption of water is created at the leaf end i.e. the transpiration pull . The main cause behind this transpiration pull , water is lifted up in the plant axis like a bucket of water is lifted by a person from a well . Transpiration pull is responsible for dragging water at the leaf end , the pull or force is transmitted down to the root through column of water in the xylem elements . The continuity of the water column remains intact due to the cohesion between the molecules and it act as a rope . Roots simply act as a passive organ of absorption . As transpiration proceeds , water absorption occurs simultaneously to compensate the water loss from the leaf end . Most volume of water entering plants is by means of passive absorption . Passive transport is no different from diffusion , it requires no input of energy : there is free movement of molecules from their higher concentration to their lower concentration . The water will enter the plant via the root cells that can be found in the roots where mainly passive absorption occurs . Also , with the absorption of water , minerals and nutrients are also absorbed .

Wargrave is accused of influencing the jury to hand a guilty verdict to Edward Seton , a man many thought was innocent of his crime of killing an old woman , and sentencing him to death unfairly . However , as the two policemen discuss at Scotland Yard , new evidence after Seton 's execution proved he was unmistakably guilty . He admits in his postscript that he has a lifelong hidden sadistic urge to cause death , but felt bound only to indulge it with guilty persons , and a lifelong wish to create a masterpiece of a mystery . Finding himself terminally ill , he creates a game in which , as island owner `` U.N. Owen '' ( i.e. , `` Unknown '' ) , he entices to an island various people who have been responsible for the deaths of other people , but escaped justice , through a third party agent , Isaac Morris , in order to be a murderer himself , and kill his `` guests '' in a way that would leave an almost - unsolvable mystery . After the deaths , he arranges the island so that each death appears to have a survivor . However out of what he admits is a `` pitiful human need '' for recognition , he also writes a confession , which he throws in the sea , and leaves to chance whether it will be found . His final act is to shoot himself in a way that matches the description of his death in some of the other guests ' diaries , by using a rubber cord and handkerchief wrapped around the gun when he shoots himself in the head ; the elastic will separate and attract no attention , and the gun and cloth will recoil a sufficient distance from him to avoid any suspicion of the true circumstances by the police .

Despite the warm tropical summer weather , some incongruences such as decorations with themes of winter and snow are not uncommon . In some cities like Guarapuava , there are decoration contests , when judges go to houses to look at the decorations , inside or outside of the house , and decide the most beautiful house .

During this phase , the cell copies its DNA in preparation for mitosis . Interphase is the ' daily living ' or metabolic phase of the cell , in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them , grows , reads its DNA , and conducts other `` normal '' cell functions . The majority of eukaryotic cells spend most of their time in interphase . This phase was formerly called the resting phase . However , interphase does not describe a cell that is merely resting ; rather , the cell is living , and preparing for later cell division , so the name was changed .

The lanterns were displayed to send a warning to Charlestown patriots across the Charles River about the movements of the British Army . Revere and William Dawes would later deliver the same message to Lexington themselves , but this lantern method was a fast way to inform the back - up riders in Charlestown about the movements of the British ; these back - up riders planned to deliver the warning message to Lexington and Concord in case Revere and Dawes were arrested on the way .

Context: In the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II , the Chicago Cubs are depicted as the 2015 World Series champions , defeating a fictional American League team from Miami ( the Miami Marlins had not yet been formed ) , whose mascot is an alligator . Screenwriter Bob Gale , who co-wrote the script of Back to the Future Part II , originally intended it as a joke , saying `` Being a baseball fan , I thought , ' OK , let 's come up with one of the most unlikely scenarios we can think of ' '' , referencing both the Cubs ' long championship drought , and the fact that Florida did not have a baseball team in 1989 . He also explained the October 21 prediction was based on the postseason structure at the time , and thus could have been accurate had MLB not added the Division Series in 1994 ( but not played until 1995 due to the strike ) and the Wild Card Game in 2012 . Had the predicted schedule held , Chicago would have swept the Miami team in the World Series with the Series starting October 17th . In the actual 2015 postseason , the Cubs advanced to the National League Championship Series , but were eliminated in four games . Coincidentally , the final game of the NLCS took place on October 21 , the same date as the fictional events of Back to the Future Part II .

Context: The 2011 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tōhoku ( 東北 地方 太平洋 沖 地震 , Tōhoku - chihō Taiheiyō Oki Jishin ) was a magnitude 9.0 -- 9.1 ( M ) undersea megathrust earthquake off the coast of Japan that occurred at 14 : 46 JST ( 05 : 46 UTC ) on Friday 11 March 2011 , with the epicentre approximately 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) east of the Oshika Peninsula of Tōhoku and the hypocenter at an underwater depth of approximately 29 km ( 18 mi ) . The earthquake is often referred to in Japan as the Great East Japan Earthquake ( 東日本 大震災 , Higashi nihon daishinsai ) and is also known as the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake , and the 3.11 earthquake . It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan , and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record - keeping began in 1900 . The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that reached heights of up to 40.5 metres ( 133 ft ) in Miyako in Tōhoku 's Iwate Prefecture , and which , in the Sendai area , traveled up to 10 km ( 6 mi ) inland . The earthquake moved Honshu ( the main island of Japan ) 2.4 m ( 8 ft ) east , shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 cm ( 4 in ) and 25 cm ( 10 in ) , increased earth 's rotational speed by 1.8 μs per day , and generated infrasound waves detected in perturbations of the low - orbiting GOCE satellite . Initially , the earthquake caused sinking of part of Honshu 's Pacific coast by up to roughly a metre , but after about three years , the coast rose back and kept on rising to exceed the original height of the coast .

Uchū ichi Budō - kai ! ! '' ( や ろう ぜ 全 王様 ! 宇宙 一 武道 会 ! ! ) February 5 , 2017 TBA The Present Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō are playing a game together in their realm , but both have become bored with their monotonous routine . Meanwhile , Goku heads to a local farmer 's market to sell his produce and get Chi - Chi off his back about making money . On the way home , he is ambushed by some robbers . Goku defeats them , but he is injured in the process . Deciding that he has grown rusty , Goku and Goten decide to train with Whis . They head to the Capsule Corporation building , where Bulma reveals she is pregnant with her and Vegeta 's second child . Goten remains behind to train with Trunks . Vegeta declines to accompany Goku so that he can be with Bulma when she gives birth . Goku heads to Beerus ' planet alone . While training with Whis , Goku remembers Grand Zenō 's intention to hold a multiverse martial arts tournament . Heedless of Beerus and Whis ' warnings , Goku uses Grand Zenō 's button to head to his realm and convinces Present Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to hold the tournament . When he returns to Beerus ' planet , Beerus angrily berates Goku and explains that Grand Zenō naive and innocent nature combined with his extreme power makes him a danger to the multiverse . Beerus threatens to kill Goku if he steps out of line again . Goku , Beerus , and Whis head to the Sacred World of the Kais , where the Grand Minister arrives . He tells the group to assemble their ten most powerful warriors to compete in the `` Tournament of Power '' ( 力 の 大会 , Chikara no Taikai ) . 78 `` The Gods of Every Universe in Shock ? ! Losers Erased in the Tournament of Power '' `` Zen uchū no kami - sama mo don hiki ! ? Maketara shōmetsu `` Chikara no taikai '' '' ( 全 宇宙 の 神様 も ドン 引き ! ? 負け たら 消滅 「 力 の 大会 」 ) February 12 , 2017 TBA The Grand Minister explains the details of the `` Tournament of Power '' and states that it will be held on `` the World of Void '' . It is a place of `` infinite nothingness '' , where the competitors can fight without limits . The tournament champion will be granted a wish by the Super Dragon Balls , while the losers and their respective universes will be completely erased from existence . Everyone is horrified by this harsh penalty . Goku suggests asking Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to ignore it , but Whis advises against this . Whis tells Goku that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō has already made up his mind and attempting to change it could be dangerous . Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to hold the tournament in the first place . Goku declares that he will defeat any opponent he faces . The Grand Minister also reveals that Universes 7 and 9 are to have a smaller exhibition tournament for Future Grand Zenō 's benefit . Each universe is to name three fighters . Goku sets off to recruit teammates . After Vegeta refuses , Goku recruits Gohan and Majin Buu , who is accompanied by Mr. Satan to represent Universe 7 . Goku also explains the potential penalty to Gohan . Gohan tells Goku to keep the stakes a secret to prevent mass panic . Back at Grand Zenō 's and Future Grand Zenō 's palace , all the gods from all 12 universes gather . The Grand Minister explains the purpose of the Zen Exhibition Match . He alludes to the possibility of Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō erasing the fighters that he deems unfit for the tournament . In the first round , Majin Buu is to fight Basil ( バジル , Bajiru ) , a humanoid canine fighter from Universe 9 . 79 `` Universe 9 's Basil the Kicker VS Universe 7 's Majin Buu ! ! '' `` Dai kyu uchū keri no Bajiru basasu Dai nana uchū Majinbū ! ! '' ( 第 9 宇宙 蹴り の バジル VS 第 7 宇宙 魔 人 ブウ ! ! ) February 19 , 2017 TBA Basil quickly gains the upper hand and beats down Majin Buu , who is not taking the fight seriously and thinks of it as a game . Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu 's attention , which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack . As Roh ( ロウ , Rō ) , the Supreme Kai of Universe 9 , claims victory , Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach , but he is otherwise unmoved . Basil and Roh are shocked to see this . Mr. Satan is injured during the attack . He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious . This enrages Majin Buu to the point , where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring . However , since neither Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō is satisfied with the fight , Basil is allowed to get back into the ring . Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful . Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating , Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue . The Grand Minister announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along . Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him , which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9 . However , Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil . This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory . As the Universe 9 team laments Basil 's loss , Basil 's second oldest brother Lavender ( ラベンダ , Rabenda ) says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent , which Bergamo gives him permission to do , he can win his match . Gohan volunteers to fight Lavender . 80 `` Awaken Your Sleeping Battle Spirit ! Son Gohan 's Fight ! ! '' `` Nemutta tōshi o yobisamase ! Son Gohan no tatakai ! ! '' ( 眠っ た 闘志 を 呼び覚ませ ! 孫 悟 飯 の 闘い ! ! ) February 26 , 2017 TBA As their battle begins , Lavender spits a poison mist into Gohan 's eyes and blinds him . Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison , but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone . Unable to see , Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows . Lavender counters by levitating , which eliminates the sound of his footsteps . Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender 's body , which uses it as a kind of active radar . Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan 's body . Lavender mounts a comeback . In desperation , Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack . He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed . Lavender is knocked out , but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he can not continue . With both fighters down , the match is declared a tie . After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean , the Grand Minister announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well . However , Universes 1 , 5 , 8 , and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong . Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō had long believed that there were too many universes . He was planning to erase most of them anyway , but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared . With the announcement concluded , the ring is repaired in preparation for the final exhibition match where Goku will fight Bergamo ( ベルガモ , Berugamo ) , Basil 's oldest brother who is also a humanoid canine . 81 5 `` Bergamo the Crusher Vs Son Goku ! Which One Wields the Limitless Power ? ! '' `` Tsubushi no Berugamo VS Son Gokū ! Aotenjō no tsuyosa wa dotchida ! ? '' ( 潰し の ベルガモ VS 孫悟空 ! 青 天井 の 強 さ は どっち だ ! ? ) March 5 , 2017 TBA Before their battle begins , Bergamo denounces Goku before the assembled gods . Bergamo pleads with Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to rescind the rule that the universes that lose the Tournament of Power be erased . Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō agree on the condition that Bergamo beats Goku in an all out battle . Grand Minister states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure , Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō will immediately erase all of the universes . Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms . When the fight begins , Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed . Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times , but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku 's attacks . He grows stronger and physically larger . Goku continues to attack , which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight . Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue , which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha . Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure , but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge . The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin . The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner . Suddenly , a mysterious fighter from Universe 11 named Toppo ( トッポ ) appears and challenges Goku to a battle . Goku , who is unsatisfied after his short fight with Bergamo , agrees to fight Toppo . 82 6 `` Never Forgive Son Goku ! Toppo the Warrior of Justice Intrudes ! ! '' `` Son Gokū yurusumaji ! Seigi no senshi Toppo ran'nyū ! ! ! '' ( 孫悟空 許す まじ ! 正義 の 戦士 トッポ 乱入 ! ! ) March 19 , 2017 TBA After obtaining Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō blessing to proceed , Goku and Toppo begin their battle . Toppo quickly gains the upper hand and dislocates Goku 's shoulder . Goku responds by attacking with a flurry of blows , but Toppo manages to grab Goku in a powerful bear hug . He begins squeezing the life out of Goku , which forces Goku to turn Super Saiyan Blue to escape . Goku gains the upper hand in this form and damages Toppo with a Kamehameha . Just as the two power up even more , the Grand Minister puts an end to the fight . As Toppo leaves , he reveals to Goku that Universe 11 has a warrior even stronger than him named Jiren ( ジレン ) . The Grand Minister begins creating a martial arts arena suitable for the Tournament of Power . In the Sacred World of the Kais , Beerus and Goku get into an argument over Goku 's constant relaxed and negligent attitude , which Whis breaks up . The group agrees to convene at the Capsule Corporation to discuss their future strategy . 83 7 `` Form the Universe 7 Representing Team ! Who are the Strongest Ten ? ! '' `` Dai - 7 uchū daihyō chīmu o kessei seyo ! Saikyō no 10 - ri wa dareda ? '' ( 第 7 宇宙 代表 チーム を 結成 せよ ! 最強 の 10 人 は 誰 だ ! ? ) March 26 , 2017 TBA Goku and the others arrive at Capsule Corporation . They discuss who should be on the team . Goku immediately suggests Monaka , but Beerus tells him that Monaka is sick and can not participate . Goku and Gohan agree on Vegeta , Piccolo , Krillin , Master Roshi , No. 18 , and No. 17 , which would bring the total number of fighters up to nine . Trunks and Goten are ruled out due to their inexperience . They proceed to ask Vegeta , who has been thinking of a name for his second child . Vegeta refuses to participate . He says he will not fight , while Bulma is pregnant . Whis uses his time warping ability to birth the baby sooner than expected in order to get Vegeta to agree to the fight . Everyone celebrates the baby 's birth . Trunks is slightly disappointed he has a sister because he wanted to train with a younger brother . As soon as the baby is handed to Vegeta , he develops an attachment to her . Bulma names the baby Bulla even though Vegeta hoped to give her the Saiyan name Eschalot . However , Vegeta quickly accepts Bulla 's name . Goku leaves to recruit members and heads to Krillin 's house . 84 8 `` Son Goku the Recruiter Invites Krillin and No. 18 '' `` Sukautoman Son Gokū -- Kuririn to 18 - gō o izanau '' ( スカウト マン 孫悟空 クリリン と 18 号 を 誘う ) April 2 , 2017 TBA Goku and Gohan arrive at Krillin 's house and ask him and No. 18 to join the Tournament of Power . No. 18 convinces Krillin to participate in order to put his newfound martial arts training to use . No. 18 is reluctant to join herself . She quickly suspects Goku and Gohan of hiding something from them , but Goku convinces her that the secret is a 10 million Zeni reward , which convinces her to participate . Gohan decides to test Krillin in a sparring match on the coast . After Gohan overpowers him in hand to hand combat , Krillin swiftly defeats Gohan by blinding him with his new move named Solar Flare x 100 and knocking him into the sea . Goku is excited by Krillin 's new power . He challenges him to a sparring match as well . They relocate to a building owned by Mr. Satan , where Krillin 's strategies make up for the gap in power , forcing Goku to go Super Saiyan . Goku then transforms into his Super Saiyan Blue form , and he and Krillin have a Kamehameha clash . As Goku increases his power and starts to overpower Krillin , No. 18 intervenes and blocks Goku 's Kamehameha , just as Krillin collapses from exhaustion . She justifies herself by noting that the Tournament of Power will be a battle royal and that Goku can not expect to fight one - on - one all the time . Goku concedes the match and realizes he will have to adjust his tactics in order to win the Tournament of Power . No. 18 reveals that No. 17 is currently working at a wildlife reserve , but she does not know where . Goku decides to ask Dende to find No. 17 . 85 9 `` The Universes Begin to Make Their Moves Their Individual Motives '' `` Ugokidasu uchū -- sorezore no omowaku '' ( 動き出す 宇宙 -- それぞれ の 思惑 ) April 9 , 2017 TBA Gohan leaves to recruit Piccolo , while Goku prepares to head to the Lookout . He encounters Majin Buu and Mr. Satan training . Goku discovers that Buu has lost weight and has gotten much slimmer in appearance . The two spar together . Buu defeats Goku by overwhelming him with ki blasts and knocking him out of the fighting stage . Meanwhile , Khai ( カイ ) , the Supreme Kai of Universe 11 , gathers all of the Supreme Kais involved in the tournament except for Universe 7 's , who is ostracized due to Goku 's involvement with the creation of the tournament . Khai asks his fellow Supreme Kais to request that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō cancel the erasure of the universes , but they are all too afraid of his wrath to do so . Champa gathers all the Gods of Destruction involved in the tournament except Beerus after finding out about the Supreme Kai 's meeting , and they discuss Goku . Toppo recruits his fellow Pride Troopers Kahseral ( カーセラル , Kāseraru ) and Dyspo ( ディスポ , Disupo ) . Champa recruits Cabba and demands he find more powerful Saiyans . Goku meets Dende and Mr. Popo at the Lookout and learns No. 17 's location . Gohan prepares to train with Piccolo . 86 10 `` Fist Cross for the First Time ! Android # 17 VS Son Goku ! !

Dende also reveals that Kid Buu has reincarnated as a young Earthling with massive fighting potential and asks Goku to train him when he is old enough . They reach the island as Goku arrives just in time to witness No. 17 defeat a group of armed poachers . As they introduce themselves to each other , a large army of poachers arrive . Goku and No. 17 team up to subdue them all . Afterwards , No. 17 explains that the poachers are after the last Minotaurus in order to steal its rare and valuable horns . The two decide to have a sparring match . No. 17 evenly matches Super Saiyan Goku , which causes him to turn Super Saiyan Blue . Goku launches a Kamehameha at No. 17 , who easily deflects it with an energy shield . The two go toe - to - toe until No. 17 ends the match in order to avoid catching the island in the crossfire . Goku and No. 17 acknowledge that they were both holding back in the fight . Afterwards , Goku attempts to convince him to join the Tournament of Power , but No. 17 is uninterested . He remains indifferent even when Goku reveals that the losing universes will be erased . Meanwhile , alien poachers arrive on Earth and they set their sights on the Minotaurus . 87 11 `` Hunt the Poachers ! Goku and No. 17 's United Front ! ! '' `` Mitsuryō - dan o kare !

884,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Thomas Edison . While other inventors had produced devices that could record sounds , Edison 's phonograph was the first to be able to reproduce the recorded sound . His phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder . A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages . Later improvements through the years included modifications to the turntable and its drive system , the stylus or needle , and the sound and equalization systems .

886,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: Tyrion Lannister ( season 1 -- present ) portrayed by Peter Dinklage . Nicknamed `` The Imp '' or `` Halfman '' , Tyrion Lannister of House Lannister is the younger brother of Cersei and Jaime Lannister . He is a dwarf ; and his mother died during his birth , for which his father , Tywin Lannister , blames him . While not physically powerful , Tyrion has a cunning mind and often uses to his advantage the fact that others constantly underestimate him . In Season Three , Tyrion is given the job of Master of Coin , a role that he is unprepared and inexperienced for . Tyrion is commanded by his father to marry Sansa Stark ; however , on the wedding night , Tyrion refuses to consummate his marriage and instead lets Sansa sleep alone , promising not to touch her unless she wanted him to . The death of her brother Robb , in which Tyrion took no part , causes a further rift between the couple and between Tyrion and his father , who he claims ca n't distinguish between his interests and his often - praised ideal of devotion to family . Tywin bitterly claims that he had wanted to drown Tyrion upon birth , but stayed himself for the sake of duty . In season 4 , Tyrion welcomes Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne to King 's Landing for Joffrey 's wedding to Margaery Tyrell , though Oberyn implies to Tyrion that his true purpose is to seek vengeance for his sister , who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane on Tywin 's orders . When Joffrey is fatally poisoned , Tyrion is framed and arrested . Tyrion , however , implies that Cersei knows of his innocence and just wants him dead . At Tyrion 's trial , he demands a trial by combat . Tyrion is approached by Oberyn , who volunteers to be his champion in order to fight Cersei 's champion , Ser Gregor Clegane . When Oberyn loses the fight and is killed , Tyrion is sentenced to death . Jaime , however , frees Tyrion and arranges for him to escape King 's Landing . Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae , who testified against him and is now Tywin 's lover . After a brief struggle , Tyrion strangles Shae to death , and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey 's crossbow . Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys . They arrive in Pentos , where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne . Tyrion is bound and gagged by Jorah Mormont , who says that he will take him to Daenerys . Daenerys takes them both to her home in the Great Pyramid of Meereen and asks Tyrion why he is here . Tyrion tells her everything , including Varys ' plan . He initially counsels her to stay in Meereen , but Daenerys makes it plain to him that her eyes are still on Westeros . Tyrion tells Daenerys how hard it will be to win the love of both the common people and the nobles . He later joins her at the opening celebrations of Daznak 's Pit , where Jorah unexpectedly reappears to defeat every other foe on the arena . As the Sons of the Harpy attack , Tyrion manages to survive by fleeing to the midst of the arena , where they are rescued by Drogon , while Daenerys is spirited away on his back . In season 6 , Tyrion struggles to maintain peace in Meereen , particularly when the Sons of the Harpy burn the entire Meereenese Navy , stranding them in Slaver 's Bay . Following an alliance with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , Tyrion advises Daenerys to break up with Daario so that she may pursue a marriage alliance in Westeros . In gratitude for Tyrion 's loyalty , Daenerys names him her official Hand , and he accompanies her back to Westeros . In season 7 Tyrion 's advice to Daenerys often conflicts with her views , and he has mixed success in directing her actions . He sneaks into King 's Landing and meets with Jamie to set up a meeting between Cersei and Daenerys , which eventually happens in the Dragonpit outside the city . At the meeting a captured wight is produced to convince Cersei that the worst threat is from beyond the Wall . When Cersei is not convinced , Tyrion risks execution to meet with his sister to try again to persuade her . He is unexpectedly allowed to leave Cersei 's presence alive , and thinks he has secured an agreement from her to help with the fight against the Wight Walkers .

Context: The lac gene and its derivatives are amenable to use as a reporter gene in a number of bacterial - based selection techniques such as two hybrid analysis , in which the successful binding of a transcriptional activator to a specific promoter sequence must be determined . In LB plates containing X-gal , the colour change from white colonies to a shade of blue corresponds to about 20 - 100 β - galactosidase units , while tetrazolium lactose and MacConkey lactose media have a range of 100 - 1000 units , being most sensitive in the high and low parts of this range respectively . Since MacConkey lactose and tetrazolium lactose media both rely on the products of lactose breakdown , they require the presence of both lacZ and lacY genes .

914,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: Since the late 1970s , the use of CFCs has been heavily regulated because of their destructive effects on the ozone layer . After the development of his electron capture detector , James Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air , finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC - 11 over Ireland . In a self - funded research expedition ending in 1973 , Lovelock went on to measure CFC - 11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic , finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected , and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment . The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere . The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who , after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock 's work , embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974 . It turns out that one of CFCs ' most attractive features -- their low reactivity -- is key to their most destructive effects . CFCs ' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years , giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere . Once in the stratosphere , the sun 's ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the C - Cl bond .

Context: A typical explanation found in the scientific literature for the evolution of light hair is related to the evolution of light skin , and in turn the requirement for vitamin D synthesis and northern Europe 's seasonal less solar radiation . Lighter skin is due to a low concentration in pigmentation , thus allowing more sunlight to trigger the production of vitamin D. In this way , high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation , which reduces the prevalence of rickets caused by vitamin D deficiency . The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the Inuit is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in , because in the polar climate there is more ice or snow on the ground , and this reflects the solar radiation onto the skin , making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond , brown or red hair , light skin and blue , grey or green eyes .

997,"Using the provided context, answer the question with as few words as possible. Context: The peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) is one of the two components of the nervous system , the other part is the central nervous system ( CNS ) . The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic .
