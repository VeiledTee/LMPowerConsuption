4,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if there's a Line of Duty Series 4. I'm not super familiar with the show but I know it's a British police procedural drama. Let me think about what I remember.I recall that Line of Duty is popular and has been around for several seasons. The first few series were on BBC One right? Then after Series 3 or maybe Series 4 there was some change in the network. Wait wasn't there a point where it moved to another channel?Oh yeah I think after Series 4 they switched from BBC One to ITV. So that would mean that Series 4 does exist because they continued making more series after moving networks. But wait did they actually produce a Series 4 before moving? Or was the move after Series 3?Let me try to remember any specific episodes or promotions around that time. I think Series 4 had some big cases and maybe some character departures or introductions. Also the ratings were good so it makes sense for them to continue.Another way to check is by looking up the number of series released. If Series 4 exists then the answer would be true. But since I can't look it up right now I have to rely on my memory. From what I remember there are multiple series beyond 4 so yes Series 4 must exist.So putting it all together: Line of Duty has Series 1 through at least Series 5 or more which means Series 4 definitely exists.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,22.346482100023422,0.00724944645319189,0.0021285867459596187,0.0,0.0,0.0
12,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""Pokémon Let's Go Eevee"" is a spin-off. Hmm let me think about what I know regarding Pokémon games and their classifications.First I remember that the main series of Pokémon games follows a specific pattern usually releasing two versions each generation with different starter Pokémon. For example in Generation I there was Red and Blue (or Green in Japan) then Gold and Silver Ruby and Sapphire etc. These are considered the core or mainline titles.Now ""Pokémon Let's Go Eevee"" is part of a series called the ""Let's Go"" collection. From what I recall these games were released for the Nintendo Switch and were remakes of older Pokémon games. Specifically they're based on the original Pokémon Yellow version but updated with modern features like HD graphics and new mechanics such as co-op play.Since it's a remake rather than an entirely new mainline game it might be considered a spin-off. Spin-offs usually refer to games that branch off from the main series often featuring different gameplay styles or focusing on specific aspects of the Pokémon universe. The ""Let's Go"" series introduces elements like co-op play and simplified catching mechanics which are different from the traditional turn-based battles in the main games.Additionally these titles don't introduce new regions or significantly expand upon the lore beyond what was already established in previous games. They're more about revisiting classic content with a fresh take. This further supports the idea that they're spin-offs rather than part of the main series.I also think about other spin-off Pokémon games like ""Pokémon Mystery Dungeon "" ""Pokémon Rumble "" or ""Pokémon Conquest."" These are clearly different from the main RPGs and are categorized as spin-offs because they offer unique gameplay experiences. Similarly the ""Let's Go"" games diverge in their approach making them fit into the spin-off category.Therefore considering all these points it makes sense to classify ""Pokémon Let's Go Eevee"" as a spin-off of the main Pokémon series.</think>True",True,False,0,0.0,25.707319100009045,0.00849370981975574,0.0024939280899714472,0.0,0.0,0.0
17,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the Netherlands is part of the United Kingdom. Hmm let's start by recalling what each country entails.The United Kingdom often abbreviated as the UK consists of four countries: England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland. These are all located in the British Isles. The UK is a sovereign state with its own government currency (the pound sterling) and capital in London.On the other hand the Netherlands is a country in Northwestern Europe. It's known for its tulips windmills and being part of the Low Countries along with Belgium and Luxembourg. The Netherlands has its own government currency (the euro as part of the Eurozone) and capital in Amsterdam.I remember that the UK and the Netherlands are both members of the European Union but they're separate countries. The Netherlands isn't one of the four constituent parts of the UK. They have different languages too; Dutch is spoken in the Netherlands while English is predominant in the UK.Also historically the two countries have had their own distinct histories and political developments. For example the UK has a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system whereas the Netherlands also has a constitutional monarchy but with its own unique governmental structure.So putting it all together the Netherlands isn't part of the United Kingdom. They are neighboring countries in Europe but maintain their independence.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,31.4562380000134,0.010572124991575026,0.0031041935793300196,0.0,0.0,0.0
7,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the days get longer and shorter at the equator. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about day length and how it varies around the world.I remember that the Earth is tilted on its axis which causes seasons and variations in daylight hours. At higher latitudes like near the poles there are extreme changes where days can be very long or very short depending on the time of year. For example during summer places above the Arctic Circle experience midnight sun meaning it's daylight all day. Conversely in winter they have polar nights with no sunlight.But what about the equator? The equator is at 0 degrees latitude and receives roughly equal amounts of daylight throughout the year because it's directly under the Sun's path. I think that near the equator the length of day and night doesn't change much. Unlike places further north or south there isn't a significant variation in the number of hours of sunlight each day.Wait but does that mean the days are always exactly 12 hours long? Or is there some slight variation? I think there might be minor changes due to factors like atmospheric refraction and the Sun's angular diameter which can cause sunrise and sunset times to vary a bit. However these variations are minimal compared to higher latitudes.So putting it all together while there might be tiny fluctuations in day length at the equator they don't experience significant seasonal changes where days get much longer or shorter like other regions do. Therefore the answer should be that days don't get significantly longer or shorter at the equator.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,36.672916600015014,0.012469363407601937,0.0036612618427285587,0.0,0.0,0.0
3,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if there's ever been a Duke of Sussex before. Hmm I remember hearing about the British royal family and some titles they hold. The Duke of Sussex is currently Prince Harry right? But was there someone else with that title before him?I think titles in the British nobility can be inherited or created anew by the monarch. So maybe before Prince Harry someone else held the title. Let me try to recall any historical figures. I know that the Dukedom of Sussex might have been around for a while.Wait wasn't there an earlier Duke of Sussex? Maybe in the 18th or 19th century? I think it was created before Prince Harry's time. There was a man named Henry who was a grandson of King George III. He was known as the Duke of Sussex and he lived in the early 1800s. So that would mean there was indeed a previous Duke of Sussex.So putting it all together yes there has been at least one other Duke of Sussex before Prince Harry. Therefore the answer should be True.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,39.141001999989385,0.013358579867354727,0.0039223541044260775,0.0,0.0,0.0
11,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if there's a Season 2 of ""Case Histories."" First I remember that ""Case Histories"" was a British TV series based on the books by Val McDermid. The main character is Dr. Tony Hill played by David Morrissey. The show ran for several seasons but I'm not exactly sure how many.I think Season 1 came out in 2014. Then there were more seasons after that. Let me try to recall the order. After Season 1 there was a Season 2 right? Because each season corresponds to a book in the series. The first book is ""The Mermaid's Purse "" which was Season 1. The second book is ""The Red House "" so that would be Season 2.Wait but I'm not entirely certain if they made a Season 2 or if it stopped after the first season. Maybe I should check my memory about how many seasons were produced. I think there are at least three seasons because I remember watching up to Season 3. So yes Season 2 definitely exists.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,44.35386470000958,0.01526349503264218,0.00448167641947305,0.0,0.0,0.0
13,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" was written specifically for the movie Top Gun. Let me start by recalling what I know about both the song and the movie.Top Gun came out in 1986 right? It's a big hit with Tom Cruise as Maverick. The soundtrack is iconic too featuring songs like ""Danger Zone"" by Kenny Loggins. But wait that's just one song. There's another track called ""Highway to the Danger Zone."" I think that was also part of the movie.Now who wrote ""Highway to the Danger Zone""? I believe it's by Harold Faltermeyer and Steve Stevens. They were involved in creating the music for Top Gun. So maybe they wrote this song specifically for the film. But I'm not entirely sure if it was written just for that or if it existed before.I should check when the song was released. If it came out around 1986 then it's likely made for the movie. Alternatively sometimes songs are used in movies but weren't originally created for them. For example ""Danger Zone"" was written specifically for Top Gun so maybe this one too.Wait I think ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" is actually a re-recorded version of another song called ""Highway Star"" by Deep Purple. But that doesn't make sense because it's a different genre. Maybe it's an instrumental track or something else entirely.No wait again. Harold Faltermeyer did compose some tracks for Top Gun including the main theme and other instrumental pieces. So perhaps ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" is one of those original compositions made just for the movie. That would make sense because the song fits well with the action scenes in Top Gun.I'm leaning towards yes it was written specifically for Top Gun. But I should double-check if there's any information about it being used elsewhere before the movie came out. If not then it's probably original to the film.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,52.79792230002931,0.018334101611035377,0.005383269735187022,0.0,0.0,0.0
1,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether anyone has climbed the North Face of Everest. Hmm I remember that Mount Everest is the highest peak in the world and it's located on the border between Nepal and China. The North Face would be the side facing towards China specifically Tibet.I think about the first successful ascent of Everest. That was by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 right? But I believe they took the South Col route from the Nepalese side. So that's not the North Face.Wait there are other routes on Everest besides the South Col. The North Face is known to be more technically challenging because of its steepness and harsh weather conditions. I think it's called the ""North Ridge"" or something similar. Maybe the first ascent via the North Face was done by a Chinese team? Let me try to recall.I remember that in 1960 there was an attempt by a Chinese expedition. They claimed to have reached the summit from the North Face but I think there were some doubts because they didn't provide much evidence at the time. Then in 1975 another Chinese team went up and successfully summited via the North Face providing more concrete proof.So yes people have climbed the North Face of Everest specifically by Chinese climbers in 1960 and again in 1975. There might be other ascents since then as well. Therefore the answer should be True.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,54.42771229997743,0.018941417696439585,0.005561590242600426,0.0,0.0,0.0
10,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the Central Bank of India is a nationalized bank. Let me start by recalling what I know about banks in India. There are public sector banks private banks and foreign banks. Nationalized banks fall under the public sector category.The Central Bank of India was established in 1913 which is quite early compared to other banks. I remember that many Indian banks were nationalized in the mid-20th century. The first major wave of nationalization happened in 1956 when the government took over several private banks. Then there was another round in 1980 where more banks were nationalized.I think the Central Bank of India was one of those that were nationalized during this period. But I'm not entirely sure which specific year it was. Maybe it was part of the 1956 or 1980 nationalization drives. Alternatively perhaps it's a public sector bank but wasn't nationalized from the start.Wait another thought: some banks were started as private entities and later nationalized while others were established by the government from the beginning. The Central Bank of India was founded in 1913 by Indian industrialists like Sir Ratan Tata so it started as a private bank. Then during the nationalization drives especially in 1956 or 1980 many such banks were taken over.I think the Central Bank of India was nationalized in 1956 along with other major banks. That would make it a nationalized bank under public sector ownership. So yes it's a nationalized bank.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,63.61349560000235,0.022298365370753703,0.006547259199887343,0.0,0.0,0.0
16,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Salt Lake City is the biggest city in Utah. Let me start by recalling what I know about Utah's geography and cities.I remember that Utah is a state in the western United States known for its natural beauty like the Great Salt Lake and the Wasatch Mountains. The capital of Utah is Salt Lake City which I think is also one of the larger cities there. But is it the biggest?I'm trying to recall if there are other major cities in Utah that might be bigger. There's Provo which has a significant population because of Brigham Young University. Then there's Ogden and maybe some others like West Valley City or Sandy. Wait I think West Valley City is actually part of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area but is it larger than Salt Lake itself?I should probably look up the population numbers to be sure. From what I remember Salt Lake City has a population around 200 000 people. But when considering the metropolitan area it's much bigger including cities like West Valley and Sandy. However the question is about the city proper not the metro area.Wait no actually I think Provo might have a larger population than Salt Lake City. Or maybe not? Let me think again. Salt Lake City is the capital and a major hub so it's likely to be the most populous city in Utah. But I'm not entirely certain because sometimes smaller cities can grow faster.Another angle: looking at the order of cities by population in Utah. The top cities are probably Salt Lake City then maybe West Valley City Provo Ogden and Sandy. So if Salt Lake City is first it would be the biggest. But I'm not 100% sure without checking.Wait I think I might have confused some numbers before. Let me try to visualize a list of Utah cities by population. Salt Lake City is definitely up there. West Valley City is part of the same metro area but might have a slightly smaller population than SLC. Provo has a decent size because of BYU but maybe not as big as SLC.So putting it all together I think Salt Lake City is indeed the biggest city in Utah by population.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,69.31519749999279,0.024379039782576738,0.007158188048629143,0.0,0.0,0.0

She's known for her dedication and positive attitude. At some point in the series she decides to run for city council. I think the season where she runs is around Season 4 or 5. I'm not entirely sure about the exact season number but I recall that her campaign was a significant storyline. She faces some challenges during her campaign like fundraising and dealing with opposition from other candidates.Leslie's character is portrayed as very competent and well-liked in the community so it makes sense that she would win. However I also remember that there were some twists in the show where things didn't always go as planned for her. But in this case since running for office was a major plot point I think she must have succeeded to move the story forward.I don't recall any specific episode where she loses the election. Instead I think after winning she takes on more responsibilities and continues to make positive changes in Pawnee. So putting it all together I believe Leslie Knope does win the city council election.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,78.34252150001703,0.027669680927697286,0.008124388043682417,0.0,0.0,0.0
2,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Air Force One flies with a fighter escort. Let me start by recalling what I know about Air Force One. It's the plane that carries the President of the United States right? So it's a highly secure and important aircraft.I remember hearing that when the President travels there are often other planes accompanying him for security reasons. But wait is that always fighter jets or just some kind of escort? I think sometimes they have other military planes around to provide protection. Maybe fighter jets are part of that escort?I should consider why a fighter escort would be necessary. Fighter jets can intercept any potential threats like other aircraft that might approach too closely. They can also provide a visual deterrent showing that the President's plane is well-protected.But I'm not entirely sure if it's always the case. Maybe it depends on the situation or the level of threat perceived during the flight. For example when traveling to certain regions with higher security risks they might have more escorts than usual.I also wonder about the logistics. Fighter jets have different fuel capacities and ranges compared to Air Force One. So if the President is traveling a long distance would the fighter jets need to refuel or rotate? That could complicate things but I guess they have plans in place for that.Another thought: sometimes when high-profile individuals travel especially internationally other countries might provide their own escorts as part of the protocol. But Air Force One itself probably has its own escort regardless of where it's going.I should also think about past incidents or news reports. I recall hearing about fighter jets accompanying Air Force One during certain events or trips but I'm not sure if that's standard procedure every time.Wait maybe it's more common for the President to have an escort when flying over areas with potential threats like conflict zones or regions with known hostile activity. But even in peacetime having a fighter escort could be a routine security measure.I think the answer is yes Air Force One does fly with fighter escorts especially during international trips or when there's a perceived need for enhanced security. However I'm not 100% certain if it happens every single flight or only under specific circumstances.To sum up based on what I know and have thought through I believe that Air Force One does typically fly with fighter escorts to ensure the President's safety during travel.</think>True,True,False,0,0.0,79.79069910000544,0.028193339352368823,0.008278144939379627,0.0,0.0,0.0
18,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Johnson & Wales University is a for-profit school. Let me start by recalling what I know about the institution. Johnson & Wales is known for its programs in hospitality culinary arts business and other related fields. They have multiple campuses across the United States.I think most universities are either non-profit or for-profit. Non-profit schools typically include public universities funded by states and private universities that rely on donations and tuition. For-profit institutions often market themselves more aggressively and may be listed in stock exchanges.Johnson & Wales from what I remember is a private university. Private universities can be either non-profit or for-profit. To determine which category Johnson & Wales falls into I should check if it's part of a publicly traded company or if it operates with the intention of making profits for shareholders.I recall that some well-known for-profit schools include institutions like the University of Phoenix or DeVry University. These are often listed on stock exchanges and their primary goal is to generate profit. On the other hand non-profit universities reinvest any surplus funds back into the institution rather than distributing them as profits.Looking up Johnson & Wales I find that it's actually a private non-profit university. It was established in 1914 and has grown into a multi-campus institution. The focus is on education without the primary motive of generating profit for shareholders. Therefore it doesn't fit the definition of a for-profit school.So putting it all together Johnson & Wales University is not a for-profit school; it's a non-profit educational institution.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,89.06138349999674,0.0315749259780901,0.009271048400119775,0.0,0.0,0.0

Glenn is a main character who's been around since the early seasons. He was part of the group that started at the farm and then moved to Woodbury. I remember that in Season 4 there was a big battle with the Governor and some characters died. But I think Glenn survived that. Then in Season 5 they were at the prison and there was a lot going on with the Savior's attack. I don't recall Glenn dying then either.Season 6 starts after the events of the prison being overrun by the Saviors. The group is split up and some are at Hilltop while others are at the Kingdom. I think in Season 6 there's an episode where Glenn goes with a group to the Kingdom to try to make peace or something. Wait wasn't there a big battle between the Hilltop and the Saviors? I believe that was in Season 7 not 6. So maybe in Season 6 things are still building up. But then again I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact timeline.I think Glenn does die but I'm trying to remember when. Was it in Season 6 or later? Maybe in Season 8? Or was it earlier? Let me try to piece this together. In Season 6 there's an episode called ""Here's Not Here "" which is the mid-season finale. I think that's where a lot of action happens. There's a scene where Glenn is with Abraham and they're trying to get supplies or something. Then in the next episode maybe he dies? Or does he survive until later?Wait no I think he actually dies in Season 6. The death was pretty impactful because it was unexpected. He was killed by a walker while he was tied up right?

8,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the UEFA Champions League final is just one game. Let me think about this step by step.First I remember that the Champions League is a big football tournament involving top clubs from Europe. The structure of the competition usually starts with group stages where teams play multiple matches against each other. Then there are knockout rounds which include the round of 16 quarterfinals semifinals and finally the final.Wait in the knockout stages do they have single matches or two-legged ties? I think for most rounds like the round of 16 and quarterfinals teams play home and away games. That means each tie consists of two matches: one at each team's home stadium. The winner is determined by aggregate goals over both legs.But what about the semifinals and the final? I'm pretty sure that in the semifinals they also have two-legged ties. So each semifinal match has a first leg and a second leg. Then comes the final. Now does the final follow the same pattern or is it different?I recall watching the Champions League finals before and they seem to be single matches. There's usually one game where the two teams face off at a designated venue often in front of a large crowd. The winner of that match becomes the champion.Wait but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there was a time when the final had two legs? Or perhaps it's always been a single game. Let me think about recent years. In 2023 for example Manchester City won against Inter Milan in a single final match. Similarly previous finals like Chelsea vs. Manchester City in 2021 were also one-off games.So putting this together: the Champions League final is indeed just one game.

However after Derek's death Meredith became a single parent to Henry.But then later on Meredith started dating another character Jackson Avery. They got married as well but I don't recall them having any children together. So does that mean Meredith only has one child Henry?Wait no there was also a storyline where Meredith had a miscarriage with Derek before they were married. That was a really emotional episode.

I recall that in 1982 Italy won against West Germany and it wasn't on penalties. Then in 1986 Argentina beat England with a goal from Maradona. Wait maybe in the 1990s? There was a final between Germany and Argentina in 1990 where Germany won 1-0 in extra time so no penalties there. Then in 1994 Brazil won against Italy but that was also decided by a goal in extra time not penalties. Oh! I think the first World Cup final to go to penalties was in 2018 between France and Croatia.

6,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the dog from ""The Little Rascals"" is still alive. First I should clarify which specific dog they're referring to because there have been multiple versions of ""The Little Rascals."" The original series was in the 1920s and 30s and then there were remakes in later decades.In the classic series the main dog character is named Pete. I think Pete was played by a few different dogs over the years because well dogs don't live forever. So if we're talking about the original Pete from the black-and-white shorts those dogs are definitely not alive anymore since they were active in the 1920s and 30s.Then there's the 1994 movie version of ""The Little Rascals."" In that film the dog was named Pops played by a dog named Cooper. I believe Cooper passed away a while back too. So if someone is asking about the dog from the movie he isn't alive either.Wait but maybe they're referring to another version or a different character? Let me think. There's also ""The New Little Rascals"" which started in 2013. In that series the dog is named Pete again played by a dog named Max. I'm not sure about Max's current status. Maybe he's still alive but I don't have specific information on that.So depending on which version they're asking about the answer could vary. But generally most of the dogs who played Pete or Pops in the various ""Little Rascals"" productions are no longer alive because their lifespans wouldn't extend beyond a couple of decades at most.I should also consider if there's any confusion with other characters or if someone is mixing up different shows. For example sometimes people confuse ""The Little Rascals"" with ""Our Gang "" which had similar themes but different characters and dogs. But in this case the question specifically mentions ""Little Rascals.""In summary unless it's a very recent production where the dog is still young the answer would likely be that the dog from ""The Little Rascals"" is not alive anymore.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,123.38923629999044,0.044111742518952946,0.012952115871644914,0.0,0.0,0.0
20,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Melaleuca and Tea Tree are the same thing. Let me start by breaking down what each term refers to.First Melaleuca. I know that's a genus of plants right? It's part of the myrtle family Myrtaceae. There are many species in this genus like Melaleuca alternifolia and others. They're native to Australia if I'm not mistaken. These plants are known for their essential oils which have various uses.Now Tea Tree. That term is often associated with the essential oil that's popular for its medicinal properties. From what I remember Tea Tree oil comes from a specific species of Melaleuca. Wait isn't it Melaleuca alternifolia? So in that case Tea Tree would be a common name for that particular species within the Melaleuca genus.So putting this together: Melaleuca is the genus and Tea Tree refers to a specific species within that genus. Therefore they aren't exactly the same thing because one is a broader category (genus) and the other is a specific plant within that category. However in common usage people might refer to Melaleuca alternifolia as Tea Tree so there's some overlap.I should also consider if there are any other species called Tea Tree or if it's exclusively Melaleuca alternifolia. I think the term Tea Tree is most commonly associated with that one species used for its essential oil. So in a general sense when someone says Tea Tree they're talking about Melaleuca alternifolia.But strictly speaking Melaleuca as a genus includes many more plants beyond just the Tea Tree. Therefore they aren't exactly the same thing. The answer would be False because while they are related they refer to different taxonomic levels—one is a genus and the other is a specific species within that genus.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,105.96338289996493,0.038571658463341506,0.011325433121669637,0.0,0.0,0.0
21,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether there will be new episodes of Black Mirror. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. Black Mirror is a British science fiction anthology series that explores themes related to modern society and technology. It's known for its thought-provoking storylines and often dystopian take on future tech.I remember that the show has had several seasons so far. The first season was in 2011 followed by more seasons in subsequent years. I think the last season released before this year was Season 5 which came out in 2020. Since then there hasn't been an official announcement of a new season but that doesn't necessarily mean it's over.I should check if there have been any recent news or announcements from Netflix or the creators about a new season. Maybe some interviews where they've hinted at continuing the series. I also recall that sometimes shows take breaks between seasons for various reasons like production schedules or creative decisions.Another angle is to look into the contracts of the main cast and crew. If their contracts are up it might indicate whether there's potential for more episodes. However since Black Mirror is an anthology series each episode can have different directors and writers so maybe they don't need the same recurring cast as other shows.I should also consider the popularity of the show. Black Mirror has a strong fan base and has been quite successful which usually increases the likelihood of续订。But sometimes even popular shows get canceled if ratings dip or if the creative team decides to move on.Wait I think there was some buzz in 2023 about possible new episodes. Maybe Netflix is planning something? Or perhaps they're working on a movie instead. It's also possible that they're taking their time to develop more episodes with high-quality scripts which could delay the release but doesn't mean it's stopping.I should verify if there are any official statements from Netflix or Charlie Brooker the creator. If I can find a reliable source confirming production on new episodes that would be definitive. Otherwise it might just be rumors and speculation.In summary while there hasn't been an official confirmation of new episodes as of my last update in 2023 there are possibilities that Netflix is planning more content for Black Mirror. The show's popularity and the nature of its anthology format could mean that new episodes will eventually come out but it might take some time.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,110.56630599999335,0.04025764635073992,0.011820473880179493,0.0,0.0,0.0
23,"<think>Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether it's possible for someone to have twins with two different fathers. Hmm that sounds a bit complicated but let me break it down.First I know that twins usually come from the same mother and father because they develop from either one fertilized egg splitting (identical twins) or two separate eggs being fertilized by the same sperm (fraternal twins). But wait can there be cases where each twin has a different biological father?I remember hearing about something called heteropaternal superfecundation. Is that real? From what I recall it's when a woman releases multiple eggs and each is fertilized by sperm from different fathers. So if she has sex with two different men around the same time both could potentially fertilize separate eggs.But how common is this? I think it's pretty rare because timing needs to be just right for both fertilizations to happen. Also medical testing would need to confirm that each twin has a different father. I've heard of cases where DNA tests showed twins had different fathers so it must be possible.Wait but isn't there another term for this? Maybe ""double paternity"" or something like that. Yeah I think that's the case when two different men are the biological fathers of twins. So in summary yes it is possible through heteropaternal superfecundation where each twin has a different father.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,109.33433260000311,0.039830005895561335,0.011694909837351303,0.0,0.0,0.0
22,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether you can get a rash from using a hot tub. Hmm let's think about this step by step.First I know that hot tubs are filled with water and often have chemicals like chlorine or bromine to keep them clean. But sometimes people might not maintain the chemical levels properly. If there's too much chlorine it could irritate the skin especially if someone is sensitive to it. That might cause a rash.Also hot tubs can be breeding grounds for bacteria if they're not cleaned regularly. There are certain types of bacteria that thrive in warm water like pseudomonas which can cause something called ""hot tub folliculitis."" This condition leads to small red bumps or rashes on the skin where hair follicles are affected.Another thing is that hot tubs might have other microorganisms if they're not treated correctly. For example Legionella bacteria can grow in warm water and cause Legionnaires' disease which has symptoms like fever cough and sometimes a rash. But I'm not sure how common that is compared to just getting a regular skin irritation.Additionally some people might have allergies or sensitivities to the chemicals used in hot tubs. Even if the levels are within normal range someone could still develop an allergic reaction leading to a rash.There's also the possibility of improper pH levels in the water. If the pH is too high or too low it can cause skin irritation and rashes because it disrupts the natural protective barrier of the skin.I should consider how long someone stays in the hot tub as well. Prolonged exposure to hot water can dry out the skin making it more susceptible to irritation and rashes. The heat might also cause sweating which combined with the chemicals could lead to breakouts or rashes.Moreover sharing a hot tub with others increases the risk of spreading infections that can cause rashes. If someone else has an infection and uses the same water it's possible to contract it through contact.I've heard about people getting ""pruney"" fingers from soaking too long but that's different from a rash. However if the skin is already irritated or sensitive the prolonged exposure might exacerbate it into a full-blown rash.Another angle is the use of certain skincare products before entering the hot tub. If someone uses lotions or soaps that don't mix well with the chemicals in the water they could develop a reaction leading to a rash.I should also think about the temperature of the water. Extremely hot water can cause burns but even moderately high temperatures might irritate sensitive skin leading to redness and rashes.In summary considering all these factors—chemical irritation bacterial infections allergies improper pH levels prolonged exposure shared use skincare product interactions and water temperature—it seems plausible that using a hot tub could indeed cause a rash. There are multiple pathways through which this can happen so the answer is likely true.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,117.6200955999957,0.04284336655207243,0.012579694571697683,0.0,0.0,0.0
24,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Thousand Island dressing is the same as French dressing. Hmm let me think about this. I remember that both are types of salad dressings but I'm not exactly sure if they're identical or different.First what do I know about Thousand Island dressing? It's usually a mix of mayonnaise ketchup and some other ingredients like relish or pickles. It has a bright red color because of the ketchup and it's pretty thick. People often use it on salads like wedge salads with iceberg lettuce.Now French dressing. I think that's different. From what I recall French dressing is made with oil and vinegar maybe some herbs or spices. It's more of a vinaigrette style which is lighter than Thousand Island. It doesn't have the same chunky texture because it's usually just mixed together without adding things like relish.Wait but sometimes people might confuse them because both are used on salads. But no they taste quite different. Thousand Island has that tangy sweet flavor from ketchup and maybe a bit of sugar or honey while French dressing is more acidic with the vinegar and oil base.I should also consider if there's any overlap in their ingredients. Thousand Island uses mayo and ketchup as bases whereas French relies on oil and vinegar. So they don't share those main components. Maybe some recipes add herbs to both but that doesn't make them the same.So putting it all together I think they're different dressings. They have distinct flavors textures and base ingredients. Therefore Thousand Island is not the same as French dressing.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,118.3180083000043,0.043105989624443154,0.01265680611319826,0.0,0.0,0.0
25,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether liquid nitrogen and dry ice are the same thing. Hmm let's start by recalling what each of these substances is.Liquid nitrogen is a substance that's commonly used in various applications like cryogenics or preserving food. It's nitrogen gas (N₂) that has been cooled down to its liquid state at very low temperatures. I remember it's extremely cold and can cause frostbite if handled improperly.Dry ice on the other hand is something I've heard about being used for fog effects in parties or haunted houses. From what I know dry ice isn't actually ice; it's solid carbon dioxide (CO₂). When it sublimates meaning it turns directly from solid to gas without passing through a liquid phase it creates that cool fog effect.So comparing the two: liquid nitrogen is N₂ in its liquid form while dry ice is CO₂ in its solid state. They're both used for cooling purposes but serve different functions and have different chemical compositions. Liquid nitrogen boils at around -196°C (-320°F) whereas dry ice sublimates at about -78.5°C (-109.3°F). Another point is their physical states: liquid nitrogen is a liquid while dry ice is a solid. They're used in different contexts too; liquid nitrogen for things that require extremely low temperatures and dry ice for creating fog or keeping things cold without melting into water.I don't think they can be interchanged because of these differences. So the answer should be False.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,115.48345459997654,0.042085695931509286,0.012357226876936848,0.0,0.0,0.0
26,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Fred from First Dates has a partner. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. First Dates is a reality TV series where people go on blind dates and then decide whether to see each other again based on their interactions.Fred is one of the regulars on the show right? He's known for being quite picky and sometimes comes off as a bit of a tough judge. I remember seeing him in several episodes but I'm not sure about his personal life outside the show. The question is specifically asking if he has a partner.I think Fred was single when he started appearing on First Dates. But TV personalities often have their lives change over time. Maybe he found someone through the show or elsewhere. However as far as I know there hasn't been any official announcement about him being in a relationship while he's been on the show. Also since it's a dating show participants are usually looking for relationships but that doesn't necessarily mean they have one.I should also consider if Fred has ever mentioned having a partner during his appearances. From what I recall he hasn't talked about a current partner. He might have had past relationships but the question is about whether he currently has one.Another angle: sometimes shows update their cast members' statuses. If Fred were in a relationship it might be mentioned on the show or in press releases. But I don't remember any such updates. So putting this together it seems that Fred from First Dates does not have a partner.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,114.99512650002725,0.04190764174625422,0.012304946501980812,0.0,0.0,0.0
27,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether breakfast lunch and dinner are always served in Italy. Hmm let's start by thinking about what a typical day looks like in Italy. From what I know Italian meals can vary depending on the region and the type of establishment.First breakfast. In many parts of Italy especially in cities you can find places that serve breakfast often with coffee and pastries. But is it always available everywhere? Maybe not. For example some smaller towns or family-run restaurants might not have a dedicated breakfast menu. They might open later focusing more on lunch and dinner.Next lunch. Lunch is usually a big meal in Italy especially for families. Most restaurants will serve lunch but again timing can vary. Some places might close during the afternoon after serving lunch reopening for dinner. So while lunch is common it's not always available all day or at every restaurant.Dinner is another main meal. In cities and tourist areas dinners are typically served in the evening. However some restaurants might have limited hours especially on weekdays when people eat earlier. Also during summer months dinner times can be later than usual. So while dinner is a staple it's not always available at all times or everywhere.Additionally considering different regions like the north versus the south meal times and availability can differ. For instance in southern Italy lunch might be served earlier and dinner could be later compared to northern regions.So putting this together while breakfast lunch and dinner are common meals in Italy they aren't always available everywhere at all times. It depends on the location type of restaurant and time of day. Therefore the answer would be False.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,116.83739590001642,0.042590755624179875,0.012505522801967608,0.0,0.0,0.0
28,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Scar is alive in The Lion King 2. Let me start by recalling what I know about the movies.In The Lion King Scar is the main antagonist who kills Mufasa and takes over as king. He's eventually defeated by Simba and I remember a scene where he falls off a cliff into a stampede of wildebeests. That should have killed him right? But wait in some stories characters don't always die even if it looks like they do.Now The Lion King 2 is set years later. Simba is now the king and his son Kovu is growing up. I'm trying to remember if Scar appears in this movie. I think he doesn't show up as a character because he was already defeated in the first movie. But maybe there's some mention of him or a flashback?Wait could it be that Scar is alive in some way? Maybe he survived the fall and is hiding somewhere? Or perhaps it's just a different version where he isn't dead. I'm not sure. Let me think about the plot of The Lion King 2. It focuses more on Kovu and his role in the Pride Lands dealing with Scar's legacy but not having him as an active character.I don't recall any scenes where Scar is alive or appears. So based on that I think Scar isn't alive in The Lion King 2. He was killed at the end of the first movie and there's no indication he comes back.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,114.38108900000225,0.04170590658285003,0.012245712904244935,0.0,0.0,0.0
29,<think>Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether alligators drown their prey and then eat it later. Hmm I remember hearing that alligators are big predators but I'm not exactly sure about their hunting methods. Let me think.Alligators have strong jaws right? They're known for being ambush predators which means they wait in the water or on land until a prey comes close enough to strike quickly. When they catch something do they drown it? Well alligators can hold their breath for a long time so maybe they submerge their prey underwater to make them drown.But wait I also recall that some animals like crocodiles have been observed dragging prey into the water and holding them there until they can't breathe anymore. Alligators might do something similar. So if an alligator catches a deer or another large animal it might pull it into the water submerge it and wait for it to drown before eating.But then again I'm not entirely sure about this behavior. Maybe they don't always drown their prey. Perhaps they just bite them hard enough to kill instantly and then start eating right away. Or maybe they store the prey somewhere else if they can't eat it immediately.I should also consider how alligators digest their food. They have strong stomachs that can handle bones so maybe they don't need to drown the prey first. But I think the drowning method is more about subduing larger or struggling prey making it easier for them to handle and consume later.Wait another thought: do alligators eat immediately after killing their prey or do they sometimes store it? If they drown the prey maybe they leave it in the water to let it float or sink which could make it easier to retrieve later. But I'm not sure if that's a common behavior.I think I've heard stories of alligators dragging prey into the water and then letting them drown before eating. This would prevent the prey from fighting back once they're submerged. So putting it all together yes alligators do drown their prey and eat it later.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,115.84655960000237,0.04223510135813511,0.012401095386476655,0.0,0.0,0.0
30,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether cowpeas and black-eyed peas are the same thing. Hmm I've heard both terms before but I'm not entirely sure if they're referring to the same plant or different ones.Let me start by recalling what I know about each. Cowpeas as far as I remember are a type of legume that's commonly grown in warm climates. They have pods with seeds inside and I think they're used in various dishes maybe soups or stews. The name ""cowpea"" makes me think it might be related to cattle feed but I'm not certain.Black-eyed peas are another type of legume that I associate more with Southern cuisine in the United States. They have a distinctive black spot on each pea which gives them their name. I've heard they're used in dishes like Hoppin' John and are often eaten around New Year's for good luck.Wait but aren't both cowpeas and black-eyed peas types of Vigna unguiculata? That might mean they belong to the same species but could be different varieties. So maybe they're not exactly the same but closely related.I should check if there are any differences in their appearance or usage. Cowpeas can come in different colors and sizes while black-eyed peas specifically have that black spot. Also cowpeas might refer to a broader category of similar legumes whereas black-eyed peas are a specific type within that group.So putting it all together I think they're not the same thing but are closely related. Cowpeas encompass various types including black-eyed peas. Therefore while they share similarities they aren't identical.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,111.32027409999864,0.04060544980109324,0.011922596134533845,0.0,0.0,0.0

The EEA includes all EU member states plus some other countries like Norway Iceland and Liechtenstein. These non-EU countries are part of the EEA through an agreement that allows them to participate in the EU's internal market.Now the Isle of Man is a Crown dependency which means it's not part of the UK but has its own government. I remember hearing that Crown dependencies have different statuses regarding EU membership. The UK was part of the EEA until Brexit but now the situation might be changing for the Isle of Man as well.I think after Brexit the UK and its dependencies had to negotiate their own relationships with the EEA. The Isle of Man has a unique position because it's not part of the EU or the EEA directly. Instead it relies on agreements made by the UK. However since the UK is no longer in the EEA post-Brexit I believe the Isle of Man also isn't part of the EEA anymore.To confirm this I should check if there are any specific agreements between the Isle of Man and the EEA countries. From what I know the Isle of Man has its own trade arrangements but doesn't have a separate EEA membership. Therefore it's not part of the European Economic Area.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,115.27106149998144,0.04203868986217022,0.01234342492711615,0.0,0.0,0.0
33,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Dwyane Wade made the playoffs during his rookie year. Let me start by recalling what I know about Dwyane Wade's career. He was a really good basketball player right? He played for the Miami Heat and had some great moments there.First I should determine when his rookie year was. I think he was drafted in 2003. That makes sense because that was a strong draft class with players like LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony. So his rookie season would have been the 2003-2004 NBA season.Now did the Miami Heat make the playoffs that year? I'm not entirely sure but I remember that in the early years of the Heat they weren't consistently making the playoffs. They had some rebuilding years before becoming a contender later on with Wade and others.Wait let me think about their performance during the 2003-2004 season. The Heat were probably not very strong then. I think they might have been towards the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings. If that's the case they wouldn't have qualified for the playoffs because only the top teams make it.Also considering Wade was a rookie he might not have had enough experience or impact to carry the team into the playoffs. It takes time for a team to build up especially with a young player like him.I should also check if there were any specific achievements that year. I don't recall Wade making the All-Star Game as a rookie which sometimes happens for standout players. That might indicate he wasn't in a playoff team because All-Star appearances can be influenced by team success too.Putting it all together I think the Miami Heat didn't make the playoffs during Dwyane Wade's rookie season.

34,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the dorsal root ganglion carries sensory input. Hmm let me think about what I remember from my biology classes. The dorsal root ganglion is part of the spinal nerves right? Spinal nerves have both sensory and motor components. Wait no actually each spinal nerve has a dorsal root and a ventral root. The dorsal root is sensory and the ventral root is motor.So the dorsal root ganglion must be where the cell bodies of the sensory neurons are located. These neurons receive information from the periphery like touch or pain and then send signals towards the central nervous system. That makes sense because the ganglion is a cluster of neuron cell bodies outside the spinal cord. So yes it's involved in carrying sensory input.I don't think I'm mixing this up with anything else. The ventral root handles motor commands from the CNS to muscles and glands so that's different. Therefore the dorsal root ganglion definitely carries sensory input.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,112.75938130001305,0.04115355994414928,0.012083532558213672,0.0,0.0,0.0
32,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether King Louie died in The Jungle Book from 2016. Let me start by recalling what I know about the movie. The Jungle Book is a live-action adaptation of the classic Disney animated film. It stars Neel Sethi as Mowgli and features several voice actors like Bill Murray as Baloo Ben Kingsley as Bagheera and Scarlett Johansson as Raksha.Now King Louie is the character from the original story who's a giant ape and the ruler of the monkeys. In the 2016 movie I believe he was portrayed by Christopher Walken. The main conflict in the film revolves around Mowgli trying to return the dangerous tiger Shere Khan to the human village because it's too dangerous for him to stay in the jungle.I remember that King Louie plays a significant role in this story. He wants to take over the jungle and is against Mowgli staying there. There's a scene where he confronts Mowgli Bagheera and Baloo. I think during their confrontation King Louie tries to capture them but ends up getting defeated or maybe even killed.Wait in the movie after the battle with Shere Khan does King Louie die? Or does he just get defeated and leave? I'm a bit fuzzy on that part. Let me try to visualize the scenes. There's a big fight where Mowgli uses fire against Shere Khan which leads to Shere Khan's death. But what about King Louie?I think after the battle King Louie is still around but maybe not in power anymore. Or perhaps he dies during the chaos. Alternatively maybe he just retreats and isn't seen again. I'm not entirely sure if his character meets a definitive end or if he's just defeated.Wait another thought: in some versions of The Jungle Book King Louie is killed by Shere Khan because he wants to take over. But in the 2016 movie since Shere Khan dies at the end maybe King Louie doesn't die but instead loses his position as ruler. Or perhaps he's killed by someone else.I'm a bit confused now. Let me think about the ending. After Mowgli defeats Shere Khan with fire there's a scene where the animals celebrate and Bagheera tells Mowgli it's time to leave the jungle. I don't recall King Louie being present in that final scene which might suggest he was defeated or died earlier.Alternatively maybe King Louie is just driven away and doesn't die. The movie focuses more on Shere Khan as the main antagonist so perhaps King Louie isn't killed but just loses his power. I'm not certain about this though.Wait another angle: in the original Disney animated version King Louie dies when he falls into a pit while trying to get Mowgli's fire. But that was in the first movie. In the 2016 live-action version did they change that? Maybe they kept it similar or changed it.I think in the 2016 film King Louie doesn't die. Instead he's defeated and possibly loses his position as king but isn't killed. The focus is more on Shere Khan's death. So perhaps the answer is False because King Louie didn't die; he was just overthrown.But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe in some versions or interpretations he does die. Alternatively maybe he dies off-screen or in a different way. I need to be careful here.Wait let me try to remember specific scenes. There's a part where King Louie confronts Mowgli and the others and there's a fight. During this fight perhaps King Louie is killed by someone else like Shere Khan or another animal. Or maybe he falls off a cliff or something.Alternatively in the 2016 movie after the battle with Shere Khan I think King Louie isn't shown again which might imply that he died during the chaos. But I'm not certain about this.Hmm I'm going back and forth here. On one hand in the original story King Louie dies when trying to get fire from Mowgli. In the 2016 version maybe they kept that element but adjusted it. Alternatively they might have changed it so he doesn't die.Wait another thought: in the live-action movie there's a scene where King Louie is fighting and perhaps gets hit by falling debris or something leading to his death. But I'm not sure if that actually happens on screen.I think I need to make an educated guess here. Given that the 2016 movie was more focused on Shere Khan as the main antagonist it's possible that King Louie didn't die but was just defeated. However in some versions he does die so maybe in this one too.Alternatively perhaps he dies off-screen or is killed by someone else. I'm not entirely sure but based on what I remember I think the answer might be False because he doesn't die; instead he's defeated and loses his position.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,136.29017069999827,0.04975567633614299,0.014609291049903455,0.0,0.0,0.0
35,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether England has ever won the Women's World Cup. Hmm let me think about this step by step.First I know that the FIFA Women's World Cup is a major international football tournament for women's national teams. It started in 1991 right? So it's been around for over three decades now. England has a strong women's football team but have they ever won the title?I remember hearing about the US women's team being really dominant winning multiple times. They've had some famous players like Mia Hamm and more recently Alex Morgan. But what about other countries? I think Germany has also been quite successful maybe winning a couple of times.Wait when did England last play in the World Cup? I think they were in the 2019 tournament. How did they do there? They made it to the semi-finals if I recall correctly. That's pretty good but not enough to win the cup.I'm trying to remember any instances where England won. Maybe in earlier tournaments? Let me see... The first Women's World Cup was 1991 hosted by China. The US won that one. Then in 1995 Sweden hosted and again the US won. In 1999 the US hosted and they won as well.Then came 2003 which was in the United States again and the US team won once more. So by this point the US had four consecutive wins. Then in 2007 it was held in China again and Germany won that one for the first time. In 2011 Germany hosted and they won again. The next tournament was in Canada in 2015 where the US team came back to win. So far the US has five wins Germany two.Then in 2019 it was held in France. I think England made a good run but lost in the semi-finals to the US. The final was between the US and the Netherlands which the US won again. So up until now the Women's World Cup has been dominated by the US and Germany. I don't recall any wins for England. They've had some strong performances especially recently but not a win yet.Therefore based on this timeline and my memory of the results it seems that England has never won the Women's World Cup.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,128.1855896000052,0.04680419248536383,0.013742674619773642,0.0,0.0,0.0
36,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether finding a four-leaf clover is considered lucky. Hmm I remember hearing about this before but let me think through it step by step.First what do I know about clovers? Well they're plants with leaves right? And typically clovers have three leaves. So when someone finds one with four leaves instead of three that's unusual. I think people often associate four-leaf clovers with good luck. But why is that?Maybe it's because they're rare. If something is rare and you find it it feels special or lucky. Also in folklore and superstitions certain things are considered symbols of good fortune. For example a horseshoe is supposed to bring luck so maybe the four-leaf clover fits into that category.I've seen images where four-leaf clovers are used as symbols for luck especially in Irish culture. Ireland is known for its association with green and shamrocks which are three-leaved clovers. But a four-leaf one might be an even stronger symbol of good luck because it's harder to find.Are there any other reasons? Maybe in some mythologies or stories the four leaves represent something like faith hope love and luck each leaf standing for one of these. That could reinforce the idea that finding such a clover is lucky.I don't recall hearing anything about four-leaf clovers being unlucky. It seems consistently portrayed as a positive symbol. So putting it all together yes I think it's widely believed to be lucky.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,127.75042579998262,0.0466570821484702,0.013699479995835486,0.0,0.0,0.0
38,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the movie ""Love Child"" is based on a true story. First I should probably check what the movie is about. From what I remember it's a South Korean film that deals with some pretty heavy themes like child abuse and family secrets. The main character is a young girl who uncovers dark truths about her family.I think the director might have taken inspiration from real events or maybe personal experiences but I'm not sure if there was an actual true story that it's directly based on. Sometimes movies are inspired by real-life incidents without being exact replicas. I should look up some sources to confirm this.Looking online I see that while ""Love Child"" is a fictional story it does tackle issues that are unfortunately common in society. The director has mentioned wanting to shed light on these sensitive topics rather than recounting a specific true event. So it's more about raising awareness through a fictional narrative rather than being based on one particular real story.Therefore the answer would be False because it's not directly based on a true story but is inspired by real-life issues.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,124.49461480000173,0.04547597535949998,0.013352682723409535,0.0,0.0,0.0
37,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the Mafia is still active in New Jersey. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about the Mafia. The Mafia also known as La Cosa Nostra is a criminal organization that originated in Sicily and later spread to other parts of the world including the United States.I remember hearing that the Mafia was particularly strong in places like New York New Jersey and Pennsylvania. They were involved in various illegal activities such as gambling drug trafficking and extortion. But I'm not sure if they're still active today or if their influence has waned over time.I think law enforcement has been targeting organized crime groups for decades. There have been several high-profile cases where key figures in the Mafia were arrested or had to go into Witness Protection Program. For example I recall hearing about thePizza Connection case and other operations that dismantled parts of the organization.However just because some members are caught doesn't necessarily mean the entire organization is gone. Maybe they've changed their tactics or moved into different areas. The Mafia has been known to adapt over time. They might be involved in new types of crimes or operating more discreetly now.I should also consider the current state of organized crime in New Jersey specifically. Are there recent news articles or reports about Mafia activities? I don't remember hearing much about them lately but that doesn't mean they're not still around. It's possible that their presence is less overt than it was in the past.Another angle to think about is the structure of the Mafia. They have a hierarchical system with families and various levels of leadership. If key leaders are removed does that dismantle the entire operation or do new members take over? I believe the latter is more likely because these organizations tend to be resilient.Also considering the global nature of crime maybe the Mafia has expanded beyond traditional areas. They might have connections in other countries or involved in international drug trafficking or cybercrime. But does that mean they're still active in New Jersey?I should also think about the impact of technology and law enforcement techniques. Modern policing uses more advanced surveillance methods and data analysis which could make it harder for organized crime groups to operate as openly as before.In summary while the Mafia's influence might not be as prominent or visible as it was decades ago there are still reports and evidence suggesting that they maintain some level of activity in regions like New Jersey. They may have evolved their methods and operations to avoid detection but haven't completely disappeared.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,135.90355779998936,0.04964115877823158,0.014575666336965191,0.0,0.0,0.0
39,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether thread seal tape is the same as Teflon tape. Hmm let me think about this. I've heard both terms before in contexts related to plumbing or fixing things around the house. First what do I know about each? Thread seal tape is something used when connecting pipes right? It's supposed to create a watertight or airtight seal. I remember seeing it wrapped around pipe threads before they're screwed together. It helps prevent leaks and also acts as a lubricant so the connection isn't too tight.Then there's Teflon tape. I think that's another name for it but maybe not exactly? Or is it a different product altogether? Wait Teflon is a brand name for polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) which is known for being slippery and non-reactive. So Teflon tape would be made of PTFE material.I think thread seal tape is often made from PTFE as well because it needs to have those properties—slippery to make tightening easier and resistant to chemicals or heat. But maybe there are other materials used for thread seal tape too? Or perhaps all thread seal tapes are Teflon but not all Teflon tapes are used for threading?Wait no I think they're the same thing. People use both terms interchangeably when talking about that white slippery tape you wrap around pipes before connecting them. So in practical terms yes they're the same product.But maybe there's a technical difference? Like Teflon is a specific brand so thread seal tape could be a generic term for any PTFE-based tape used for sealing threads. But in common usage people refer to it as both without distinguishing between brands and types.So putting it all together I think the answer is yes they're the same.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,133.13365039997734,0.04864596298901967,0.01428345636200654,0.0,0.0,0.0
40,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if liquor stores in Oklahoma are open on the 4th of July. Hmm let me think about this step by step.First I know that holidays can affect business hours especially for places like liquor stores which might have different regulations. The 4th of July is a major holiday in the US so it's possible that some businesses close or have reduced hours.I remember that Oklahoma has specific laws regarding alcohol sales. They have something called ""dry counties"" where alcohol sales are restricted but I'm not sure if that applies to all areas. Maybe on holidays like the 4th of July even in wet counties stores might be closed?Wait I think some states require liquor stores to close on certain holidays. For example in Texas they have to close on Sundays and major holidays. Does Oklahoma have similar rules? Let me try to recall or find information about Oklahoma's alcohol laws.I believe that in Oklahoma the sale of alcohol is regulated by the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (OABC). They might have specific guidelines about when liquor stores can operate. I should check if the 4th of July is one of those days when sales are prohibited.Looking it up I find that in Oklahoma most retail establishments including liquor stores are allowed to be open on the 4th of July unless there's a state law prohibiting it. However some businesses might choose to close for the holiday regardless of legal requirements.Wait but I also remember hearing that in some states alcohol sales are prohibited on certain holidays. Is Oklahoma one of them? Let me think again. No I don't recall Oklahoma having such restrictions specifically for the 4th of July. They do have dry counties but those are more about year-round restrictions rather than specific days.So putting it all together: unless there's a state law saying otherwise liquor stores in Oklahoma can be open on the 4th of July. However individual stores might choose to close for the holiday. But the question is whether they're ""open "" not necessarily if every single store is open.Therefore I think the answer is that yes liquor stores in Oklahoma are typically open on the 4th of July unless it's a dry county or the specific store decides to close.</think>True",True,False,0,0.0,131.15471179998713,0.047922463690272296,0.014071022070923988,0.0,0.0,0.0
41,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether you have to be Mormon to attend BYU. Let me start by recalling what I know about BYU. It's Brigham Young University right? And I think it's associated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which is the Mormon church.I remember hearing that BYU is a religious institution so maybe there are some requirements related to faith or beliefs for students. But does that mean you have to be Mormon to enroll?I should consider what the actual policies are. I think BYU has a Honor Code that all students must adhere to which includes things like honesty integrity and following certain behavioral standards. I'm not sure if being Mormon is explicitly required but maybe there's an expectation of belief in some principles.Wait I also recall something about a testimony or declaration of faith. Perhaps students are asked to affirm their beliefs as part of the application process. But does that mean non-Mormons can't attend? Or is it more about aligning with certain values?I should check if there's any official statement from BYU regarding this. From what I know BYU is open to all students regardless of their religious background but they do emphasize a commitment to the principles of the Mormon church. So while you don't have to be Mormon there might be an expectation to live according to certain standards.Also considering that BYU offers a unique environment with religious classes and activities it's likely that most students are Mormons but not all. There could be exceptions or specific programs for non-Mormon students as well.In summary while BYU is closely tied to the Mormon church I don't think being Mormon is an absolute requirement to attend. However there might be some expectations regarding religious beliefs and practices.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,128.39068440001574,0.046919166599887804,0.013776433387133932,0.0,0.0,0.0

Dr. Murphy is a main character but I'm not sure about Dr. Burke. Wait maybe that's a mix-up. I think Dr. Murphy is the one who was in Season 1 and then left. But the user is asking about Dr. Burke.Hmm I don't remember a Dr. Burke being a major character in ""The Good Doctor."" Maybe they're confusing him with someone else? Or perhaps he's from another show. Let me think... In Season 3 there are several new characters introduced but I can't recall one named Dr. Burke. The main cast includes Murphy Murphy leaves after Season 1 and then in later seasons other characters come and go.Wait maybe the user is referring to a different show? Or perhaps they made a typo. If it's about ""The Good Doctor "" I don't think Dr. Burke is part of that series. Alternatively if it's another medical drama like ""Grey's Anatomy "" there are various doctors but I'm not sure about a Dr. Burke returning after Season 3.Alternatively maybe the user is talking about a character from an earlier season who returns later. But in ""The Good Doctor "" the main characters don't usually leave and come back unless it's for specific storylines.

43,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether a dog can be mixed with three breeds. Hmm let's break this down. First what does it mean for a dog to be mixed? A mixed breed typically means that the dog has parents of different purebred species. So if you have a dog whose parents are from two different breeds that's a mix of two breeds.Now can there be three breeds involved? Well let's think about how dogs reproduce. Each parent contributes half of their genetic material to the offspring. If one parent is already a mixed breed say a mix of Breed A and Breed B then when they have a puppy with another dog that's a purebred from Breed C the resulting puppy would have genes from all three breeds: A B and C.So in this case yes it's possible for a dog to be a mix of three breeds. Each generation can introduce new breeds into the mix. For example if you have a first-generation mix (like a Labradoodle which is Labrador Retriever and Poodle) then breed that with another purebred say a Golden Retriever the resulting puppies would have genes from all three: Labrador Poodle and Golden Retriever.I guess it's also possible for more than three breeds to be involved if you continue this process across multiple generations. But in terms of being mixed with three breeds specifically yes that can happen by breeding a two-breed mix with another purebred.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,125.94304959999863,0.04602477812970158,0.013513822516680606,0.0,0.0,0.0
44,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the right atrium receives blood from the lungs. Let me start by recalling what I know about the human heart and circulation.The heart has four chambers: two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers). The right side of the heart deals with deoxygenated blood while the left side handles oxygenated blood. Blood from the body comes into the heart through the superior and inferior vena cava which empty into the right atrium. From there it goes to the right ventricle then gets pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs for oxygenation.On the other hand oxygenated blood returns from the lungs via the pulmonary veins which empty into the left atrium. So the left atrium receives blood from the lungs not the right atrium.Wait but sometimes I get confused between the two sides. Let me visualize it: the right side is for deoxygenated blood coming back from the body and the left side is for oxygenated blood going out to the body. So yes the right atrium doesn't receive blood directly from the lungs; that's the job of the left atrium.I think I'm confident now. The right atrium receives blood from the body via the vena cava not from the lungs.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,122.45481509997626,0.04476412271614307,0.013143668130156187,0.0,0.0,0.0
45,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether a ""certification of birth"" is the same as a ""birth certificate."" Hmm let me think about this step by step.First I know that a birth certificate is an official document that records someone's birth. It usually includes details like the person's name date and place of birth parents' names etc. It's issued by government authorities right? People use it for legal purposes like applying for a passport or getting a driver's license.Now what about a ""certification of birth""? The term sounds similar but maybe slightly different. I'm not entirely sure if it's the same as a birth certificate. Maybe it's another name for the same thing? Or perhaps it refers to something else related to birth records.I should consider the wording. ""Certification"" generally means an official statement that something is true or genuine. So a certification of birth would be an official document confirming someone's birth details. That sounds exactly like what a birth certificate is.Wait could there be any differences? Maybe in some contexts ""certification of birth"" refers to a specific type of document perhaps from another country or region where the terminology differs. But in general terms I think they're used interchangeably.I should also check if there are any official sources that define these terms. For example government websites often use ""birth certificate "" but maybe some jurisdictions refer to it as a certification. However regardless of the name the purpose and content would be the same: proving someone's birth details officially.So putting it all together I believe that a certification of birth is indeed the same as a birth certificate. They both serve the same purpose and contain similar information.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,126.83463150000898,0.04636111648730094,0.013612578383734234,0.0,0.0,0.0
46,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether every country has its own sign language. Hmm let's start by thinking about what a sign language is. Sign languages are visual languages used primarily by deaf communities. They have their own grammar and syntax just like spoken languages.Now considering that there are over 190 countries in the world does each one have a distinct sign language? I know that some countries share similar or even identical sign languages because of historical ties or cultural similarities. For example American Sign Language (ASL) is used not only in the United States but also in parts of Canada and other regions where ASL has influenced local deaf communities.Wait but does every single country have at least one? I'm trying to think if there are any countries without a recognized sign language. Maybe some smaller or less developed nations might rely on international sign languages rather than having their own. However even in those cases they often develop localized signs over time especially within their deaf communities.Also considering that sign languages can vary regionally within a country like how dialects exist in spoken languages. So while a country might have one primary sign language there could be variations or multiple sign languages used in different regions of the same country.But does every country have at least one? I think so because even if they don't have an officially recognized sign language deaf communities within those countries develop their own forms of communication. These might not always be standardized but they still count as sign languages specific to that region or country.So putting it all together while some countries share sign languages due to historical reasons every country does have its own sign language even if it's a regional variation or less formally recognized.</think>True,True,False,0,0.0,123.60543730002246,0.045183762921379864,0.013266883134874997,0.0,0.0,0.0

Hmm I remember hearing that the national legal drinking age is 21 but I'm not entirely sure if every single state follows this. Maybe some states have different laws? Let me think about this.I know that the 26th Amendment sets the voting age at 18 but that's unrelated to drinking. The minimum drinking age is actually set by each state right? But wait there was a federal law called the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 which required states to have a minimum drinking age of 21 or lose some federal highway funding. That probably influenced all states to adopt it.But I'm not certain if every state actually does. Maybe some states allow exceptions like for religious purposes or with parental consent? For example in some places you can drink under 21 if it's within a family setting or for medical reasons. But the minimum age is still technically 21 across all states because of that federal law.Wait I think all states do enforce 21 as the minimum drinking age but they might have exceptions. So the answer would be true because every state has 21 as the legal age even if there are some exceptions in certain circumstances.</think>True,True,False,0,0.0,122.36520369999926,0.04473442325773802,0.0131349477576517,0.0,0.0,0.0
47,"<think>Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether ""dry water"" actually exists. The question is asking if there's such a thing as dry water and the answer needs to be just True or False without any explanations or punctuation. First off I know that water is H2O which is a liquid under normal conditions. But maybe in some contexts people refer to something else when they say ""dry water."" Maybe it's a term used in a specific field like chemistry or engineering.I remember hearing about something called ""dry ice "" which isn't actually ice but solid carbon dioxide. So perhaps ""dry water"" is similar—maybe it's not regular water but another substance that has properties resembling dryness and water-like qualities. Wait I think there's a concept in chemistry where water can be combined with other substances to form something that doesn't behave like liquid water. For example when water is absorbed into a porous material it might retain some of its structure but not flow like liquid. Maybe that's what they mean by dry water.I should check if ""dry water"" refers to any known substance or process. From what I recall there are materials called hydrogels which can hold a lot of water but don't drip so maybe in that context it's considered dry because it doesn't spill. Alternatively in some industrial processes they might use something like powdered water for specific applications.Another angle is the concept of anhydrous substances which are completely free of water. But ""dry water"" sounds more like a substance that incorporates water without being liquid. Maybe it's a term used in certain scientific experiments or products where water is present but not in its usual form.I think I've heard about something called ""dry water"" in the context of absorbing oil spills. It's a powder made by coating tiny water droplets with sand which allows it to absorb oil without dissolving. So in that case dry water does exist as a product used for cleaning up oil.So putting it all together while regular liquid water isn't dry there are substances referred to as ""dry water"" that incorporate water in a non-liquid form. Therefore the answer should be True.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,130.02747299999464,0.047535618994584465,0.01395743650307372,0.0,0.0,0.0

The plot involves a plane crash in the mountains and the survivors trying to survive against all odds.I think I remember hearing that it's inspired by real events but I'm not entirely sure if it's directly based on a true story or just loosely inspired. Maybe there was a similar incident where people were stranded after a plane crash? Or perhaps it's more of a fictional tale meant to highlight survival and human resilience.I should check some sources. From what I can gather quickly the movie is actually based on a novel by Charles Martin. The book itself might be inspired by real events or just a work of fiction. However there have been instances where plane crashes led to survivors being stranded in remote areas so it's possible that the story draws from such incidents.But wait I think the specific plot points in ""A Mountain Between Us"" are fictional. The characters and their interactions aren't based on real people. So while the premise might be inspired by real-life scenarios the actual story is created for the film.Therefore it's not a true story per se but rather a fictional account that may have elements based on real events or similar situations.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,120.72520490002353,0.044159518038150415,0.01296614374778714,0.0,0.0,0.0
49,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if there are tolls on I-70 in Kansas. Let me start by recalling what I know about toll roads. Tolls are fees charged for using certain highways or bridges usually to fund their construction and maintenance.I remember that many states have toll roads especially in the eastern US like Pennsylvania Turnpike or New Jersey Turnpike. But I'm not sure about Kansas. I think Kansas is a state in the Midwest so maybe they don't have as many toll roads as other regions.I-70 is a major interstate highway that runs from Colorado to Maryland passing through several states including Kansas. I wonder if any part of it has tolls. Maybe there are specific sections or bridges where tolls apply?Let me think about the structure of highways in Kansas. I believe most interstates in Kansas are funded by state and federal taxes rather than tolls. So perhaps I-70 doesn't have tolls throughout its entire stretch in Kansas.Wait but sometimes even if a highway is generally free there might be specific segments with tolls especially if they're newer or had special funding. For example some states have turned certain highways into toll roads to manage costs.I should check if there are any known toll plazas or signs on I-70 in Kansas. From what I recall when driving through Kansas I don't remember seeing many toll booths. It's possible that the entire stretch of I-70 in Kansas is toll-free.Also considering the state's infrastructure funding they might rely more on gas taxes and other revenue sources rather than implementing tolls on major highways like I-70.So putting it all together I think there are no tolls on I-70 in Kansas. The highway is likely free to use throughout its route within the state.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,127.67554610001389,0.04668959219847738,0.013709025615904907,0.0,0.0,0.0

Public courses are generally open to the general public and don't require membership to play whereas private clubs usually require membership or special access.I'll start by searching for information on Trinity Forest Golf Club. From what I remember it's located in Carrollton Texas which is part of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. It was designed by Greg Norman and opened in 2017. I think it's known for being a high-end facility.Now considering its reputation I believe Trinity Forest is actually a private club. Private clubs often host major events to attract members and showcase their facilities. For example the Club has hosted the Charles Schwab Challenge on the PGA Tour which is a significant event. If it were public they might not have the same level of exclusivity required for such tournaments.Additionally I recall that Trinity Forest requires membership or specific arrangements to play. They don't typically allow walk-ins or casual play like public courses do. The pricing and availability are usually more controlled in private clubs which aligns with what I know about Trinity Forest.So putting it all together the information points towards Trinity Forest Golf Club being a private course rather than a public one.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,124.56401619999087,0.04556697675039405,0.013379402605509735,0.0,0.0,0.0
52,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the away goal counts in the playoffs. Hmm I'm not entirely sure about this but let me think through it step by step.First I know that in soccer tournaments especially in leagues like the Champions League or Europa League the away goal rule is used during knockout stages. The idea is that if two teams are tied on aggregate goals after both legs of a match the team with more away goals wins. This is because playing away can be more challenging so it's seen as an advantage.But wait does this apply to playoffs? Playoffs usually refer to the final stages or additional matches to determine rankings or promotions/relegations in leagues. For example in some leagues if teams are tied on points at the end of the season they might have a playoff match to decide who gets promoted or relegated.Now I'm trying to remember if the away goal rule is used in these playoff scenarios. In most cases playoffs are single matches or sometimes two-legged but not necessarily using the away goal tiebreaker. For instance in the Premier League if teams are tied on points at the end of the season they look at head-to-head results goals scored etc. but I don't think away goals specifically come into play unless it's a two-legged playoff.Wait maybe in some competitions like the FA Cup or other cup tournaments the away goal rule applies during the knockout rounds. But when it comes to league playoffs especially those that determine promotion or relegation they usually have different criteria. They might use goal difference goals scored head-to-head results but I'm not sure about away goals specifically.I should also consider that in some leagues if a playoff is two-legged (like home and away) the away goal rule could apply to break ties. But if it's a single match then there wouldn't be an away goal consideration because both teams are playing at one venue.So putting this together: In general the away goal does count in some playoff scenarios especially when they're two-legged matches. However in many cases particularly in league playoffs that are single matches or use different tiebreakers the away goal might not be a factor. Therefore it's possible that the answer is False because the away goal doesn't always count in all types of playoffs.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,121.1579374000139,0.044324303266457345,0.013014528083773184,0.0,0.0,0.0
53,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether money from Guernsey is legal tender in the UK. Hmm let me start by understanding what each of these terms means.First Guernsey is a Crown dependency right? It's not part of the United Kingdom but has its own government and currency. The UK on the other hand uses the pound sterling as its official currency. Now legal tender refers to money that must be accepted if offered to settle a debt. So if someone owes you money in the UK they can't refuse payment in pounds.But Guernsey has its own currency too called the Guernsey pound. I think it's pegged to the British pound meaning their value is tied together. But does that mean it's accepted as legal tender in the UK? I'm not sure. I remember hearing that some Crown dependencies have their own currencies but they might still accept pounds.Wait let me check. The UK government recognizes Guernsey pounds as a form of currency but are they considered legal tender there? Or is it just that they're accepted because they're pegged? I think in the UK only the Bank of England notes and coins are legal tender. So even though Guernsey pounds might be similar they aren't issued by the Bank of England.So if someone tries to pay with a Guernsey pound in the UK can a shop or service refuse it? I believe they can because it's not official legal tender there. However some places might accept them as they're familiar and have the same value. But legally they don't have to accept it.Therefore even though Guernsey pounds are used in Guernsey and sometimes accepted informally in the UK they aren't recognized as legal tender by UK law.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,117.19614079999155,0.042866293476336755,0.012586426388730854,0.0,0.0,0.0
54,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" is an autobiography. Let me start by recalling what I know about this book. The title sounds familiar; I think it's a memoir or something similar. Maya Angelou wrote it right? She was a well-known poet and author.Now what defines an autobiography? It's a person's life story written by themselves. So if Maya Angelou wrote about her own experiences then yes it would be an autobiography. I remember that the book covers her childhood dealing with racism family issues and her journey to self-discovery. That all sounds like personal experiences she's recounting.Wait but sometimes people confuse memoirs with autobiographies. Memoirs are also about someone's life but they might focus on specific periods or themes rather than a comprehensive life story. So is ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" more of a memoir or an autobiography? I think it's considered a memoir because it focuses on key events and themes from her early life rather than covering every year up to that point.But then again some sources might classify it as an autobiography since it's about her life. Maybe it's both. However the strict definition of an autobiography is a comprehensive account while a memoir can be more selective. So perhaps it's better categorized as a memoir. But I'm not entirely sure. I should double-check.Looking up some quick facts: Maya Angelou wrote several volumes of autobiographies starting with ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."" That suggests that this book is indeed part of her autobiography series covering specific periods in detail. So even though it's a memoir in style it's structured as an autobiography across multiple books.Therefore considering all this I think the answer is True because it's the first installment of her autobiographical works.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,116.02125039999373,0.04244147037765032,0.012461689579778593,0.0,0.0,0.0
55,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the transmission and the engine are the same thing. Hmm let me think about this step by step.First I know that both the engine and transmission are parts of a car's powertrain but they have different roles. The engine is what generates power right? It converts fuel into mechanical energy through combustion. So it's like the heart of the vehicle providing the necessary force to move.On the other hand the transmission is responsible for transferring that power from the engine to the wheels. But wait isn't there more to it? I remember learning about different types of transmissions like manual and automatic. The transmission not only transfers power but also changes gears which affects how fast or efficiently the car can move.So if the engine creates the power the transmission is what manages how that power is used. They work together but have distinct functions. Without the transmission the engine's power wouldn't be effectively utilized to make the car move properly.I think another way to look at it is by considering their locations in a vehicle. The engine is usually under the hood while the transmission is typically found beneath the car connected to the driveshaft. This physical separation also suggests they are separate components with different purposes.Also when something goes wrong with one it affects the other but doesn't mean they're the same. For example if the engine fails the transmission can't function because there's no power being generated. Conversely a transmission issue might cause problems in how the car accelerates or shifts gears but the engine could still be running fine.I've heard terms like ""engine swap"" and ""transmission replacement "" which are separate procedures. This further indicates that they're distinct parts of a vehicle. Mechanics often specialize in either engines or transmissions because each requires different skills and knowledge.In summary while both components are crucial for a car's operation they serve different roles. The engine generates power and the transmission manages how that power is distributed to the wheels. Therefore they aren't the same thing.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,114.09055120000266,0.04172712293754868,0.012251942462832713,0.0,0.0,0.0
56,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the Canadian dollar (CAD) is worth more than the US dollar (USD). Hmm I remember that exchange rates can fluctuate a lot based on various factors like economic performance interest rates and geopolitical events. But as of my last update in 2023 I think the CAD was trading below the USD. Let me try to recall some specific points.First I know that around 2017-2018 the CAD was quite strong compared to the USD sometimes even reaching parity or slightly above. However over time especially with changes in oil prices (since Canada is a major oil exporter) and shifts in monetary policies by central banks the value can change.In recent years I believe the USD has been stronger due to factors like higher interest rates set by the Federal Reserve compared to the Bank of Canada. This tends to attract more foreign investment into the US thereby increasing the demand for USD and making it stronger against other currencies including CAD.Also considering economic indicators if the US economy is performing better or showing signs of growth relative to Canada's that could strengthen the USD further. Additionally global events like trade tensions or pandemics can impact exchange rates. For example during the COVID-19 pandemic both currencies were affected but I think the USD held up relatively better.Looking at specific exchange rate numbers as of my last update in 2023 one CAD was worth less than one USD. So for instance if the exchange rate is around 0.75 USD per CAD that means it takes about 1.33 CAD to equal 1 USD. This indicates that the USD is stronger.I should also consider that exchange rates are dynamic and can change daily based on market sentiment and economic data releases. However without real-time information beyond my last update I have to rely on historical trends up until then.So putting it all together as of the knowledge cutoff in 2023 the Canadian dollar was generally worth less than the US dollar.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,119.24229240001296,0.043625525283814956,0.012809352480115046,0.0,0.0,0.0
57,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is a prequel. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Indiana Jones movies.First off there are four main films featuring Indiana Jones as the protagonist. The first one was ""Raiders of the Lost Ark "" released in 1981. Then came ""The Temple of Doom"" in 1984 followed by ""The Last Crusade"" in 1989 and finally ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" in 2008.Now a prequel is a story that takes place before the events of the original work. So I need to determine if ""Temple of Doom"" happens before ""Raiders."" In ""Raiders "" Indiana Jones is searching for the Ark of the Covenant during World War II. The movie starts in 1936 and ends in 1945 when the Ark is hidden at the end of the war. Looking at ""Temple of Doom "" it's set in 1935 which is just before the events of ""Raiders."" In this film Indiana Jones deals with a cult that wants to use ancient artifacts for dark purposes. The timeline makes sense because 1935 comes before 1936 when Raiders begins.Additionally looking at the character development in ""Temple of Doom "" Indy is portrayed as more reckless and less experienced compared to his portrayal in ""Raiders."" This suggests that it's an earlier point in his career further supporting the idea that it's a prequel.I should also consider any connections between the two films. For example some characters or artifacts from ""Temple of Doom"" might appear later in ""Raiders "" indicating continuity and reinforcing the prequel status.However I remember that sometimes sequels can have overlapping timelines or even be set in the same time period but focus on different events. But given the clear chronological order here—1935 vs. 1936—it seems pretty straightforward that ""Temple of Doom"" is indeed a prequel to ""Raiders.""So putting it all together: ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" takes place before the events of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark "" making it a prequel.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,117.65056549999281,0.043049270200393994,0.012640152122435097,0.0,0.0,0.0
58,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether there's ever been a perfect tennis match. Hmm what does ""perfect"" mean in this context? Maybe it refers to a match where every point went exactly as planned without any errors or upsets. Or perhaps it means a match that was flawless in terms of gameplay and strategy.I remember hearing about some legendary matches in tennis history. For example the 2012 Wimbledon final between Roger Federer and Andy Murray. That was a really intense match with multiple sets and tiebreakers. But was it perfect? I don't think so because both players made mistakes throughout the game.Another thought: maybe a perfect match is one where all points were won by the same player resulting in a straight-sets victory without any breaks of serve. That would be technically flawless in terms of dominance. But even then tennis matches usually have some back-and-forth moments.Wait there's also the concept of a ""love"" score which means winning a set without the opponent scoring any points. If someone won all sets 6-0 and didn't drop a single game that might be considered perfect. I think Bjorn Borg had some dominant performances but did he ever win a match with all sets being 6-0? I'm not sure.I should also consider if ""perfect"" refers to the quality of play rather than the scoreline. Maybe a match where both players played exceptionally well making it a classic in terms of skill and strategy. But that's more about the观赏性 (entertainment value) rather than perfection in execution.Looking up some historical data I recall that in 1968 at Wimbledon Ken Rosewall defeated Roy Emerson 6-0 6-0 6-0. That was a significant win because it was a clean sweep without dropping any sets. But does that count as a perfect match? It depends on the definition. If perfection is about dominance and not making mistakes then yes. However if it's about both players playing flawlessly then no.Another angle: in doubles matches sometimes teams can win all their games but I'm focusing on singles here. So considering singles matches has anyone ever won a match without dropping a single game? That would be three sets of 6-0 each. It's rare but possible. For example Monica Seles had some dominant performances but I don't recall her winning a match with all sets being 6-0.Wait in the Davis Cup or other tournaments sometimes players might have such dominant wins but it's not common. Maybe in lower-level matches but at the professional level it's extremely rare. So if someone has done that then yes there was a perfect match in terms of scoreline.But I'm not entirely sure about any specific instance where a player won all sets 6-0 in a professional match. It might have happened but it's not something widely talked about. Most matches have some give and take even if one player is dominant.So considering all this I think the answer would be False because while there have been extremely dominant performances achieving a perfect scoreline without any points dropped in every set is almost unheard of at the highest levels of professional tennis.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,129.4465706999763,0.047380218744693316,0.01391180778998881,0.0,0.0,0.0
60,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether chewing tobacco is banned in Major League Baseball (MLB). Let me start by recalling what I know about MLB's policies on substances like chewing tobacco.I remember that MLB has been concerned about the health risks associated with smokeless tobacco. Chewing tobacco can cause various health issues including oral cancer and other mouth diseases. So it makes sense they might have regulations against it.I think there was a rule introduced in the 1990s or early 2000s that banned chewing tobacco. I believe this came after some players were caught using it and there was pressure from both within and outside the league to take action for health reasons.Wait but I also heard that some players still use it despite the ban. Maybe they find ways around the rules or use alternative products that aren't technically banned. But as far as official policy goes MLB does have a ban on chewing tobacco.So putting it all together yes chewing tobacco is banned in Major League Baseball.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,120.7959092000383,0.04420827019600024,0.012980458385146849,0.0,0.0,0.0
59,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Mickey and Minnie's house is still located in Magic Kingdom. Let me start by recalling what I know about Magic Kingdom and its attractions.Magic Kingdom is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. It has various lands like Main Street U.S.A. Adventureland Frontierland Fantasyland and Tomorrowland. Each land has different rides shows and character meet-and-greets.I remember that Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse are central characters in Disney so they must have a presence in Magic Kingdom. I think there's an area dedicated to them where guests can meet them. But is it called ""Mickey and Minnie's House""?Wait maybe it's not exactly a house but more of a pavilion or a stage where they perform shows. I recall something about a show where Mickey and Minnie interact with the audience perhaps in an amphitheater setting.I think the area might be called ""Mickey's Toontown"" or something similar. In that area there are various attractions like the Roger Rabbit ride and maybe a stage for meet-and-greets. So if it's not exactly a house but more of a dedicated space within Toontown then the answer would depend on whether they consider that as their ""house.""Alternatively I might be confusing it with another Disney park. For example in Disneyland Paris or Hong Kong Disneyland there are specific areas for Mickey and Minnie. But focusing on Magic Kingdom specifically.I should also consider if there have been any changes or relocations. Sometimes theme parks remodel or move attractions. Maybe the original house was moved or replaced with a new area.Wait I think in Magic Kingdom the main place to meet Mickey and Minnie is in the central part of the park perhaps near Main Street. There's a spot where they have character meet-and-greets but it might not be called ""Mickey and Minnie's House.""Alternatively maybe there was a specific house structure that served as their residence within the park but I'm not sure if it still exists or has been changed.I should also think about any recent updates or news from Disney regarding changes in Magic Kingdom. If they've renovated areas like Toontown perhaps the house is no longer present or has been transformed into something else.Another angle: sometimes ""houses"" in theme parks are more symbolic like the houses of other characters such as Snow White or Cinderella. So maybe Mickey and Minnie have a similar structure where guests can visit them.But I'm not entirely certain if it's still there. Maybe I should check my memory about specific attractions. For instance ""Mickey's PhilharMagic"" is a show in Magic Kingdom that takes place in a movie theater setting but that's different from their house.Alternatively the area where they have meet-and-greets might be considered their house for guests. So if that location still exists then yes it's still there.I'm leaning towards thinking that while Mickey and Minnie do have a presence in Magic Kingdom it's not exactly a traditional ""house"" but more of a designated area or stage where they interact with visitors. Therefore the answer might be False because there isn't a specific house structure anymore or perhaps it has been renamed or repurposed.Wait I'm getting confused now. Maybe I should think about other parks for comparison. In Disneyland in California Mickey's House is a distinct building where guests can meet him. So perhaps Magic Kingdom also has such a structure.But I'm not sure if it's still there as of the latest information. If Disney has updated or changed that area maybe the house isn't present anymore.Alternatively perhaps the question refers to an attraction rather than a physical house. For example ""Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway"" is a ride in some parks but I'm not sure if it's in Magic Kingdom.Wait no that ride is in Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World not Magic Kingdom. So maybe the house isn't part of an attraction but rather a meet-and-greet spot.In summary my uncertainty stems from whether ""Mickey and Minnie's House"" refers to a specific structure or just their general area in the park. If it's a specific building I'm not sure if it still exists. But if it's more about where they are located for meet-and-greets then yes that area is still present.Given all this I think the answer might be False because there isn't a standalone house structure anymore in Magic Kingdom dedicated to Mickey and Minnie as of recent updates.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,136.3948495000077,0.049929053406847466,0.014660198127724875,0.0,0.0,0.0
61,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether there's still a water crisis in Cape Town. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic. I remember hearing a few years ago that Cape Town was facing an severe water shortage almost reaching the point of ""Day Zero"" where they would have to turn off taps. That was around 2017-2018 if I'm not mistaken.Since then I think there were some measures taken by the government and the local authorities to manage water usage. They probably implemented restrictions on water consumption maybe even pricing mechanisms or public awareness campaigns. Also they might have invested in infrastructure improvements like desalination plants or water recycling projects.But does that mean the crisis is over? Well I should consider factors like current weather patterns rainfall levels and how sustainable those measures are. Cape Town's climate is generally dry so relying on seasonal rains isn't always reliable. If there have been good rainy seasons recently that could help replenish reservoirs. However if the past few years have been drier than usual the crisis might still be ongoing.I should also think about how effective the conservation efforts were. Did people comply with water restrictions? Have industries and agriculture adapted to use water more efficiently? If these measures are sustained it could prevent another severe crisis. But if complacency sets in or if there's a lapse in enforcement the situation might deteriorate again.Another angle is looking at reports from recent years. I think in 2019 they managed to avoid Day Zero by implementing strict water management policies and getting lucky with some rainfall. However as of more recent times say 2023 have there been any news about water shortages? I'm not sure but it's possible that while the immediate crisis was averted the underlying issues like population growth climate change impacts and infrastructure limitations might still pose risks.So putting this all together: Cape Town had a severe water crisis a few years back took measures to mitigate it and managed to avoid the worst-case scenarios. However whether the crisis is entirely resolved depends on current conditions ongoing management efforts and future challenges like climate change. It's possible that while the acute crisis has passed there are still concerns about long-term water sustainability in the region.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,132.01719410001533,0.04833177323903547,0.014191203782192218,0.0,0.0,0.0
62,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Guitar Center and Musician's Friend are the same company. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two companies.Guitar Center is a well-known name in the music retail industry. They have physical stores where you can buy guitars amps accessories and other musical instruments. I've heard they also offer lessons and repairs. On the other hand Musician's Friend seems like an online retailer that sells similar products—guitars drums keyboards etc.—but I'm not sure if they have physical locations.I think Guitar Center might be more of a bricks-and-mortar store with a strong online presence as well. Musician's Friend from what I remember is primarily an online store without the same level of physical retail outlets. But maybe they're related somehow?Wait could they be subsidiaries or part of the same parent company? Sometimes companies acquire others to expand their reach. Let me think about any news or information I've come across regarding mergers or acquisitions in this sector.I recall that Guitar Center has been around for a while and expanded quite a bit. Musician's Friend also seems established but perhaps they were acquired by Guitar Center at some point? Or maybe it's the other way around?Alternatively they could be competitors offering similar products but operating independently. I don't remember seeing any official announcements stating that they're the same company so I might have to look into their ownership structures.Another angle is checking if they share the same parent company or if there are executives who overlap between both companies. If they do that would suggest a connection beyond just being competitors.I think it's possible that Guitar Center owns Musician's Friend as an online division but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively they might be separate entities with similar product offerings but different business models—one focusing on physical stores and the other on e-commerce.To sum up based on my current knowledge I don't believe Guitar Center and Musician's Friend are the same company. They seem to operate independently each with their own brand identity and distribution channels.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,132.74740409999504,0.04860053576717881,0.014270117994320044,0.0,0.0,0.0
63,"<think>Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether Beckett ever finds out who killed her mom in the TV show ""Castle."" I remember watching some episodes where she's really focused on solving her mother's murder. She seems obsessed with it and it's a big part of her character development.I think throughout the series there are several clues and suspects that come up. There was this guy named Gregson who was involved in some shady deals and he might have been connected to her mom's death. But I'm not sure if they ever conclusively solve it or if it's left open-ended.Wait wasn't there an episode where they found out something about the case? Maybe towards the end of the series? Or did they just hint at it without giving a clear answer? I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. I think in some seasons they bring up old cases and sometimes resolve them but I don't remember if Beckett's mom's murder was one of those.I should probably check my memory. In season 1 or 2 there were episodes where they looked into her mother's case more deeply. They found some evidence that pointed to someone specific maybe a corrupt cop or someone from the art world since her mom was an artist. But I'm not certain if they ever actually identified the killer.Wait wasn't there a point where Beckett thought she knew who did it but then it turned out to be a red herring? Or maybe they found the person but didn't get closure because of some legal issues or the suspect died before being caught?I think in the later seasons especially towards the end they started wrapping up loose ends. Maybe her mom's murder was one of them. But I'm not 100% sure. It could be that it was left unresolved to keep some mystery but I have a feeling they did solve it.Alternatively maybe Beckett never finds out because it's part of her character's journey—always searching for answers without ever fully finding them. That would make sense as a narrative choice to keep her motivated throughout the series.Hmm I'm going back and forth here. On one hand some cases are resolved but others aren't. Since her mom's murder is such a central part of her story it might have been resolved in a later season or movie. Or perhaps they just hinted at it without giving a definitive answer.I think the answer is that she does find out who killed her mom but I'm not entirely certain. Maybe in one of the final episodes they reveal the killer's identity after all these years.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,139.4861623000179,0.05107852756948762,0.014997707409739307,0.0,0.0,0.0
64,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if any Civil War battles were fought in Florida. Hmm I remember that the American Civil War was mainly between the Northern states and the Southern states right? Florida was a Confederate state so they were part of the South. But I'm not sure how much fighting actually happened there.I think most of the major battles were in places like Virginia Pennsylvania or Tennessee. Maybe some in Georgia too like Atlanta. But Florida... I don't recall hearing about big battles there. Wait maybe there were smaller skirmishes or something? Or perhaps naval battles?Let me think about what Florida's role was during the Civil War. Since it's on the coast maybe they had some coastal defenses or blockades. There might have been some action around ports like Jacksonville or Pensacola. I remember that Pensacola was a Confederate base early on but later captured by Union forces.Also there were some forts in Florida. Fort Pickens comes to mind; it was near Pensacola. I think the Union took control of that fort early in the war and held onto it throughout. That might have led to some fighting or at least military presence there.Another thing is that Florida's economy was based on agriculture especially citrus and sugar but not as much cotton as other Southern states. Maybe this made it less of a target for Union forces focused on disrupting the Confederacy's economy.But wait I think there were some battles in Florida. For example the Battle of Olustee which I believe was one of the larger land battles fought in Florida. It happened in 1864 near Lake City. The Union wanted to disrupt Confederate supply lines and free enslaved people but they were defeated by the Confederates.So even though Florida wasn't a major theater like Virginia or Tennessee there were still some significant battles there. There might have been other smaller skirmishes as well especially in areas where the Union tried to establish control or disrupt Confederate activities.In summary while Florida wasn't the site of many large-scale battles compared to other states there were indeed Civil War battles fought there such as the Battle of Olustee and some naval engagements along the coast.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,138.616726200009,0.05075959306706762,0.014904061672914595,0.0,0.0,0.0
65,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether minors can receive the death penalty. Hmm I remember hearing something about this in school but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think through it step by step.First what's considered a minor? In most places that's someone under 18 years old. Now does any country allow executing people who were minors when they committed the crime?I recall that the United States has some states where this might have been possible in the past. But I think there was a Supreme Court case about it. Oh right Roper v. Simmons! That case ruled that executing minors is unconstitutional because it's cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.So after that 2005 decision the U.S. can't execute minors anymore. But what about other countries? I'm not as sure about international laws. Some countries might still allow it but many have abolished capital punishment for minors. The United Nations has resolutions against executing minors so most member states probably don't do it.Wait are there any exceptions or specific cases where a minor could be sentenced to death? Maybe in some countries with different legal systems or interpretations. But generally the trend is towards abolishing such sentences for minors because of their age and the belief that they're less culpable than adults.So putting it all together: In the U.S. no you can't get the death penalty as a minor anymore. Internationally while some countries might still allow it many have moved away from it. But the question is pretty broad so I think the answer would be that generally minors cannot receive the death penalty in most places today.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,139.09253749999334,0.05094254928983185,0.014957781387017087,0.0,0.0,0.0
66,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Trinidad and Tobago were part of the World Cup in 2018. Let me start by recalling what I know about the World Cup. The FIFA World Cup is held every four years right? So 2018 was a World Cup year with the tournament taking place in Russia.Now I remember that each World Cup has teams from different countries competing. But not all countries make it; they have to qualify through various tournaments and stages. Trinidad and Tobago is a Caribbean nation so I think they might be part of the CONCACAF region for qualification purposes. I'm trying to recall if Trinidad and Tobago made it to any recent World Cups. I know that in 2014 they didn't qualify because their team wasn't strong enough. But what about 2018? Did anything change? Maybe there was a qualifying campaign where they performed better?Wait I think the 2018 World Cup qualifiers for CONCACAF had several rounds. There were groups and then maybe some playoffs. Trinidad and Tobago would have been competing against other teams like Mexico USA Costa Rica etc. But those are usually stronger teams. Did Trinidad manage to get through?I'm not sure about the exact results but I think they didn't qualify for 2018 either. They might have had some close matches but ultimately fell short. So putting it all together I don't believe Trinidad and Tobago were in the World Cup in 2018.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,137.58508930003154,0.05038667435895912,0.01479456506175601,0.0,0.0,0.0
67,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the boiling point is a characteristic property of matter. Hmm let's start by understanding what a characteristic property is. From what I remember in science class characteristic properties are traits that help identify substances because they don't change regardless of the amount you have. Examples include things like color density melting point and boiling point.Wait so if boiling point is one of those then it should be a characteristic property. But why do we consider it as such? Well when a substance boils at a specific temperature under standard pressure that's consistent for that substance. For example water always boils at 100°C at sea level. That doesn't change whether you have a little or a lot of water.But then I think about how external factors might affect it. Like if you add salt to water the boiling point increases. Does that mean it's not characteristic? No because in that case it's a mixture now not pure water. So for pure substances the boiling point is fixed and serves as an identifier.So putting it all together yes boiling point is a characteristic property because it's specific to each substance under standard conditions.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,133.13354249999975,0.04875107444559775,0.014314319249920153,0.0,0.0,0.0
68,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether North and South Korea speak the same language. Hmm I know that both countries are on the Korean peninsula but they've been separated for a long time. I think they have some differences because of their different political systems and histories.I remember hearing that the main language in both is Korean so at least the base is the same. But maybe there are regional dialects or differences in vocabulary due to the division. For example South Korea has been influenced more by Western culture especially through media and education which might have introduced new terms or changed some words.On the other hand North Korea has had less exposure to outside influences so their language might retain more traditional aspects or use different terminology especially in political contexts. There's also the possibility of differences in spelling or pronunciation because they've been separate for over 70 years.I wonder if people from both sides can understand each other without much difficulty. I think they probably can but there might be some confusion with specific terms or expressions that have evolved differently. So overall while there are some differences the core language is the same.</think>True,True,False,0,0.0,135.46448289998807,0.04960678753410007,0.014565574231978573,0.0,0.0,0.0

The White Witch kills him but then something happens that brings him back. I believe it's because of the magic in Narnia or some deeper power.Wait was it because he wasn't really dead? Or did he come back through a resurrection? I think it's the latter.

69,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether having six wisdom teeth is rare. Hmm let me think about this step by step.First I know that wisdom teeth are the third molars and they usually come in during a person's late teens or early twenties. Most people have four wisdom teeth—two on the top and two on the bottom. But sometimes people can have more or fewer than four. I've heard of cases where someone has supernumerary teeth which means extra teeth beyond the usual number. So having six wisdom teeth would mean having two extra ones. I wonder how common that is.From what I remember having more than four wisdom teeth isn't very common. It's possible but not typical. Some sources say that having six wisdom teeth is rare while others might mention it as a possibility in certain populations or genetic predispositions.I should also consider the structure of the jaw and how many teeth people typically have. The average adult has 32 teeth including four wisdom teeth. If someone has six wisdom teeth that would make their total number of teeth 34 which is more than usual. That might cause crowding or other dental issues.I think I've read before that having extra wisdom teeth can sometimes be associated with certain syndromes or genetic conditions but it's not a given. It could also just be an isolated occurrence in some families.So putting this all together while it's possible to have six wisdom teeth it's definitely not the norm. Most people either have four fewer or none at all. Therefore having six would be considered rare.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,134.03048950000084,0.0490741496976768,0.014409180796103482,0.0,0.0,0.0
72,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if there's a Grey's Anatomy Season 14. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. Grey's Anatomy has been on for quite some time now. I think it started in the mid-2000s and has had many seasons since then.I remember hearing that they've had several specials or movies especially around the pandemic when regular filming was difficult. But I'm not sure if those count as full seasons. Maybe Season 14 is one of those special episodes?Wait let me think about how TV shows typically release content. Usually a season consists of multiple episodes like 20-25 per season for dramas. If there's a Season 14 it should have that many episodes. But I don't recall hearing about a full Season 14 being released.I think the show has had some specials instead. For example during COVID-19 they did a special called ""Grey's Anatomy: In It Together"" which was like an extended episode or a movie. Maybe that's what people are referring to when they mention Season 14.So putting it all together I don't think there's an official Season 14 with multiple episodes. Instead there have been specials or movies that serve as additional content but aren't full seasons.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,124.9872329000209,0.045766731421514405,0.013438054689932416,0.0,0.0,0.0
71,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether cows have to keep getting pregnant to produce milk. Hmm let me think about this step by step.First I know that cows like many mammals produce milk after giving birth. So when a cow has a calf she starts lactating and produces milk for her baby. But does that mean she needs to get pregnant again right away to keep producing milk? Or can she continue without getting pregnant?I remember hearing something about dairy farming practices where cows are kept in a cycle of pregnancy and milking. So maybe they do need to get pregnant regularly to maintain milk production. But wait isn't there a period after giving birth when the cow naturally produces milk without needing another pregnancy? I think that's called lactation.So during lactation which is the period after giving birth cows produce milk for their calves. If they aren't impregnated again immediately can they still produce milk? Or does the body stop producing milk once the calf is weaned?I also recall that in dairy farming cows are often bred again while they're still lactating. This means they have a new calf every year or so which keeps their milk production going. Without getting pregnant again would their milk supply dwindle? I think after a certain period without pregnancy the cow's milk production decreases because her body isn't preparing for another calf.So putting it all together: cows do need to get pregnant regularly to maintain high levels of milk production. If they aren't impregnated again their lactation period ends and milk production drops. Therefore in order to keep producing milk at the levels required for dairy farming cows must continue getting pregnant.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,135.3501982000016,0.04956049603712083,0.014551982095315882,0.0,0.0,0.0
73,"<think>Okay so I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to have multiple foreign keys in a single table. Let me start by recalling what a foreign key is. From what I remember a foreign key is a column or set of columns in a database table that references the primary key of another table. It helps establish relationships between tables ensuring referential integrity.Now can there be more than one foreign key in a table? Well if each foreign key points to a different primary key in other tables then it makes sense that you could have multiple ones. For example imagine a table called ""Orders"" which might reference both the ""Customers"" table and the ""Products"" table. Each of these references would be a separate foreign key.Wait but does having multiple foreign keys cause any issues? I think as long as each foreign key is properly defined and points to the correct primary key in another table there shouldn't be a problem. It's just about how you design your database schema to reflect the necessary relationships between different entities.I should also consider normalization here. Normalization aims to reduce data redundancy and improve integrity by organizing data into separate tables. Having multiple foreign keys might be part of achieving higher normal forms like Third Normal Form (3NF) where each non-key attribute depends on the entire primary key.Let me think about a practical example. Suppose I have an ""Employee"" table with columns like EmployeeID DepartmentID and ManagerID. Both DepartmentID and ManagerID could be foreign keys pointing to other tables: ""Department"" for DepartmentID and another ""Employee"" table (since managers are also employees) for ManagerID. This setup allows each employee to belong to a department and have a manager both of which are references to other tables.Another example is an ""OrderDetails"" table that might reference the ""Orders"" table via OrderID and the ""Products"" table via ProductID. Each foreign key serves a different purpose but coexists within the same table without conflict.I wonder if there's any limitation on the number of foreign keys in a table. I think it depends on the database management system (DBMS) being used but generally most systems allow multiple foreign keys as long as they are correctly defined and don't create circular dependencies or other integrity issues.Also considering performance having multiple foreign keys might affect query execution plans because each join operation could be more complex. However this is a design consideration rather than a limitation on the number of foreign keys themselves.In summary yes it's possible to have multiple foreign keys in a table as long as each one correctly references another table's primary key and contributes to maintaining data integrity without causing logical inconsistencies.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,139.9744883000094,0.05126759613277636,0.015053221832873893,0.0,0.0,0.0
74,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether you have to pay to watch the ITV Hub. Let me start by recalling what I know about ITV and their streaming services. ITV is a major UK broadcaster right? They have various channels like ITV1 ITV2 etc. and they also offer on-demand content through something called the ITV Hub.I think the ITV Hub allows users to watch shows that have already aired on their TV channels. But I'm not entirely sure if it's free or requires a subscription. Maybe some parts are free while others aren't? Let me break this down.First I remember that many broadcasters offer free access to certain content as part of their strategy to attract viewers. So perhaps the ITV Hub has a free tier where you can watch shows after they've aired on TV. That makes sense because it's a way for them to keep people engaged without making them pay upfront.But then there might be premium content or exclusive shows that are only available with a subscription. For example some streaming services have both free and paid options where the paid version offers more content or better quality. So maybe the ITV Hub is similar—some content is free but to access everything you need to pay.Wait I also heard about something called ""ITV+ "" which might be a paid subscription service offering additional benefits like ad-free viewing or exclusive shows. If that's the case then while the basic ITV Hub might be free accessing more features would require payment.To confirm let me think about how other broadcasters operate. For instance BBC iPlayer is mostly free but requires a UK TV license which is a form of payment. However ITV doesn't require a TV license for their on-demand service so that's different. So the ITV Hub might be entirely free without needing any subscription beyond what's already provided by the broadcaster.But I'm still a bit confused because sometimes services have layers. Maybe some shows are behind a paywall or require a subscription to watch in full. Alternatively maybe it's completely free for everyone regardless of where they live as long as they're within the UK.I should also consider regional availability. If someone is outside the UK can they access the ITV Hub without paying? I think some services geo-block content so even if it's free in the UK international viewers might need a subscription or a VPN to access it.Putting this all together my understanding is that the basic ITV Hub service is free for UK residents. You don't have to pay to watch shows that are available on-demand through the hub. However there might be additional paid tiers or services like ITV+ that offer more content or perks but those aren't required just to use the hub itself.So in answer to whether you have to pay to watch the ITV Hub: No it's free. But if you want extra features or exclusive content then yes there might be a payment involved for those specific services.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,133.26750159997027,0.048813338967513165,0.014332601395591333,0.0,0.0,0.0

I think it's part of the Black Ops series which is known for its intense gameplay and story-driven campaigns. But does it have a zombie mode?I'm pretty sure that some Call of Duty games do include a zombie survival mode where players fight off waves of zombies. For example I remember Modern Warfare 2 had a zombie mode called ""Zombie"" or something like that. So maybe Black Ops 3 also has this.Wait but I think the main focus of Black Ops 3 was more on the campaign and multiplayer rather than additional modes. However I'm not entirely certain. Maybe there's an expansion pack or DLC that added a zombie mode later on?Alternatively perhaps the zombies are part of the campaign missions as enemies rather than a dedicated mode. But I think in some games like Black Ops II they had a zombie survival mode called ""Zombies"" where you play through different maps with friends.I should also consider looking up if there were any updates or DLCs for Black Ops 3 that included zombies. Maybe the base game didn't have it but later on they added it as an update.Wait I think I remember hearing about a zombie mode in Black Ops 3 called ""Zombies"" where you play through different eras and fight off hordes of zombies with various weapons and power-ups. So that would mean the answer is yes it does have zombies.But to be sure maybe I should check if other sources confirm this.

77,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the internal intercostal muscles contract during inspiration. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about breathing and the muscles involved.I remember that breathing involves both inhalation (inspiration) and exhalation (expiration). The main muscle for inspiration is the diaphragm which contracts and moves downward to increase the volume of the thoracic cavity. This decrease in pressure allows air to flow into the lungs.Now about the intercostal muscles. There are two types: external and internal. The external intercostal muscles are located between the ribs and help lift the rib cage during inspiration. They contract to pull the ribs upward and outward which also increases the thoracic volume aiding in taking a deeper breath.On the other hand the internal intercostal muscles are situated just beneath the external ones. I think these muscles play a role during expiration. When we exhale especially when it's forced (like blowing out) the internal intercostals contract to pull the rib cage downward and inward helping to decrease the thoracic volume and push air out of the lungs.Wait but sometimes during very deep breathing or certain movements maybe the internal intercostals could assist in some way? Or perhaps they are more involved in stabilizing the ribs rather than actively contracting during inspiration. I'm a bit fuzzy on that part.Let me think about how these muscles work together. During normal quiet breathing the diaphragm does most of the work for inspiration and the external intercostals assist by lifting the rib cage. The internal intercostals probably don't contract then because their main role is during expiration or forced exhalation.So putting it all together: during inspiration the external intercostal muscles contract to lift the ribs while the internal ones are either relaxed or not contracting. Therefore the answer should be False.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,129.6002218000067,0.04746242983029245,0.013935946657460577,0.0,0.0,0.0
78,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""log x"" is the same as ""ln x."" Hmm let's start by recalling what each of these stands for. I remember that ""ln x"" definitely stands for the natural logarithm of x. That's the logarithm with base e where e is approximately 2.71828. The natural log is commonly used in calculus and higher mathematics because it has nice properties when dealing with derivatives and integrals.Now what about ""log x""? I think this can be a bit ambiguous depending on the context. In many math classes especially in higher-level courses like college-level calculus or real analysis ""log x"" often refers to the natural logarithm as well. But wait that's not always the case everywhere. In some contexts particularly in engineering or older textbooks ""log x"" might refer to the base 10 logarithm. I remember learning that in high school sometimes ""log"" without a specified base was assumed to be base 10. So if someone writes ""log x "" it could mean either natural log or base 10 depending on where you are.But wait is there a standard convention? In mathematics especially in more advanced fields I think they usually use ""ln"" for natural logarithm and ""log"" might still be used for base e as well. However in computer science sometimes ""log"" can mean base 2 because binary systems are prevalent there.So putting this together the answer isn't straightforward. It depends on the context. If we're talking about a general math context without any specific field mentioned it's safer to say that they aren't necessarily the same because ""log x"" could be base 10 or another base depending on where you are. But in some contexts especially higher-level math they might both refer to natural logarithm.Wait but the question is asking if they're the same. Since there's ambiguity and it's not universally true that ""log x"" equals ""ln x "" I think the answer would be false because sometimes they can represent different bases.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,122.28239979999489,0.04477448091656641,0.01314670951107754,0.0,0.0,0.0
79,<think>Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether runs in Gin Rummy need to be of the same suit. I remember that Gin Rummy is a game where you try to form melds which can either be sets or runs. Sets are three or four cards of the same rank but different suits. Runs on the other hand are sequences of consecutive ranks.Wait so if it's a run does it have to be all in the same suit? I think that might not be the case because I've heard that runs can consist of any combination of suits as long as they form a sequence. For example you could have a 5 of hearts 6 of diamonds and 7 of clubs and that would still count as a run even though each card is from a different suit.But then again I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's a rule that requires runs to be in the same suit? Let me think about how Gin Rummy is played. The goal is to have all your cards in melds when you go gin or knock. Melds can be sets or runs. Sets are definitely same rank different suits. Runs are sequences of three or more consecutive ranks.I don't recall any mention that runs need to share the same suit. It makes sense because if they did it would be harder to form runs since you'd have limited cards in each suit. So I think runs can be made up of different suits as long as their ranks are consecutive.Wait but what about the rules? Let me try to recall or imagine the rulebook. In Gin Rummy a run is three or more consecutive cards regardless of suit. That means you don't need all the same suit for a run. So if I have 2 3 4 in different suits that's still a valid run.Therefore the answer should be False because runs do not have to be the same suit.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,119.39956359998905,0.0437254963155508,0.01283870603345278,0.0,0.0,0.0

Mountain lions on the other hand sound similar but I'm not certain if they're a separate species or just another name for the same animal.I think it's possible that ""mountain lion"" is another common name for the cougar. Maybe different regions use different terms to refer to the same creature. For example in some places people might call them cougars while others say mountain lions. I don't recall hearing about a separate species called a mountain lion; it seems more likely they're just alternative names.To double-check I can think about their scientific classification. The cougar is known scientifically as Puma concolor. If mountain lions are the same they should share this scientific name. I believe that's the case because both terms refer to the same big cat species without any subspecies distinction based on these common names.Also considering their habitats and physical characteristics cougars and mountain lions seem identical. They have similar appearances behaviors and ranges across North America. There doesn't appear to be a difference in size or other physical traits that would suggest they're separate animals.So putting it all together I think ""cougar"" and ""mountain lion"" are just two different names for the same animal species.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,117.87314820001484,0.0431513887123703,0.012670136220188406,0.0,0.0,0.0

Visas are typically required for entry into most countries unless there's an agreement in place that allows citizens of certain nations to enter without one.I remember that some Middle Eastern countries have different policies especially for tourists. Maybe Oman has a visa-on-arrival option or perhaps they allow stays up to a certain number of days without a visa. I think some countries offer e-visas now which you can apply for online before traveling.Let me consider my nationality because that plays a big role in whether a visa is needed. If I'm from the United States Canada Australia or many European countries Oman might have specific rules. I believe Oman has agreements with several countries where tourists can get a visa upon arrival without needing to apply beforehand.Wait but how long can you stay? I think it's usually around 30 days for most nationalities when getting a visa on arrival. So if someone is planning a short trip they might not need to arrange a visa in advance. However if the visit is longer or for work purposes then a different type of visa would be required.I should also check if there are any exceptions or recent changes in Oman's visa policies. Sometimes countries update their requirements so it's good to verify the latest information. Maybe I can look up the official Oman tourism website or the embassy's page for accurate details.Another point is whether a passport is valid for at least six months beyond the intended stay. That’s a common requirement even if you don't need a visa upfront. So ensuring my passport is in order is important regardless of the visa situation.In summary based on what I know many tourists can enter Oman without needing to apply for a visa beforehand because they can get it upon arrival.

I think they used to have an internet service provider called Time Warner Cable as well. But then there was some restructuring or merger involving these companies.So if Comcast acquired Time Warner Cable does that mean they're the same company now? Or is Time Warner still a separate entity? Let me break it down. Time Warner Cable was a subsidiary of Time Warner right? So when Comcast bought Time Warner Cable they took over their operations but didn't merge with Time Warner itself.Time Warner later rebranded as WarnerMedia after spinning off some assets and focusing more on media properties like HBO Max. Meanwhile Comcast continued to operate under its own name managing services like Xfinity. They also have other ventures such as NBCUniversal which they acquired separately.So even though there was a merger involving Time Warner Cable into Comcast the parent company Time Warner is still distinct from Comcast.

84,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the Falkland Islands are part of the Commonwealth. Hmm let's start by recalling what the Commonwealth is. From what I remember it's a political association of member states that were once territories of the British Empire. The Commonwealth doesn't have a centralized government but promotes cooperation among its members.Now the Falkland Islands—where are they? They're located in the South Atlantic Ocean right? I think they're a British Overseas Territory. That means they're under British sovereignty but aren't part of the United Kingdom itself. So being a British Overseas Territory does that automatically make them part of the Commonwealth?Wait not necessarily. The Commonwealth includes countries that have voluntarily joined and are members. Some territories might be associated with the UK but not necessarily part of the Commonwealth. For example Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory but isn't in the Commonwealth.I should check if the Falkland Islands have any specific status within the Commonwealth. Maybe they participate in some Commonwealth events or organizations. I recall that sometimes territories can associate with the Commonwealth through their respective countries. Since the Falklands are under the UK perhaps the UK represents them in Commonwealth matters.But do they have a separate membership? Or is it that only sovereign states can be members of the Commonwealth? Yes I think membership is open to sovereign nations and territories might not be full members but could have some form of associate status. Wait let me think again. The Falkland Islands are self-governing in many aspects under British sovereignty. Do they participate in the Commonwealth as a member or just through the UK? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe they don't have their own membership because they're not an independent country.So putting it all together: The Falkland Islands are a British Overseas Territory not an independent nation. Since Commonwealth membership is for sovereign states the Falklands aren't part of the Commonwealth themselves but are under the UK's representation.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,112.57367829998839,0.041208180197211515,0.012099570189152796,0.0,0.0,0.0
86,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Murphy Brown had a baby on the show. Let me start by recalling what I know about the TV series ""Murphy Brown."" It's a sitcom that aired from 1987 to 1998 starring Candice Bergen as the titular character. Murphy is a news anchor who works at a fictional TV station.I remember that Murphy had some significant life events throughout the series. She went through several relationships and career challenges. One of her main storylines was her struggle with infertility. I think she tried different methods to conceive including in vitro fertilization (IVF). Wait did she actually have a baby on the show? Or did she adopt? I'm a bit fuzzy on that part. Let me try to remember specific episodes. There was an episode where she gave birth but I might be mixing it up with another character or another show. Alternatively maybe she adopted a child towards the end of the series.I think in one of the later seasons Murphy does have a child. The baby's name was something like Jake if I'm not mistaken. But I'm not entirely sure if that happened on the show or if it was just part of her storyline off-screen. Another angle: the show dealt with her personal life extensively so having a child would make sense as a major plot point. It would tie into her character development and the themes of career vs. family. So considering all this I believe Murphy Brown did have a baby on the show.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,112.28798120000283,0.04110824837929456,0.012070228149799706,0.0,0.0,0.0
85,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether a Quarter Pounder weighs a quarter of a pound. Hmm I remember that McDonald's has different burger sizes and the names often reflect their size or ingredients. The Quarter Pounder is one of their classic burgers.Wait but does it actually weigh a quarter pound? I think in some places especially in the US they might use ounces more commonly than pounds for food items. Let me recall: 16 ounces make a pound so a quarter pound would be 4 ounces. But when I look at the burger it seems bigger than that. Maybe it's not just the meat patty but also includes other ingredients like the bun lettuce tomato and sauce.Oh right sometimes the name refers only to the meat patty. So if the Quarter Pounder has a 4-ounce beef patty then the total weight of the burger would be more than that because it includes all the toppings and the bun. But does the question specify whether it's just the patty or the whole burger? The question is a bit ambiguous.I think in most cases when they name a burger like that they're referring to the meat portion. So if the patty is a quarter pound then yes but the entire burger would weigh more. However sometimes fast food chains might adjust their sizes for different regions or over time. I should check if there have been changes in the Quarter Pounder's size.Wait I think McDonald's has had some variations. For example in the US the original Quarter Pounder is 4 ounces of beef but in other countries it might be slightly different due to portion sizes or dietary standards. Also over time they might have increased the patty size for value perception.But sticking to the original question: does a Quarter Pounder weigh a quarter pound? If we're talking about just the meat then yes it's a quarter pound. But if considering the whole burger no it's more than that. Since the question doesn't specify I might have to assume they mean the entire burger.Alternatively maybe in some contexts like when they introduced the Double Quarter Pounder each patty is a quarter pound so two would make half a pound. But that's a different product.I think the key here is whether the name refers to the total weight or just the meat. If it's just the meat then yes but if it's the entire burger no. Since the question doesn't specify I might have to go with the common understanding which is that the Quarter Pounder refers to the meat patty being a quarter pound.Wait but sometimes people think of the whole burger as a quarter pound which isn't accurate because the bun and toppings add weight. So maybe the answer is no it doesn't weigh a quarter pound in total.I'm getting confused now. Let me try to find some information. I recall that McDonald's Quarter Pounder has a 4-ounce beef patty which is a quarter pound. The entire burger would be more than that because of the bun and toppings. So if someone asks if it weighs a quarter pound they might mean the whole burger in which case the answer is no.But maybe the question is just about the meat. It's unclear. Since the user didn't specify I have to make an assumption. In most cases when people refer to the Quarter Pounder they're talking about the meat portion being a quarter pound. So if the question is asking whether it weighs a quarter pound in total then no. But if it's just the meat yes.Wait but the way the question is phrased: ""does a quarter pounder weight a quarter pound."" It doesn't specify so I think they're referring to the entire burger. Therefore the answer would be false because the whole burger weighs more than a quarter pound.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,121.09250999998767,0.04432777143760954,0.013015546410233688,0.0,0.0,0.0

Let me think.First the FIFA World Cup is the biggest international soccer tournament for men's teams. It happens every four years. The United States has participated in several World Cups right? But have they ever won it?I remember hearing that Brazil has won it multiple times like five or six times. Germany and Italy also have a few titles each. Then there are countries like Argentina France England Spain who have won as well. I don't recall the US being among those winners.Wait maybe in the women's World Cup? Oh right the US has been really successful in women's soccer. They've won multiple times but that's a different competition. The question is about men's soccer so that doesn't count.I think the US men's team made it to the quarterfinals or semifinals in some tournaments maybe in 1930 or later years like 2014. But winning the whole thing? I don't think they've ever reached the final let alone won it.So putting it all together the answer should be False because the US has never won the men's World Cup in soccer.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,117.02654370001983,0.04286153039015592,0.01258502784855543,0.0,0.0,0.0
89,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""fitness"" as used in biology and ""survival"" mean the same thing. Hmm let me start by recalling what each term means.Fitness in biology refers to an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its environment. It's not just about living longer but also about passing on genes successfully. So it includes both survival and reproductive success.Survival on the other hand is more straightforward—it's about whether an organism lives or dies. But does that cover everything fitness entails? I don't think so because fitness goes beyond just surviving; it's also about how well an organism can reproduce.So if two organisms survive equally but one has more offspring the latter has higher fitness. That means survival is a part of fitness but not the whole story. Therefore they don't have the same meaning.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,112.87595399998827,0.041335606488000394,0.012136985171856832,0.0,0.0,0.0
88,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Illinois has a ""stand your ground"" law. I'm not entirely sure what that means but from what I remember it's related to self-defense laws. Let me think about this step by step.First I know that ""stand your ground"" is a legal principle that allows people to use force in self-defense without retreating even if they could safely escape the situation. It's different from the ""duty to retreat"" which requires someone to avoid conflict if possible before using deadly force.Now does Illinois have this? I'm not certain. I think some states have adopted stand your ground laws while others follow the duty to retreat approach. Maybe I can recall any specific cases or news about Illinois and self-defense laws.I remember hearing that some states in the South have stand your ground laws like Florida but I'm not sure about Midwestern states like Illinois. Perhaps Illinois follows a more traditional approach where you must try to escape if possible before using deadly force.Wait there's also something called the ""Castle Doctrine "" which allows people to use deadly force without retreating in their own homes. Maybe Illinois has that but not necessarily stand your ground outside the home. So does that mean they don't have a full stand your ground law?I should check if Illinois has any specific statutes about this. From what I recall Illinois doesn't explicitly have a stand your ground law. Instead it requires retreat if possible unless you're in your own home or certain other places where retreat isn't feasible.So putting it all together: Stand your ground allows for no duty to retreat anywhere while Illinois might require retreat except in specific circumstances like the Castle Doctrine. Therefore Illinois doesn't have a stand your ground law as such.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,121.89624689999619,0.04463388465237235,0.01310542755300981,0.0,0.0,0.0
90,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Britain has the right to bear arms. Hmm I'm not too familiar with British laws on this topic but I know a bit about the US because of the Second Amendment there. In the US people have the right to bear arms as per their Constitution. But Britain is different; they don't have a written constitution like the US does.I remember hearing that in the UK gun control is much stricter than in the US. I think you need a license to own a firearm and even then it's not easy to get one. There are specific categories of firearms that are banned or require special permits. So maybe Britain doesn't have an explicit right to bear arms like the US does.Wait but what about self-defense? In some countries people can own guns for protection but in the UK I think it's more regulated. You might need a good reason like if you're a farmer and need a shotgun for pest control or something like that. But for personal defense it's probably harder to get a license.Also there was some recent legislation after certain incidents where they banned certain types of firearms. So the laws are pretty tight. I don't think there's a constitutional right in Britain that guarantees the right to bear arms. Instead it's more about regulation and control to prevent misuse.So putting this together I don't believe Britain has an explicit right to bear arms like the US does. Their approach is more about controlling firearms rather than ensuring a right to own them.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,122.36385560000781,0.04481369833528324,0.013158224552705943,0.0,0.0,0.0

It's the supreme law of the land outlining the structure of government and the fundamental rights of citizens. The original document was written in 1787 and has been amended over time with the Bill of Rights and other amendments.Now the Civil Rights Act—I remember that there have been several Civil Rights Acts passed by Congress. For example the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a significant piece of legislation that addressed issues like discrimination in public places employment and education. But wait isn't that an act passed by Congress rather than being part of the Constitution itself?The Constitution includes amendments related to civil rights such as the 13th Amendment which abolished slavery the 14th Amendment which addresses citizenship and equal protection under the law and the 15th Amendment about voting rights. These are all part of the Constitution.However the Civil Rights Act is a statute enacted by Congress not an amendment to the Constitution. So while it's related to civil rights it's not part of the Constitution itself but rather federal legislation that implements and enforces constitutional principles.Therefore the answer should be False because the Civil Rights Act isn't in the Constitution; it's a separate law passed by Congress.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,114.36276570003247,0.041884641930231566,0.012298193282426543,0.0,0.0,0.0
92,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether thread seal tape and Teflon tape are the same thing. Let me start by recalling what each of these tapes is used for.Thread seal tape also known as plumber's tape or PTFE tape is commonly used in plumbing to create a watertight seal on pipe threads. It helps prevent leaks by filling the gaps between the threads and providing a smooth surface for the joint.Teflon tape specifically refers to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape which is known for its non-stick properties and resistance to heat and chemicals. It's often used in various applications beyond plumbing such as sealing electrical connections or protecting surfaces from adhesives.Wait a minute so thread seal tape is made of Teflon? That would mean they are the same thing. But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes products can have similar uses but different materials or applications. Let me think about their composition and usage.Thread seal tape is indeed made from PTFE which is Teflon. So in essence thread seal tape is a type of Teflon tape designed specifically for sealing pipe threads. However not all Teflon tapes are used as thread sealants; some might be used for different purposes where non-stick or heat resistance is needed.So while they are made from the same material their primary uses differ slightly. But in terms of being the same product when it comes to sealing pipe threads yes they can be considered the same.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,122.20607000001473,0.04475318289006182,0.013140455971965899,0.0,0.0,0.0
93,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Hawaii was once known as the Sandwich Islands. Hmm I remember hearing something about that in history class but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think through this step by step.First I know that Hawaii is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Before it became a U.S. state it was an independent kingdom. Now the term ""Sandwich Islands"" sounds familiar but I'm not certain about its origin or usage.I think the name might have something to do with Captain James Cook. He was an explorer who charted many places around the world. When he arrived in Hawaii which was then called Oceania by some he named them after someone. Wait wasn't it after the Earl of Sandwich? That makes sense because a lot of places were named after nobles or sponsors back then.So Captain Cook named the islands the Sandwich Islands in honor of John Montagu the 4th Earl of Sandwich. This was during his third voyage in 1778. Before that the native Hawaiians had their own name for the islands which was ""Hawaii."" But after Cook's arrival the European name took hold especially among explorers and traders.Over time as more people from Europe and other parts of the world came to Hawaii the term Sandwich Islands became less common. The name Hawaii started to be used more frequently both locally and internationally. By the 19th century the Sandwich Islands were referred to as Hawaii in most official documents and maps.I also recall that when Hawaii was annexed by the United States in 1898 it was already known as Hawaii not the Sandwich Islands. So the term ""Sandwich Islands"" is more of a historical name rather than the current one.To double-check I can think about other places named after people or titles. For example Newfoundland was named by John Cabot when he claimed it for England. Similarly Cook named these islands after someone significant back home to gain favor and recognition.So putting it all together: Yes Hawaii used to be called the Sandwich Islands especially during the time of European exploration in the late 18th century. The name was given by Captain James Cook in honor of the Earl of Sandwich.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,111.88778750001802,0.04096645560620267,0.012028594872083258,0.0,0.0,0.0
95,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether a batter gets an RBI on a fielder's choice. Hmm let me think about what each of these terms means.First an RBI stands for Runs Batted In. That happens when a batter hits the ball and as a result one or more runners score. So if a runner scores because of the batter's action that counts as an RBI.Now a fielder's choice is a play where the fielder chooses to make an out on a different runner instead of trying to get the batter out. For example if there are runners on base and the batter hits the ball the fielder might decide to tag out a runner who's closer to scoring rather than try to catch the batter. In this case the batter is safe at first but another runner is out.So in a fielder's choice situation does the batter get credit for an RBI? Well if the play results in a runner being forced out or tagged out because of the fielder's decision then any runners who were able to score before that would count. But wait in a fielder's choice usually the batter is safe but another runner is out. So does that mean that any runs scored on that play are attributed to the batter?I think so. Because even though the batter didn't get an extra base hit their action still led to runners scoring. The key here is whether a run was scored as a result of the batter's plate appearance. If a runner scores because of the fielder's choice then yes the batter should get an RBI.Wait but sometimes in a fielder's choice especially if it's a double play or something maybe no runs are scored. So it depends on whether any runners actually crossed home plate during that play. If they did then the batter gets the RBI; if not then they don't.So putting it all together: Yes a batter can get an RBI on a fielder's choice if a runner scores as a result of that play.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,119.22722470000735,0.04366286596263135,0.012820316472266297,0.0,0.0,0.0
94,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""The Tale of Despereaux"" is a Disney movie. Let me start by recalling what I know about this title. I remember there was a book called ""The Tale of Despereaux"" written by Kate DiCamillo. It's a children's novel and it won some awards maybe the Newbery Medal? Yeah that sounds right.Now did Disney make a movie based on this book? I'm not entirely sure. I know Disney has adapted several books into movies like ""The Lion King"" from ""The Jungle Book "" but I don't recall ""Despereaux"" being one of them. Wait maybe it's an animated film or a live-action adaptation?Let me think about the release dates. The book came out in 2003 so if Disney made a movie it might have been around that time or later. I don't remember any big Disney movies from that era with a mouse as the main character. There was ""The Rescuers"" and ""The Rescuers Down Under "" but those are different.Alternatively maybe it's a lesser-known Disney project or perhaps a direct-to-video release? Sometimes Disney makes animated films that aren't as widely publicized. I'm trying to remember if there was an animated version of ""Despereaux."" I think I've heard the name before in the context of animation but I can't place it exactly.Wait wasn't there a movie called ""The Tale of Despereaux"" that came out around 2008 or so? If I recall correctly it was an animated film produced by DreamWorks not Disney. That would make sense because DreamWorks has done other animated movies like ""Shrek."" So if that's the case then it's not a Disney movie.To double-check I can think about the voice actors involved. I believe Matthew Broderick and Dustin Hoffman were part of the cast for that movie. If it was a Disney production they might have different voice talent or perhaps more Disney regulars. But I'm not certain about that.Another angle: looking at the animation style. Disney has its own distinct style often with more rounded characters and vibrant colors. ""The Tale of Despereaux "" if I remember correctly had a unique art style with watercolor elements which might be more in line with DreamWorks' approach rather than Disney's.Also considering the themes of the story—friendship courage and a bit of fantasy—it fits well within both studios' genres. But without specific knowledge it's hard to say for sure. However I'm leaning towards it being a DreamWorks production because I don't recall any major Disney campaigns or releases around that time with that title.So putting it all together: the book is by Kate DiCamillo and while there was an animated movie adaptation it was produced by DreamWorks not Disney. Therefore ""The Tale of Despereaux"" is not a Disney movie.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,123.19284470001003,0.045116096336412295,0.013247014832262333,0.0,0.0,0.0

I think the last time they made new $2 bills was a while back perhaps in the early 2000s. Wait wasn't there a series from 2003 or something around that time?I should check if the U.S. Treasury continued producing them after that. Maybe they stopped because people don't use them much. Or maybe they still make some for collectors or specific orders. I'm not sure about the exact years.Also considering the question is about 2018 which isn't too long ago but if production stopped before then it's possible they weren't making new $2 bills that year. Alternatively perhaps they do print them periodically even if it's infrequent.I think I've heard that the $2 bill is still legal tender and can be obtained from banks but whether they were actively printed in 2018 is unclear to me.

96,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the County Court Business Centre is a real court. Hmm let me think about this step by step.First what do I know about courts? There are different types like criminal courts civil courts family courts etc. The term ""County Court"" makes me think of a specific level or type of court in some jurisdictions. For example in the UK there's the County Court which handles civil matters. But then there's this ""Business Centre"" part. That sounds more like an administrative office rather than a courtroom.Wait maybe it's not a traditional court but a service center? I've heard terms like ""court business centers"" before especially in places where they handle filings document submissions and other administrative tasks related to court cases. So perhaps the County Court Business Centre isn't where trials or hearings take place but rather where people go to file papers pay fees or get information about their cases.I should also consider if there's a specific location or jurisdiction that refers to such a center as a ""County Court Business Centre."" Maybe in some areas they have these centers to support the court system without being courts themselves. They might assist with scheduling case management and providing resources to litigants.Another angle: sometimes government services use similar names for different purposes. So it's possible that while there is a County Court the Business Centre attached to it isn't an actual courtroom but rather a support facility. This would mean that while it's part of the court system it doesn't function as a place where legal proceedings occur.I should also think about whether I've heard of any real places with this exact name. Maybe in some regions they have such centers. But without specific knowledge I can only go by general understanding. So based on that I'd say the County Court Business Centre is likely not a court itself but an administrative support center for the court system.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,125.12443040002836,0.04581070310696351,0.013450965682164555,0.0,0.0,0.0
98,"<think>Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether quantum entanglement can transfer information faster than the speed of light. Hmm I remember from my basic physics classes that quantum entanglement is this phenomenon where particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one instantly influences the state of another no matter the distance between them. But wait isn't there something about how this doesn't actually allow for faster-than-light communication?Let me think. When two particles are entangled if you measure one the other's state is determined immediately. That seems like it could be instantaneous which would imply a speed faster than light. But I've also heard that you can't use this to send information because the outcomes are random. So even though the states are connected instantly you can't control what the outcome will be when you measure them.So if Alice and Bob have entangled particles and Alice measures hers Bob's particle will collapse into a corresponding state. But without some classical communication Bob doesn't know what Alice did or what the result was. He just has a random state that's correlated with Alice's. So he can't actually send a message faster than light because there's no way to encode information in the randomness.Also I think Einstein talked about this as ""spooky action at a distance "" but it doesn't violate relativity because you can't transmit actual information faster than light. Relativity only prohibits information transfer exceeding light speed not just any influence that isn't usable for communication.So putting it all together: quantum entanglement does involve instantaneous effects but these can't be used to send messages or information faster than light. Therefore the answer should be False.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,119.39029819998541,0.04370878060125253,0.012833797955555485,0.0,0.0,0.0
99,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""World at War"" is part of ""Black Ops."" Let me start by recalling what I know about these games.First ""Call of Duty: World at War"" was released in 2008. It's a WWII game and it's the fifth mainline title in the Call of Duty series. The gameplay focuses on different campaigns across various theaters of war including Europe North Africa and the Pacific. I remember playing it; it had some intense moments especially the campaign where you play as a Soviet soldier during the Battle of Stalingrad.Now ""Black Ops"" is another sub-series within Call of Duty. The first ""Black Ops"" game came out in 2010 titled ""Call of Duty: Black Ops."" It's set during the Cold War era and involves secret operations which gives it a more espionage feel compared to the typical WWII or modern warfare settings.So are they connected? I don't think so. World at War is firmly rooted in WWII history while Black Ops deals with Cold War scenarios. The gameplay styles also differ; World at War has a more traditional war feel whereas Black Ops introduced elements like zombies and had a different narrative structure.I should check if there's any crossover or mention of each other. From what I recall the two series are separate but both part of the larger Call of Duty universe. They don't share characters or storylines. World at War is more about historical accuracy while Black Ops takes creative liberties with Cold War events and adds supernatural elements like zombies.Therefore ""World at War"" isn't part of the ""Black Ops"" series. They are distinct games within the broader Call of Duty franchise.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,118.36376159999054,0.04333403020569775,0.012723763523247925,0.0,0.0,0.0

It's more of a marketing term used by some companies to sound fancy. They might use other types of leather and just call it Corinthian for branding purposes. So in reality there's no specific leather named Corinthian.I should double-check this. Maybe look up if any leather manufacturers actually produce something called Corinthian leather. If I search online do I find genuine sources that confirm its existence? Or is it just a term used without an actual product?From what I recall the term was popularized by a car company in their ads to emphasize luxury and quality. But upon closer inspection it's not a recognized type of leather in the industry. So it's more of a marketing ploy than an authentic material.Therefore putting it all together there isn't an actual thing called Corinthian leather.

100,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether tonic water and quinine water are the same thing. Let me start by recalling what I know about both.Tonic water is something I've heard of before especially in the context of cocktails like a Gin & Tonic. It's usually a carbonated drink that has a bitter taste. From what I remember it contains quinine which gives it that bitterness. Quinine itself is a natural compound derived from the bark of the cinchona tree. Historically it was used as a medication to treat malaria because of its antimalarial properties.Now quinine water—does that refer to the same thing? Well if tonic water contains quinine then maybe they are the same. But I should double-check. Maybe there's a difference in concentration or other ingredients. Tonic water might have added sugar and carbonation whereas quinine water could be just the quinine solution without the fizz or sweetness.Wait but isn't quinine water another name for tonic water? Or is it more of an alternative term? I think in some places people might refer to tonic water as quinine water because of its main active ingredient. However I'm not entirely sure if they are exactly the same or if there's a variation.I should consider the purpose each serves. Tonic water is primarily a beverage often used in mixed drinks while quinine water could be more about the medicinal aspect though that's less common now since synthetic antimalarials have taken over. But in terms of composition both contain quinine as their key component.So putting it all together: tonic water contains quinine and is carbonated with added sugar whereas quinine water might just refer to a solution containing quinine without the other additives. However in many contexts especially in beverages they are used interchangeably. Therefore I think they are essentially the same thing but perhaps with slight variations depending on the product.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,121.6714067000139,0.04453880357094474,0.013077509789767459,0.0,0.0,0.0
102,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out if any of the original members of Lynyrd Skynyrd are still alive. First I should recall who the original members were. From what I remember Lynyrd Skynyrd was a Southern rock band that became popular in the 1970s with hits like ""Free Bird"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama."" The main members included Ronnie Van Zant as the lead vocalist Gary Rossington on guitar Allen Collins on guitar and vocals Larry Junstrom on drums and Bob Burns on bass. I think there was a plane crash in 1977 that took down several band members. I believe Ronnie Van Zant Steve Gaines (who was actually a backup singer at the time) and Cassie Gaines were killed in that crash. That would leave Gary Rossington Allen Collins Larry Junstrom and Bob Burns as survivors. Wait but I'm not entirely sure about all of them. Let me think again. After the plane crash the band continued with some changes. I know that Gary Rossington is still alive; he's been active in the band for a long time. Allen Collins was also part of the original lineup and I believe he survived the crash as well. Larry Junstrom might have left the band after the crash or maybe later on but I think he's still alive. Bob Burns the bassist I'm not sure about his current status. I should check if any of these members have passed away since then. From what I recall Allen Collins died in 2016 from cancer. Larry Junstrom also passed away a few years ago maybe around 2018 or so. Bob Burns as far as I know is still alive and has been involved with the band in some capacity even after the original lineup changed.So putting it all together: Ronnie Van Zant died in 1977 Steve Gaines too Cassie Gaines as well. Allen Collins died in 2016 Larry Junstrom passed away around 2018. That leaves Gary Rossington and Bob Burns as the original members still alive. Therefore yes some of the original members are still alive.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,124.6252383000101,0.04563835737232203,0.013400361425846613,0.0,0.0,0.0
103,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether there's a playoff for third place in the World Cup. Hmm I remember watching some World Cup games before but I'm not entirely sure about all the details. Let me think through this step by step.First what is the structure of the World Cup? It starts with group stages where teams are divided into groups and play against each other. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Then it's a single-elimination tournament: quarterfinals semifinals and then the final for the championship.Wait but what happens after the semifinals? If a team loses in the semifinal they don't get eliminated immediately; instead there's another match. I think that's called the third-place playoff or the bronze medal match. So the two teams that lost in the semifinals play against each other to determine who gets third place.I'm pretty sure this is how it works because I've seen it on TV before. The teams that lose their semifinal matches don't just go home without playing again; they have one more game to compete for the bronze medal. That makes sense because it gives those teams a chance to end their World Cup journey on a positive note and also adds another match for viewers.But wait is this always the case? I should double-check if there are any exceptions or changes in recent tournaments. From what I recall even in the most recent World Cups like 2018 and 2022 they still had the third-place playoff. So it seems consistent over the years.Another point to consider: why have a third-place match? It's probably for both the teams and the fans. For the teams it's an opportunity to finish higher than fourth place which can be important for rankings and future tournaments. For fans it adds another game to watch keeping interest high even after the final.I don't think there was a time when they skipped this match. Maybe in the very early days of the World Cup but I believe since the tournament became more structured the third-place playoff has been a standard part of it.So putting it all together: yes there is a playoff for third place in the World Cup. The two semifinal losers compete to determine who gets the bronze medal.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,124.24334889999591,0.045482780526736884,0.013354680860629808,0.0,0.0,0.0
104,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether New Hampshire has a sales tax. Hmm I remember hearing that some states don't have a sales tax but I'm not sure which ones. Let me think about this step by step.First I know that sales taxes vary from state to state in the U.S. Some states rely heavily on sales taxes for their revenue while others might have different structures. New Hampshire is one of the smaller states so maybe it has a unique tax system.I recall that some states like Alaska and Montana don't have a general sales tax. Wait does New Hampshire fall into that category? I think I've heard something about New Hampshire not having a state income tax either but what about sales tax?Let me try to remember any specific information. I believe New Hampshire does collect some form of sales tax but perhaps it's structured differently. Maybe it's called something else or applies only to certain goods and services.Wait no actually I think New Hampshire is one of the few states without a general state sales tax. Instead they might have local taxes or other revenue sources. But I'm not entirely sure. I should double-check this information because getting it wrong could be misleading.Alternatively maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps New Hampshire does have a sales tax but at a very low rate making it seem like there isn't one. Or maybe they only tax specific items which might make the overall impact less noticeable compared to other states.I'm leaning towards the idea that New Hampshire doesn't have a state-level sales tax. But I need to confirm this because my memory could be fuzzy. If I were to look it up I'd check reliable sources like the official New Hampshire government website or reputable financial websites that outline state taxes.In summary based on what I remember and some reasoning I think the answer is that there's no sales tax in New Hampshire. But I'm not 100% certain without verifying.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,124.78763989999425,0.045699100087338476,0.013418196737677997,0.0,0.0,0.0
105,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether San Luis Rey de Francia was always a mission. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about missions in California. The Spanish established a series of missions along the coast right? They were part of the effort to colonize and convert Native Americans to Christianity.San Luis Rey de Francia sounds familiar. I think it's one of the missions in Southern California. Wait wasn't there a mission named San Luis Rey? Yes Mission San Luis Rey de Francia is one of the 21 missions in California. It was founded by the Franciscans if I remember correctly.Now the question is whether it was always a mission. So did it serve only as a mission from its establishment until now? Missions typically served as religious centers places where converts were educated and worked. But over time some missions might have changed their functions or faced challenges.I think after the Mexican secularization laws in the 1830s many missions were either abandoned or repurposed. So did San Luis Rey de Francia continue to function as a mission during that period? Or was it used for something else?Wait I recall that some missions became parish churches or were used by the military at times. But Mission San Luis Rey specifically... I think it remained under church control and continued its missionary work even after secularization. It might have faced difficulties but didn't change its primary function.So putting this together: was it always a mission? If it started as one and continued to operate as such without changing its main purpose then the answer would be true. But if at any point it wasn't functioning as a mission then false.I think San Luis Rey de Francia did face some challenges but remained operational as a mission throughout. So I'm leaning towards True.</think>True,True,False,0,0.0,115.61312569997972,0.04232658727848956,0.012427957536402964,0.0,0.0,0.0

But wait does she also do other voices? Or did someone else handle some parts?I think in the original 2013 movie Kristen Bell definitely voiced Anna. She was one of the main characters alongside Elsa. Now when it comes to singing I believe she sang her own songs. The big hit ""Let It Go"" is sung by Idina Menzel as Elsa but Anna's songs like ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"" are performed by Kristen Bell.But wait did she do all the voices? Or were there other voice actors for different parts? I don't recall any other actresses taking over Anna's voice. It seems like Kristen Bell was consistent in voicing Anna throughout the movie and maybe even in some of the sequels or shorts.I should also consider if there were any特殊情况 like if she couldn't perform a part and someone else took over. But from what I know that didn't happen. So yes Kristen Bell sang all the voices for Anna in Frozen.</think>True",True,False,0,0.0,117.34641779999947,0.04295292571640008,0.01261186339818561,0.0,0.0,0.0
107,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if there's going to be a Season 4 of Total Bellas. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. Total Bellas is a reality TV series that focuses on the lives of professional wrestlers specifically the Bella Twins Brie and Nikki Bella. The show has been running for a few seasons now but I'm not exactly sure how many.I think Season 1 was when they first started documenting their lives then Season 2 followed. After that there was Season 3 which I believe wrapped up recently. Now the question is about Season 4. To find out if it's happening I should check recent news or announcements from WWE or the Bella Twins themselves.I'll try to remember any interviews or statements they've made. I think Brie and Nikki have been pretty active on social media so maybe they've hinted at a new season. Alternatively WWE often announces their programming plans in advance so perhaps there's an official announcement about Season 4.Another angle is looking into the show's popularity. If Seasons 1-3 were well-received it's more likely that there will be another season. I should consider ratings and fan reception. If the show has a strong following networks are more inclined to renew it for additional seasons.I also wonder if there have been any behind-the-scenes developments or changes in the Bella Twins' careers that might affect the continuation of the series. For instance if they're focusing on other projects maybe the show isn't as much of a priority anymore.To sum up I need to verify whether WWE has confirmed Season 4 check for any recent updates from the Bella Twins assess the show's popularity and ratings and consider any external factors that might influence its renewal. Based on this information I can determine if there will be a Season 4 of Total Bellas.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,119.07214220002061,0.04358216382060304,0.012796620661696321,0.0,0.0,0.0
108,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if there's going to be a 14th season of Grey's Anatomy. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. It's been on for quite some time now right? I think it started in 2005 or something like that. So counting from then each season is one year so up to 2023 would be around 18 seasons. Wait but the user is asking about a 14th season which seems a bit low if we're already at 18.Wait maybe I'm mixing up something. Let me check my facts. Grey's Anatomy first aired in April 2005 so that was Season 1. Each subsequent year adds a new season. So as of now in 2023 the show is on its 19th season. That means there have been multiple seasons beyond 14.But wait maybe the user is asking about future plans? Like has ABC or the production team announced a 14th season? I think they've already passed that. So if someone is asking about a 14th season now it's definitely in the past because we're way beyond that.Alternatively perhaps there was some confusion or misinformation where people thought the show might end at Season 13 or something. But no the show has continued well beyond that. I remember hearing that Ellen Pompeo and others have been involved for many seasons so it's unlikely they stopped at 14.Also considering the popularity of Grey's Anatomy it's improbable that ABC would cancel it after just 13 seasons. The show has a massive fan base and consistently good ratings which usually leads to renewals.So putting this all together I think the answer is False because there have been more than 14 seasons already.</think>False,False,True,0,0.0,120.20207369999844,0.043997385840748346,0.01291853839630111,0.0,0.0,0.0
109,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the October Revolution and the Bolshevik Revolution are the same thing. Let me start by recalling what each term refers to.The October Revolution—I remember it happened in 1917 in Russia. It was a pivotal event where the Bolsheviks led by Lenin overthrew the provisional government. This revolution is often seen as the beginning of the Soviet Union and the establishment of communist rule in Russia.Now the Bolshevik Revolution—Bolsheviks were a faction within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. They were the more radical group compared to the Mensheviks. The term ""Bolshevik Revolution"" might be used interchangeably with the October Revolution because it was their revolution. But I should check if there's any difference in how these terms are used historically.I think sometimes people use both terms to refer to the same event but maybe not always. For example some sources might use ""October Revolution"" specifically referring to the events of that month while ""Bolshevik Revolution"" could be a broader term encompassing their rise to power over time. However in most contexts especially in historical discussions they are treated as the same event.I should also consider if there were other revolutions led by the Bolsheviks before October 1917. There was an earlier attempt in July 1917 but that failed. So the successful one is the October Revolution which is their main revolution.Therefore I think they are the same event. The October Revolution is the specific instance where the Bolsheviks successfully took power so it's also referred to as the Bolshevik Revolution.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,122.27368840004783,0.044765150764384656,0.0131439699862876,0.0,0.0,0.0
110,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the heat from a hair dryer can kill lice. Let me start by recalling what I know about lice and how they survive.Lice are small insects that live on human heads and feed on blood. They have a life cycle that includes eggs (nits) nymphs and adults. To get rid of them people often use treatments like shampoos with chemicals or combs to remove the nits manually.Now about heat. I remember hearing that high heat can kill lice because they are sensitive to temperature changes. But how hot does it need to be? I think it's something around 120 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. So if a hair dryer can reach that temperature it might work.But wait not all hair dryers have the same heat settings. Some might go up to 200°F which is definitely hot enough. However applying that directly to the scalp could be dangerous and cause burns. Maybe there's a safer way like using lower heat for a longer time or ensuring it doesn't stay too close to the skin.I also wonder about the effectiveness. Even if some lice are killed by the heat what about the eggs? I think nits are more resistant because they have a protective coating. So maybe just using a hair dryer isn't enough on its own; you might need to combine it with other methods like combing or chemical treatments.Another thing is that lice can survive for a short time without feeding so if some escape the heat they could come back. Plus applying too much heat repeatedly might damage the hair or scalp which isn't ideal.So putting it all together: while the heat from a hair dryer can kill lice and their eggs when applied at high enough temperatures it's not a foolproof method on its own. It needs to be done carefully to avoid injury and probably used alongside other treatments for better results.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,122.9693672999856,0.045018717678319414,0.013218422453203576,0.0,0.0,0.0
111,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""Lord of All Hopefulness"" is a funeral hymn. First I should probably recall what I know about this hymn. The title sounds familiar; I think it's associated with funerals or maybe other solemn occasions.I remember that hymns often have specific themes and are used in various parts of religious services. Some are more joyful while others are somber. ""Lord of All Hopefulness"" seems to suggest a focus on hope which might be appropriate for a funeral as a way to comfort the bereaved.I should check if this hymn is commonly sung at funerals. Maybe I can think about other hymns that are typically used in funerals and see if they have similar themes or structures. For example ""Abide with Me"" is often played during funerals because of its comforting message. Similarly ""Lord of All Hopefulness"" might be used for the same purpose.Another angle is to consider the lyrics. If I can remember any lines from it that could help. The hymn starts with ""Lord of all hopefulness Thou who didst call our spirits forth "" which seems to address a higher power and talk about life and spirit themes that are relevant in funerals as they deal with death and the afterlife.I also think about where I've heard this hymn before. It's possible that it's played during the recessional at funerals or other solemn services. The melody might be slower and more reflective which fits the mood of a funeral.Additionally looking into its origin could help. If it was written for a specific purpose related to death or mourning that would support it being a funeral hymn. I believe it's an older hymn possibly from the 19th century which might have been composed during a time when such themes were more prevalent in religious music.I should also consider if there are any variations or different versions of this hymn used for other occasions. Sometimes hymns can be adapted for various services but their primary association remains with funerals or similar events.In summary considering the title's focus on hope the context of addressing a higher power and its common usage in solemn services like funerals it seems likely that ""Lord of All Hopefulness"" is indeed a funeral hymn.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,128.13822799999616,0.0469157386789536,0.013775426878966192,0.0,0.0,0.0
112,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether a peck and a bushel are the same thing. Hmm I remember hearing these terms in some contexts maybe related to agriculture or measurements. Let me think about what each of them refers to.A bushel is something I've heard before especially when talking about crops like wheat or corn. I think it's a unit of measurement for volume used to quantify how much of a particular crop you have. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact measurements. Maybe it's related to dry goods?Now a peck. That sounds familiar too but I don't use it often. I think it's also a measure of volume perhaps smaller than a bushel? Or maybe they're used in different contexts. Wait could they be part of the same measurement system? Like how cups and pints relate?Let me try to recall any relationships between them. I believe that in the US customary units there are certain conversions between pecks and bushels. If I remember correctly a bushel is equal to 4 pecks. So if that's the case they aren't the same because one is four times larger than the other.But wait maybe it depends on what you're measuring? Or perhaps in different regions or contexts the terms are used interchangeably? No I think in standard measurements a bushel and a peck have specific definitions. So if a bushel is 4 pecks then they can't be the same.I should also consider whether both are used for dry goods. Yes I believe both are units of volume for dry commodities like grains or fruits. But since their sizes differ they aren't equivalent.So putting it all together: A bushel is a larger unit than a peck specifically four times as much. Therefore they are not the same.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,125.40552820000448,0.045912608694595895,0.013480887260946343,0.0,0.0,0.0
113,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether a cougar and a mountain lion are the same thing. Hmm I've heard both terms before but I'm not entirely sure if they refer to the same animal or different ones.Let me start by recalling what I know about cougars. From what I remember cougars are large wild cats found in North America. They're also sometimes called pumas or panthers. Mountain lions on the other hand sound similar but maybe have a slightly different name. Wait isn't mountain lion another common name for the same animal?I think they might be regional names. Like in some areas people call them cougars and in others mountain lions. I should check if they belong to the same species. The scientific name for cougars is Puma concolor right? And I believe mountain lions are also classified under that same species.So if both terms refer to Puma concolor then they must be the same animal. Maybe the difference comes from where you live. For example in the eastern United States people might call them cougars while in the western parts especially mountainous regions they're called mountain lions. That makes sense because the name could reflect the environment they're commonly found in.I don't recall hearing about any distinct differences between cougars and mountain lions in terms of physical characteristics or behavior. They both are big cats with similar habitats and prey. So it's likely that these are just alternative names for the same species.To be thorough I should consider if there are any subspecies or variations within Puma concolor that might make them different. But from what I know cougars as a whole are a single species without major subspecies distinctions that would warrant separate common names beyond regional preferences.Therefore putting it all together I think the answer is yes they're the same animal referred to by different common names.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,125.44916720001493,0.045936409796724184,0.013487875754599839,0.0,0.0,0.0
114,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether someone can die from a bullet shot into the air. Hmm let's think about this step by step.First when people shoot guns into the air they're usually doing it celebratory or for some other reason without intending to harm anyone. But what happens after the bullet is fired? It goes up and then comes back down due to gravity. So the bullet isn't just disappearing; it's going to come back down at some point.Now when a bullet is fired upwards its initial velocity is high but as it goes up gravity slows it down until it stops momentarily at the peak of its trajectory and then starts falling back down. The question is whether this falling bullet can cause death or serious injury.I remember hearing that bullets shot into the air can be dangerous because they retain enough energy when they come back down to cause harm. But how much energy exactly? Let me think about the physics involved. When a bullet is fired it has kinetic energy which depends on its mass and velocity. As it goes up some of this energy is converted into potential energy but as it falls that potential energy converts back into kinetic energy.However air resistance plays a role here too. The bullet will slow down as it travels through the air both going up and coming down. So by the time it comes back down its speed might be less than when it was fired. But how much less?I think bullets are designed to maintain their velocity over distance but when they're falling from a high altitude even if their speed is reduced they can still cause significant damage upon impact. I've heard stories of people being injured or killed by falling bullets especially in areas where celebratory gunfire is common.Another factor is the angle at which the bullet hits someone. If it's coming straight down it might not have as much lateral force but if it's angled it could hit with more impact. Also the type of bullet matters—some are designed to fragment or expand upon impact increasing their destructive potential.I should also consider real-world incidents. I recall news reports where people were killed by bullets that were shot into the air and fell back down. These cases show that while it's not a common occurrence it is possible for someone to die from such an event.So putting this all together: yes even though the bullet slows down on its way down it can still retain enough energy to cause fatal injuries when it impacts someone.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,121.56472409999697,0.04451921807287321,0.013071759084265007,0.0,0.0,0.0
115,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if the cards Ace 2 3 4 5 form a straight in poker. Hmm let me think about how straights work. A straight is five consecutive numbers right? So like 6 7 8 9 10 or Queen King Ace 2 3—wait no that's not a straight because it wraps around. Or does it?Wait in some games the Ace can be low to make a straight like A-2-3-4-5. But I'm not sure if that's considered a straight in standard poker rules. Let me recall. In Texas Hold'em for example is A-2-3-4-5 a straight? Or is it only when the Ace acts as high?I think in most poker variants the Ace can be used as either high or low to make a straight. So A-2-3-4-5 would count as a straight because they are consecutive numbers. But wait sometimes people say that straights don't wrap around meaning you can't have something like 10-J-Q-K-Ace and then Ace-2-3-4-5. Or is that allowed?Wait no in standard poker rules the Ace can be low to make a straight from A-2-3-4-5. So yes that would be considered a straight. But I'm not 100% sure because sometimes people get confused about whether it's allowed or not.Let me check some sources in my mind. In standard poker rules the lowest possible straight is A-2-3-4-5 and the highest is 10-J-Q-K-Ace. So yes that would make Ace through five a valid straight.

116,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the movie ""Vertical Limit"" is based on a true story. First I'll try to recall what I know about the film. It's an action thriller that came out in 2000 directed by Robert Schenkkan. The main plot involves a rescue team trying to save climbers trapped on Mount Everest after an avalanche.I remember hearing that some movies are inspired by real events but others are completely fictional. I'm not sure about ""Vertical Limit."" Maybe it's based on actual incidents? Let me think about similar movies. For example ""Everest"" (2015) was based on the 1996 Mount Everest disaster which was a true story with real climbers involved.But wait ""Vertical Limit"" came out earlier in 2000. I don't recall any major climbing incidents around that time that it could be based on. Also the plot seems more dramatic and fictionalized like the rescue team having personal issues and conflicts. That makes me think it's not a true story but rather a fictional narrative.I should also consider if there are any real-life events similar to the avalanche in the movie. I know avalanches do happen on Everest but I don't remember a specific incident that matches the scale or circumstances depicted in the film. Plus the characters and their personal struggles seem like they're created for the story rather than based on real people.Another point is the genre. ""Vertical Limit"" is an action thriller which often takes creative liberties to enhance drama. True stories especially in documentaries or biopics tend to stick closer to reality without as much fictional embellishment.I think I've heard before that this movie isn't based on a true story. It's more of a fictional tale meant to entertain rather than recount actual events.

118,<think>Okay so I need to figure out if you can buy alcohol on Sunday in Wisconsin. Hmm I'm not entirely sure about the laws there but I remember hearing that some states have different rules about when and where you can purchase alcohol.First I think about whether Wisconsin has any specific restrictions on Sundays. Maybe they allow sales only at certain times or places? I recall that some states require a permit to sell alcohol on Sundays which might limit availability. Alternatively perhaps there are no restrictions and stores can sell alcohol as usual.I should consider the types of establishments. For example grocery stores versus liquor stores. Maybe one is allowed to sell on Sunday while the other isn't? Or maybe it's about the time of day—like only after a certain hour?Wait I think Wisconsin might have some restrictions. I remember reading somewhere that in some parts of Wisconsin alcohol sales are prohibited on Sundays. But I'm not sure if that's state-wide or just specific counties or cities.Also there could be exceptions for restaurants or bars—they might still serve alcohol even if retail sales are restricted. So maybe you can't buy bottles from a store on Sunday but can have drinks at a bar.I should also think about recent changes in laws. Maybe the rules have been updated recently allowing more flexibility. Or perhaps it's still under strict regulations.To sum up I'm leaning towards the idea that buying alcohol on Sunday is restricted in Wisconsin possibly only allowed in certain places or times.

117,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the Oakland Athletics have ever won a World Series. Hmm I'm not super familiar with all the baseball teams and their histories but I'll try to think it through.First I know that the World Series is the championship of Major League Baseball in the United States. It's been around for over a century so there are quite a few teams that have won it multiple times. The Oakland Athletics are based in Oakland California and they're part of the American League West division.I remember hearing about some famous teams like the New York Yankees or Boston Red Sox winning many World Series titles. But what about the A's? I think they might have had some success in the past. Maybe in the 70s or something?Wait wasn't there a movie called ""Moneyball"" that was about the Oakland Athletics and their approach to building a team using statistics? That was around 2011 but does that relate to them winning the World Series? I don't think so because I remember the A's didn't win in 2011. They were good but they lost in the playoffs.Let me try to recall specific years. The New York Yankees have won a lot like 27 times. The Dodgers and Giants also have several titles. For the A's I think they might have won a couple of times. Maybe in the early 1980s? Or was it earlier?Oh wait I think they were part of the ""Bum deal"" where they traded for some players and had a good run. That was in the late '70s or early '80s. So maybe they won around then.I'm trying to remember specific years. 1989? No that's when the San Francisco Giants won their last World Series before moving into the new ballpark. Wait no the A's were in Oakland at that time. Maybe earlier than that.Wait I think the A's won three consecutive World Series titles in the early '70s. That would be 1972 1973 and 1974. Is that right? So they did win multiple times back then.But wait I'm not entirely sure about the exact years. Let me think again. The team was originally in Philadelphia before moving to Kansas City and then Oakland. They were called the Athletics throughout these moves. So their World Series wins would be under different locations.So if they won three in a row in the early '70s that's when they were based in Oakland. That makes sense because I think they had some star players like Reggie Jackson during that time.But then after that did they win again? I don't recall them winning another World Series since then. They've been to the playoffs several times but haven't won it all again. So their last World Series victory was in 1989? Wait no that's when the Giants won. The A's were in the World Series in 1989 but lost to the Giants.Wait I'm getting confused now. Let me clarify: The Oakland Athletics won three consecutive World Series in 1972 1973 and 1974. Then they went back to the World Series in 1989 but lost to the San Francisco Giants. So their last win was in 1974.Therefore yes the Oakland Athletics have won the World Series multiple times specifically three times in a row from '72 to '74.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,135.4777449000103,0.049634069957877405,0.014573584913349223,0.0,0.0,0.0
119,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the liver is part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Let me start by recalling what the GI tract includes. The GI tract or digestive system typically starts at the mouth and ends at the anus. It's a series of organs that work together to break down food into nutrients that the body can absorb.The main parts I remember are the mouth esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine (colon) rectum and anus. These organs form a continuous pathway where digestion occurs. Now the liver is an organ in the abdomen but I'm not sure if it's part of this tract.I know that the liver plays a crucial role in digestion by producing bile which helps break down fats in the small intestine. However bile isn't produced within the GI tract itself; instead it's stored in the gallbladder and released into the duodenum (part of the small intestine) when needed. So while the liver is essential for digestion it doesn't form part of the actual pathway that food takes through the body.Additionally other organs like the pancreas also contribute to digestion by secreting enzymes but aren't part of the GI tract either. They support the tract's function without being part of it structurally.So putting this together the liver isn't a structural component of the GI tract even though it plays a vital role in digestive processes.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,129.74601629999233,0.047553672524741464,0.013962737391252988,0.0,0.0,0.0
120,<think>Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether it's possible for a person to have twins with different fathers. Hmm let me think about this step by step.First I know that twins usually come from the same mother and father because they develop at the same time in the womb. But wait there are different types of twins—like identical and fraternal. Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting into two so they share the same DNA. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two separate sperm cells.Now if we're talking about someone having twins with different fathers that would mean each twin has a different biological father. How could that happen? I remember hearing something about something called heteropaternal superfecundation. Is that real?So let me break it down. Superfecundation is when two or more eggs are fertilized by sperm from the same man within the same menstrual cycle. But in this case we're talking about different fathers. So if a woman has sex with two different men around the time of ovulation could both men's sperm fertilize separate eggs?I think it's possible because women can release multiple eggs during ovulation especially if they're trying to conceive or have certain conditions that increase egg production. If she has sexual intercourse with two different partners within a short period each partner's sperm might fertilize a different egg.But how common is this? I don't know the exact statistics but it must be rare because it requires specific timing and circumstances. The woman would need to ovulate multiple eggs and both men would have to contribute sperm that successfully fertilizes an egg.I also wonder about the implications of this. Legally and socially how does this affect family structures? It's probably a sensitive topic with potential for confusion or legal issues regarding paternity.So putting it all together yes it is possible through heteropaternal superfecundation where two different men father twins born to the same mother. Therefore the answer should be True.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,128.98718069997267,0.04728284082074546,0.013883215626490145,0.0,0.0,0.0
121,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the answer is True or False for the question: ""Can anyone give last rites in an emergency?"" Hmm let's break this down.First what are last rites? From what I remember last rites are religious ceremonies performed on someone who is dying or has just died. They're usually done by a priest or someone with specific religious authority. But wait the question is about emergencies. So maybe in an emergency situation where a priest isn't available can anyone perform them?I think in some religions there might be provisions for laypeople to administer certain sacraments if a priest isn't around. For example in Catholicism I believe that while priests are typically the ones who administer last rites in extreme emergencies like when someone is on their deathbed and no priest is available maybe a deacon or even a baptized Catholic could step in. But does that mean ""anyone"" can do it? Or only certain people within the faith?Also different religions have different practices. For instance in some Protestant denominations the role might be more flexible. Maybe a minister or even a layperson could perform similar rites if necessary. But again is it anyone regardless of their religious standing?I should consider the context of emergencies. If someone is dying and there's no clergy available perhaps the rules are relaxed. But I'm not sure if that means absolutely anyone can do it or just certain qualified individuals within the religion.Wait in some cases like in the military chaplains might be trained to perform last rites but they're still ordained. So maybe even in emergencies only those with specific religious authority can administer them. That would mean that not just anyone can give last rites even in an emergency.Alternatively I've heard stories where family members or friends have been instructed by clergy on how to perform certain parts of the rite if necessary. But again that's under guidance and not just anyone without any background.So putting it all together: while there might be exceptions in emergencies especially within specific religious contexts it's unlikely that absolutely anyone can give last rites. It probably still requires someone with some level of authorization or training within the religion.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,134.464619699982,0.04929852581255733,0.014475062243373752,0.0,0.0,0.0
123,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether Garfield is a real cat in the movie. Hmm I remember that Garfield is a popular cartoon character from both comics and movies. The question is asking if he's a real cat in the movie version.Wait but Garfield is an animated character right? So in the movies they use animation to bring him to life. That means he's not a real cat; it's all computer-generated or drawn. I don't think any live-action movies have used actual cats for Garfield because that would be difficult given his specific traits and the storylines.Also considering how Garfield interacts with other characters like Odie and Jon those are also animated. So in the context of the movie Garfield is definitely not a real cat but an animated one. Therefore the answer should be False.</think>False,False,False,1,1.0,124.66535420002765,0.045715858337301754,0.013423117304922356,0.0,0.0,0.0
122,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the common femoral vein is a deep vein. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about veins in the body. Veins are classified as either superficial or deep based on their location relative to certain structures usually muscles and fascia.The common femoral vein is located in the thigh area. I remember that it's formed by the union of two other veins: the deep femoral vein and the great saphenous vein. Wait no actually isn't the common femoral vein a continuation of the external iliac vein? Or maybe it's part of the venous system in the lower limb.Wait I think the common femoral vein is a major vein that drains blood from the thigh. It runs alongside the femoral artery and is located deep within the femoral triangle which is a region in the upper part of the thigh. Since it's in the femoral triangle and associated with the femoral artery which is a deep structure I would guess that the common femoral vein is also a deep vein.But wait sometimes veins can have both superficial and deep components. The great saphenous vein is a superficial vein that runs along the inner side of the leg and thigh. It joins with the common femoral vein at the saphenofemoral junction. So if the common femoral vein receives blood from a superficial vein like the great saphenous does that make it a deep vein?I think the classification is based on its primary location. The common femoral vein itself is located deeper in the thigh near the adductor muscles and fascia lata. It's not directly under the skin but rather within the fascial layers. Therefore it should be considered a deep vein.Also considering that deep veins typically accompany arteries and are involved in returning blood from the muscles and deeper tissues while superficial veins drain the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Since the common femoral vein is part of the systemic venous system and drains into the external iliac vein which is definitely a deep structure it makes sense that it's classified as a deep vein.So putting it all together: the common femoral vein is located deep in the thigh accompanies the femoral artery and is part of the deeper venous system. Therefore it should be considered a deep vein.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,129.94215800001984,0.04766095864644953,0.013994238805625484,0.0,0.0,0.0
124,<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the internal resistance of a battery changes. Hmm let's start by recalling what internal resistance is. From what I remember in physics class every real battery has some internal resistance which isn't just the wires but also includes the materials inside the battery that resist the flow of current.Now does this internal resistance stay constant or change? Well when a battery is new it probably has a certain level of internal resistance. But as you use it over time things might change. Maybe the chemicals inside degrade which could affect how easily electrons can move through them. That would mean the internal resistance increases.I also remember that temperature affects resistance. If a battery gets hot its internal resistance might decrease because metals conduct better when they're warmer. But wait batteries aren't just metal; they have electrolytes too. So maybe it's more complicated than that. The electrolyte's resistance could increase with temperature if it becomes less conductive.Another factor is the state of charge. When a battery is fully charged versus discharged does its internal resistance change? I think when it's discharged especially in older batteries the internal resistance goes up because the chemical reactions aren't as efficient anymore.So putting this together: new vs old temperature changes and state of charge all seem to influence internal resistance. Therefore the internal resistance doesn't stay the same; it does change under different conditions.</think>True,True,True,1,1.0,123.02428780001355,0.04511498756802232,0.013246689275033313,0.0,0.0,0.0
125,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""The Young and the Restless"" is going off the air. First I should recall what I know about the show. It's a long-running soap opera that's been on for decades. I think it's still airing regularly but maybe there have been some rumors or announcements about ending.I'll start by checking recent news articles or official statements from the network. Maybe CBS has made any announcements? I remember hearing something about soaps being in trouble because of declining ratings and changing viewership habits. Some shows have ended like ""The Bold and the Beautiful"" was supposed to end but got renewed. Wait no that's another show.I should also consider if there are any specific dates or plans mentioned. If it's going off the air when is the expected last episode? I don't recall hearing a definite date for ""The Young and the Restless."" Maybe they're transitioning to a digital platform instead of traditional TV?Another angle: looking at fan discussions or forums where people talk about the show's future. Sometimes fans get wind of things before official announcements. But without concrete info it's hard to say.I should also think about the show's current status. Are they still producing new episodes? If so that suggests it's not ending anytime soon. Maybe there are plans for a reboot or a spin-off instead of cancellation.Wait I think I read somewhere that some older shows are being moved to streaming services. Could ""The Young and the Restless"" be moving to a platform like Paramount+? That might mean it's not going off the air but changing its distribution method.In summary while there have been challenges in the soap opera genre as of my last update ""The Young and the Restless"" is still airing. There might be discussions about its future but no definite end date has been announced.</think>False",False,False,1,1.0,127.93686829999206,0.04691706521098543,0.013775816376084249,0.0,0.0,0.0
126,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether ""The Greatest Showman"" is based on a true story. Let me start by recalling what I know about the movie. It's about P.T. Barnum and his creation of the Barnum & Bailey Circus. I remember that P.T. Barnum was a real person an impresario who did create a famous circus. So the main character is based on a real individual.But wait does that mean the entire story is true? I think movies often take liberties with historical events for dramatic effect. For example some characters or specific events might be fictionalized to make the story more compelling. I should check if there are any major deviations from actual history in the movie.I recall that the movie portrays Barnum's rise to fame and his relationships including his wife Charity. While Barnum did have a wife named Charity I'm not sure how accurately their relationship is depicted in the film. Also the musical numbers and some of the more fantastical elements might be dramatized for entertainment purposes.Another point is that while the circus was real the exact sequence of events and the people involved might be condensed or altered. For instance the inclusion of certain performers or the specific challenges Barnum faced could be artistic license rather than strict historical facts.So putting it all together: The movie is inspired by a true story because P.T. Barnum was a real person and his circus was a real institution. However the film likely takes creative liberties with details to enhance the narrative. Therefore while it's based on a true story it's not entirely accurate in every aspect.</think>False",False,True,0,0.0,125.81455320000532,0.04615898407238316,0.013553228144774495,0.0,0.0,0.0
127,"<think>Okay so I need to figure out whether the cortex of the cerebellum is made up of gray matter. Let me start by recalling what I know about brain structure.The cerebellum is a part of the brain located at the back below the cerebral hemispheres. It's known for coordinating motor functions and balance. Now the term ""cortex"" usually refers to the outer layer of an organ. In the case of the cerebrum the cortex is indeed gray matter because it's made up of neuron cell bodies.But wait does the same apply to the cerebellum? I think the cerebellar cortex might be different. From what I remember the cerebellum has a unique structure with layers. The outer layer is called the molecular layer and beneath that are the Purkinje cells which are large neurons. Then there's the granular layer deeper down.Gray matter consists of neuron cell bodies while white matter consists of axons and myelin sheaths. So if the cerebellar cortex has a lot of neuron cell bodies especially in the molecular and granular layers then it should be gray matter. But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes structures can have different compositions.I think the cerebellar cortex is indeed gray matter because it contains those layers with neurons. The white matter part would be deeper inside the cerebellum maybe in the core or the peduncles connecting to other parts of the brain. So putting it all together yes the cortex of the cerebellum should be gray matter.</think>True",True,True,1,1.0,124.54990860001999,0.04572580101816658,0.013426036680745716,0.0,0.0,0.0
