6,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the dog from ""The Little Rascals"" is still alive. First I should clarify which specific dog they're referring to because there have been multiple versions of The Little Rascals over the years including different TV shows and movies.  I remember that in the original Our Gang series which later became The Little Rascals there were several dogs. One of the most famous was a dog named Pete played by a real dog named Pal. Pal was a major star in the 1930s and appeared in many films not just The Little Rascals. He was known for his role as Pete.  Now considering that Pal was active in the 1930s I can estimate his lifespan. Dogs typically live around 12-15 years but some can live longer. If Pal was born in say 1928 and passed away in the late 1940s or early 1950s he wouldn't be alive today. In fact I think Pal died in 1952.  There have been other dogs that played Pete in later versions of The Little Rascals especially in TV shows from the 80s and 90s. Those dogs would also not still be alive because even if they were born in the late 70s or early 80s their lifespan wouldn't extend to today.  So putting it all together none of the dogs that played Pete in The Little Rascals are still alive. They've all passed away long ago. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,22.576250399986748,0.007363827221671163,0.00216217129470409,0.0,0.0,0.0
5,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Hope was ever married to Wyatt on the show ""Bold and Beautiful."" First I should recall what I know about these characters. Hope is a main character often involved in various relationships. Wyatt is another prominent character known for his business acumen and sometimes troubled past.  I think they had a significant relationship at some point. Maybe they were engaged or even married? Let me try to remember specific storylines. There was a time when Hope was involved with someone else like Ridge but I'm not sure about Wyatt. Wait wasn't there an episode where Hope and Wyatt got married? Or was that just a fake marriage for some plot reason?  I should also consider the timeline. ""Bold and Beautiful"" has been on air for many years so it's possible their relationship status changed over time. Maybe they were engaged but never actually married on screen. Alternatively perhaps they did tie the knot but I'm mixing up different couples.  Another angle: checking if there are any children involved. If Hope and Wyatt had a child together that might imply a marriage or at least a committed relationship. But I don't recall them having kids together. Maybe it was just a temporary alliance for business reasons.  I should also think about other characters they were paired with. For example Hope has been with Ridge and Wyatt has been with others like Tracy. So maybe their relationship didn't result in marriage but was more of an on-again off-again thing.  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me try to break it down. If the question is whether they were married I need a clear yes or no. From what I remember there was a storyline where Hope and Wyatt got engaged but I don't think they actually went through with the marriage on the show. Or maybe they did but it didn't last long.  Alternatively perhaps in some spin-off or special episode they married but that's less likely. The main series usually keeps relationships dynamic without too many marriages for continuity purposes.  So putting it all together: I think Hope and Wyatt were engaged at one point but never actually married on ""Bold and Beautiful."" Therefore the answer would be False. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,26.53552450001007,0.00879758735892717,0.002583152792361012,0.0,0.0,0.0
2,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Air Force One flies with a fighter escort. Let me start by recalling what I know about Air Force One. It's the plane that carries the President of the United States right? So it's a highly secure and important aircraft.  I remember hearing that when the President travels there are often other planes accompanying him for security reasons. But wait is that always fighter jets or just other support planes? I think sometimes they have multiple planes in the formation maybe some as backups or for different purposes.  I'm trying to recall if I've ever seen images of Air Force One with fighter jets nearby. I think during certain high-profile events or when traveling internationally especially over areas that might be considered risky there could be fighter escorts. But is this a standard practice?  Also considering the size and speed of Air Force One which is a modified Boeing 747 it's not as fast as fighter jets. So if they were to escort would they fly in formation or just provide some sort of protective presence nearby? I'm not entirely sure.  I should also think about security protocols. The President's safety is paramount so having fighter escorts might make sense for added protection against potential threats like missiles or other aircraft. But maybe it's more common during takeoff and landing rather than the entire flight?  Wait another thought: sometimes when a plane is in restricted airspace or entering a country they might require certain escort arrangements. So perhaps Air Force One does have fighter escorts on some occasions but not all the time.  I'm also considering that while I don't have direct knowledge it's plausible that for high-risk missions or international trips especially to areas with known threats fighter escorts would be part of the security measures. But maybe in more routine domestic flights they might not need as much escort.  So putting this together: Air Force One does fly with fighter escorts but it depends on the specific circumstances and level of threat assessment. Therefore the answer is True. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,36.185461399989435,0.012305830885645323,0.0036132453271204,0.0,0.0,0.0
7,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the days get longer and shorter at the equator. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about day length and how it varies around the world.  I remember that the Earth is tilted on its axis which causes seasons and variations in daylight hours. At higher latitudes like near the poles there are extreme changes where days can be very long or very short even leading to midnight sun or polar nights. But what about the equator?  The equator is right at 0 degrees latitude so it's as far from the poles as you can get. I think that because of this the amount of daylight doesn't change much throughout the year. Unlike places in the Northern or Southern Hemispheres where seasons cause days to be longer or shorter the equator should have a more consistent day length.  Wait but does it ever vary at all? Maybe there's some slight variation due to the Earth's orbit or other factors. I think the axial tilt is about 23.5 degrees which affects how sunlight is distributed. But since the equator is directly under the sun during the equinoxes and slightly angled away during solstices does that cause any noticeable change in day length?  I believe that at the equator each day is roughly 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness every day give or take a few minutes. The variation isn't as pronounced as it is elsewhere because the sun's path doesn't dip too far below the horizon during the winter months there.  So putting this together do the days get longer and shorter at the equator? It seems like they don't vary much; instead they stay relatively consistent throughout the year. Therefore the answer should be False. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,48.331546500034165,0.016725938479948868,0.004911079927554953,0.0,0.0,0.0
1,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether anyone has climbed the North Face of Everest. Hmm I remember that Everest is the highest mountain on Earth and it's located in Nepal and Tibet. The usual routes people take are from the South Side like the Southeast Ridge which is more popular because it's a bit less technical compared to other faces.  Wait but the question is about the North Face specifically. I think the North Face is known for being really steep and dangerous. There's something called the Rupal Face on the south side but that's different. The North Face must be on the Tibetan side right? So has anyone actually climbed it?  I recall hearing about some attempts in the 1960s. I think the Chinese made an attempt from the north side during their first ascent of Everest in 1960. But was that via the North Face or another route? Maybe they went through a different part. Then there's the Japanese climbers who tried to climb the North Face in the early '70s. I think they were successful in reaching the summit from the North Face but it was a very difficult and dangerous route.  Wait wasn't there an expedition where some climbers died? Yeah I think the Japanese team had some tragic incidents during their attempt. But despite that did anyone actually make it up the North Face? Or is it still considered unclimbed?  I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to break it down. The first ascent of Everest was by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary in 1953 via the South East Ridge. Then the Chinese made their ascent in 1960 which I think was from the north side but maybe not directly up the North Face. Then in 1975 a Japanese team attempted the North Face route called the ""K2 Route"" or something like that. They had some success but I'm not sure if they actually summited via the North Face.  Wait no I think the first successful ascent of the North Face was by Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler in 1980. But wasn't that on a different face? Or maybe it's another route. No wait Reinhold Messner did climb Everest without oxygen in 1978 via the South East Ridge.  I'm getting mixed up here. Let me think again. The North Face is extremely challenging because of its steepness and the risk of avalanches. I believe that while there have been attempts very few people have actually climbed it successfully. Maybe only a handful of climbers have done it but it's not a common route.  Wait no I think in 1980 Reinhold Messner did climb the North Face as part of his solo ascent without oxygen. But was that the first time? Or was there an earlier attempt?  I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall any specific names or expeditions. There's the Japanese expedition in 1975 where they tried the North Face but I think they had some tragic accidents with avalanches killing several members. Despite that did anyone from that team reach the summit? Or was it only later attempts?  Alternatively maybe the first successful climb of the North Face was by a different group. I'm not entirely sure but I think at least one person has climbed the North Face of Everest. It's a very difficult and dangerous route so it's not as frequently attempted as other routes.  Wait another thought: the North Face is often referred to as the ""unclimbed"" face because it's so challenging. But that might be a misconception. I think there have been successful ascents but they are rare and require extremely skilled climbers.  So putting it all together despite the difficulties yes there have been climbers who have successfully climbed the North Face of Everest. It's not as common as other routes but it has been done. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,53.61786169998231,0.01865631930509979,0.005477879484679991,0.0,0.0,0.0
10,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Central Bank of India is a nationalized bank. Let me start by recalling what I know about banks in India. There are public sector banks which are majority-owned by the government and private banks which are owned by private entities. Nationalized banks fall under the public sector category because they were taken over by the government through nationalization.  The Central Bank of India was established in 1913 right? I think it's one of the older banks in the country. Now when did the nationalization happen? From what I remember there were two major waves of bank nationalization in India: the first in 1969 and the second in 1980. The 1969 nationalization affected 14 banks and then another 6 in 1980.  I'm trying to recall which banks were nationalized in those years. I know that some of the big names like State Bank of India Punjab National Bank Canara Bank etc. were nationalized. But was Central Bank of India among them? Wait I think it wasn't part of either wave. Instead Central Bank of India is actually a private bank that has been around since before nationalization.  So if the Central Bank of India wasn't nationalized in 1969 or 1980 then it's not a nationalized bank. It remains under private ownership even though many other banks were taken over by the government during those periods. Therefore the answer should be False because it's not a nationalized bank; it's a private sector bank. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,59.76230809997651,0.02090637373908528,0.006138541795491381,0.0,0.0,0.0
14,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Leslie Knope wins the city council election. Let me think about this step by step.  First I remember that Leslie is a character from ""Parks and Recreation."" She's the Deputy Director of the Parks Department in Pawnee. Throughout the series she has various experiences both personal and professional.  I recall that at some point Leslie decides to run for city council. This happens in one of the later seasons maybe season 6 or 7? I think it was a significant storyline because it involved her stepping into a more political role beyond her usual job.  Now does she win? I'm trying to remember specific episodes. There's an episode where she campaigns and there are some funny moments with her signs and campaign strategies. But I also remember that the election results were close. She had a tough opponent maybe someone like Jerry Gergich or another character who was against her.  Wait in one of the episodes after the election night they show the results coming in. I think she actually loses by a small margin. That's pretty sad because she put so much effort into it. But then there's a twist where some votes were miscounted or something like that and she ends up winning after all.  So putting it together: She runs for city council the initial results show her losing but due to a recount or some error she actually wins. Therefore yes she does win the election in the end. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,63.8832362999965,0.022398348383221085,0.0065766162710145445,0.0,0.0,0.0
0,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the World Cup has ever been decided by a penalty shootout. Hmm I remember that in football tournaments sometimes when teams are tied after extra time they go into a penalty shootout to determine the winner. But does this happen in the World Cup?  I think the World Cup is the biggest tournament so maybe it's more likely for such a scenario to occur there. Let me try to recall specific instances. I know that in 1994 the United States hosted the World Cup and I believe that was the first time a World Cup final went to penalties. The teams were Brazil and Italy right? They played extra time but couldn't score so they had to take penalties. Brazil won that shootout.  Wait is there another instance? Maybe in 2018 or something? No I think in 2018 the final was between France and Croatia and France won in regular time with a goal by Mbappé. So no penalty shootout there. What about other finals?  I also remember that in some earlier tournaments like maybe 1968 European Cup but that's not the World Cup. The World Cup started having penalty shootouts after the 1970s I think. So yes at least once the World Cup final was decided by penalties.  So putting it all together the answer should be True because in 1994 Brazil won the World Cup on penalties against Italy. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,74.05919219998759,0.02612046874291056,0.007669507447693707,0.0,0.0,0.0
11,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's a Season 2 of ""Case Histories."" Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. ""Case Histories"" is a British crime drama that aired on BBC One. It stars Mark Strong as Dr. Eddie Dunlop who solves crimes using his knowledge of psychology and criminal behavior.  I remember watching the first season which had six episodes. The show was pretty well-received so I thought maybe there would be more seasons. But I'm not entirely sure if a second season was actually produced or aired. Sometimes shows get canceled after one season especially if they don't meet ratings expectations.  Let me think about any news or announcements regarding a Season 2. I don't recall hearing much about it continuing beyond the first season. Maybe there were talks or plans but nothing concrete came out of it. It's possible that the show was intended to be a limited series meaning only one season was ever made.  I should also consider the source material. ""Case Histories"" is based on the book by Val McDermid. The book might have enough content for multiple seasons but that doesn't necessarily mean the TV adaptation will follow suit. Studios often decide based on audience response and ratings whether to proceed with more seasons.  Another angle is looking at Mark Strong's involvement. If he was committed to returning it might indicate plans for a second season. However I don't remember any interviews or statements from him about a renewal. It seems like the show didn't gain enough traction to warrant another season.  I can also check online sources or databases that track TV shows. For example IMDb lists ""Case Histories"" with only one season as of now. That suggests there isn't an official Season 2 available. If there were plans for a second season it might be listed under upcoming episodes or in development.  Additionally considering the show's runtime and the number of episodes sometimes shows have shorter seasons that can lead to more installments. But without any confirmed information it's safer to assume that only one season exists.  In summary based on my knowledge and a bit of reasoning I don't think there's a Season 2 of ""Case Histories."" The show likely concluded after its first run. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,75.07846679998329,0.026481401837868904,0.007775484836045648,0.0,0.0,0.0
13,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" was written specifically for Top Gun. Let me start by recalling what I know about the song and the movie.  First ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" is a song by Kenny Loggins. It's pretty iconic because it was used in the 1986 movie Top Gun. The movie itself is all about fighter pilots and their high-stakes lives so the song fits that theme well with its energetic and intense vibe.  Now I'm trying to remember if the song was written just for the movie or if it existed before. I think Kenny Loggins had a successful career before Top Gun so maybe he wrote this song specifically for the film's soundtrack. But wait sometimes songs are already popular when they're used in movies and other times they're created after the movie is made.  I should check the release dates. The movie Top Gun came out in 1986. Kenny Loggins released ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" around that time as well. I believe it was part of the original soundtrack for the movie. So yes it was written specifically for Top Gun because it's featured prominently in the film and wasn't a pre-existing song.  Wait but sometimes songs are used in movies after they're already released. Did ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" come out before or after the movie? I think it came out around the same time as the movie's release which suggests that it was created for the soundtrack. Also the title of the song includes ""Danger Zone "" which is a term used in the movie so that ties it directly to Top Gun.  Another point: the song became widely popular because of its use in the movie. If it had been written before maybe it wouldn't have had such a big boost from the film. So putting it all together I think ""Highway to the Danger Zone"" was indeed written for Top Gun. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,87.63452100002905,0.031069211125707836,0.00912256010670782,0.0,0.0,0.0
4,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's a Line of Duty Series 4. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. Line of Duty is a British police procedural drama that started airing on BBC in 2012. It's known for its intense storylines and has been pretty popular.  I remember watching the first few seasons but I'm not sure how many total seasons there are. Let me think... Season 1 was 2012-2013 then Season 2 in 2014 Season 3 in 2015 and Season 4 in 2016. Wait that seems a bit off because sometimes shows have gaps between seasons. Maybe I should check the exact release years.  Wait no actually Line of Duty has been on hiatus for a while after Season 3. There was some controversy involving one of the main actors which led to the show being put on hold. But then in recent years there were rumors about it returning. I think they did make a new season but maybe it's not called Series 4.  Hold on I think the latest information is that Line of Duty returned with a special episode or perhaps a new series under a different name. Or maybe they decided to reboot it instead of continuing as Series 4. I'm getting confused now because there was some legal stuff involved after Season 3 so the original cast couldn't return.  So putting this together: The show had Seasons 1-3 then went on hiatus. There were plans for a Series 4 but due to issues with the actors it didn't happen. Instead they made a new series called Line of Duty: New Beginnings or something like that which is considered a reboot rather than a continuation.  Therefore there isn't an official Series 4; instead they started fresh with new characters and storylines. So the answer would be False because Series 4 doesn't exist as a direct continuation. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,88.70776599997771,0.03146076434260398,0.00923752819333408,0.0,0.0,0.0
3,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's ever been a Duke of Sussex before. Hmm I remember that titles like Duke are part of the British peerage system. The Sussex area is in England right? So maybe someone was given that title before.  I think about famous people with similar titles. There's Prince Harry who is the Duke of Sussex now. But has anyone else held that title before him? I'm not sure. Maybe looking into historical figures would help.   Wait I recall that titles can be inherited or created anew by the monarch. So perhaps the Duke of Sussex was a title given to someone in the past and then maybe it became extinct if there were no heirs. Or maybe it's been reused.  I should think about British history. The Dukedom is one of the highest ranks so not everyone gets that. Maybe looking at the 19th century? I think the current Duke Prince Harry was given the title in 2018 when he married Meghan Markle. But before him who had it?  I believe there was a previous Duke of Sussex in the 19th century. Let me see... The first Duke might have been someone from the royal family as well. Maybe a brother or uncle of a monarch? I think King George III had several sons who were granted dukedoms.  Yes I remember now! The first Duke of Sussex was Prince Augustus Frederick who was the ninth son of King George III. He was created Duke of Sussex in 1801. After his death since he didn't have any legitimate children the title became extinct. So when Prince Harry was made Duke of Sussex it was a revival of that old title.  So putting it all together: Yes there has been a Duke of Sussex before Prince Harry. The first one was Prince Augustus Frederick in 1801. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,101.30921800000942,0.036084187565074324,0.010595060448500842,0.0,0.0,0.0
16,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Salt Lake City is the biggest city in Utah. Let me start by recalling what I know about Utah's geography and cities.  First off Utah is a state in the western United States. It's known for its natural beauty like the Great Salt Lake and various mountain ranges. The capital of Utah is Salt Lake City which I think is also one of the larger cities there. But is it the biggest?  I remember that when people talk about big cities in Utah they often mention Salt Lake City but sometimes other cities come up too. For example Provo or Ogden might be mentioned as significant places. However I'm not sure if any of those are bigger than Salt Lake City.  To determine which city is the biggest I should consider factors like population and area. Population is a common measure for city size. I think Salt Lake City has a decent population but maybe other cities have grown more in recent years.  I can try to recall some numbers. Salt Lake City's population is around 200 000 people if I'm not mistaken. But wait that might just be the city proper. The metropolitan area would include surrounding suburbs and could be much larger. However when comparing cities within a state it's usually about the city limits unless specified otherwise.  Now are there any other Utah cities with populations over 200 000? I'm trying to think of others. Provo has a significant population because of Brigham Young University but I don't think it surpasses Salt Lake City in size. Ogden is another notable city but again probably not bigger than Salt Lake.  Wait maybe there's a larger city that I'm forgetting. Let me think about the order of cities by population in Utah. According to what I remember after Salt Lake City comes West Valley City which might have a similar or slightly smaller population. Then Provo and Ogden follow. So if Salt Lake City is first then it's the biggest.  But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there are other factors like land area that could make another city larger in terms of geography but not necessarily in population. However when people refer to the ""biggest"" city they usually mean by population unless specified otherwise.  I should also consider any recent growth trends. Utah is a state with significant population growth especially in urban areas. Salt Lake City has been growing but so have other cities like West Valley and Provo. But even if those are growing quickly I don't think they've overtaken Salt Lake City yet.  Another angle: looking at the metropolitan statistical area (MSA). The Salt Lake City MSA includes several cities and has a much larger population than just the city itself. However the question is about the city within Utah not the metro area. So focusing on individual cities Salt Lake City still seems to be the largest.  I think I've considered enough points. Based on my understanding Salt Lake City is indeed the biggest city in Utah by population. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,108.0848123000178,0.03853776523415815,0.011315481371714203,0.0,0.0,0.0
15,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the statement ""Was she like the wind in Dirty Dancing"" is true or false. Let me break this down step by step.  First I remember that ""Dirty Dancing"" is a popular movie from 1987. The main characters are Baby Houseman and Johnny Castle. They have a dance scene where they perform something called ""the time of my life."" Now the question is about whether she (presumably Baby) was like the wind in this context.  I think the phrase ""like the wind"" might be referring to how someone moves quickly or gracefully maybe even unpredictably. In the movie there's a scene where Baby and Johnny are dancing and it's quite passionate and energetic. They move together smoothly almost as if they're one with the music.  Wait but does the movie specifically describe her movement as being like the wind? I don't recall any line in the dialogue that explicitly says she was ""like the wind."" The iconic line is more about their dance being unforgettable or something along those lines.   Also considering the context of the question it might be mixing up different metaphors. For example sometimes people use ""wind"" to describe someone who's elusive or hard to catch but in this case Baby and Johnny are very much connected during their dance.  So putting it all together while the dance is memorable and dynamic I don't think the movie refers to her as being like the wind. Therefore the statement is likely false. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,111.44983369999682,0.03980367336618562,0.011687178064535455,0.0,0.0,0.0
9,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Meredith has a baby in Grey's Anatomy. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. Meredith is one of the main characters and she's a surgeon at Seattle Grace Hospital. She's been through a lot of personal and professional challenges over the years.  I remember that Meredith had some storylines involving her fertility. There was an episode where she went through in vitro fertilization (IVF) with her husband Derek Shepherd. They were trying to conceive but faced some difficulties. I think they successfully had a child together. The baby's name was Lila if I'm not mistaken.  Wait but then there was a twist later on. I believe that after having Lila Meredith found out that the baby wasn't actually hers biologically. There was a mix-up at the hospital where someone else's embryo was implanted into her instead of Derek and Meredith's. That led to some major plot points including legal issues and emotional turmoil for both Meredith and Derek.  So in terms of having a biological child Meredith didn't have Lila as her own. However she did give birth to the baby so technically she had a baby in the show. But later on it was revealed that the child wasn't genetically hers or Derek's. They ended up adopting another child named Henry who is their biological son.  So putting this together: Meredith does have a baby in Grey's Anatomy—she gives birth to Lila but that baby isn't biologically hers. Later she and Derek adopt Henry who is their biological son through surrogacy with Callie and Arizona. Therefore the answer would be true because she did give birth to a child even though it wasn't her biological child. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,119.5454087999824,0.04276203030190713,0.012555812573922296,0.0,0.0,0.0

The United Kingdom often abbreviated as the UK consists of four countries: England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland. These are all located in the British Isles which are off the northwestern coast of mainland Europe. The UK has its own government currency (the pound sterling) and is a member of various international organizations like NATO and the European Union.  On the other hand the Netherlands is a country in Northwestern Europe. It's part of the Benelux region along with Belgium and Luxembourg. The Netherlands is known for its tulips windmills and being low-lying hence the name which means ""low countries."" They have their own government currency (the euro) and are also part of the European Union.  I remember that the UK and the Netherlands are both in Europe but are separate sovereign states. The Netherlands is not part of the British Isles or the UK. They share some historical ties especially through trade and colonial history but they are distinct nations with their own political systems and territories.  So putting it all together the Netherlands is a country on mainland Europe while the United Kingdom is an island nation off the coast of Europe. Therefore the Netherlands is not part of the UK. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,120.53832970000803,0.043130936422404516,0.012664131006738416,0.0,0.0,0.0
8,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the UEFA Champions League final is just one game or if it's more than that. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Champions League. It's a prestigious football tournament involving top clubs from Europe. The competition starts with a group stage where teams are divided into groups and play each other then progresses through knockout rounds.  Now focusing on the final: I remember that in some tournaments finals can be two-legged matches meaning each team hosts one game at their home stadium. But for the Champions League I think it's different. From what I've seen or heard the final is a single match held at a neutral venue. This makes sense because it ensures fairness since both teams don't have to play away from their home ground which can be a significant advantage.  Wait but sometimes if the game ends in a draw after extra time there's a penalty shootout to decide the winner. So even though it's one game it might go into overtime or penalties. But that doesn't make it two separate games; it's still considered one match with possible extensions.  I should also consider any changes over the years. I don't think they've ever had a two-game final in recent history. It's always been a single-venue showdown. So putting it all together yes the Champions League final is just one game. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,128.77751100002206,0.04613365695701884,0.013545791582214032,0.0,0.0,0.0
19,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Glenn died in The Walking Dead Season 6. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. Glenn is a main character who's been around since the early seasons. He was part of the group that started at the farm and then moved to Woodbury.   I remember that in Season 4 there was a big battle with the Governor and some characters died. But I think Glenn survived that. Then in Season 5 they were at the prison and there was a lot going on with the Savior's attack. I don't recall Glenn dying then either.  Season 6 starts after the events of the prison being overrun by the Saviors. The group is split up and some are at Hilltop while others are at the Kingdom. I think in Season 6 there's an episode where Glenn goes with a group to the Kingdom to try to make peace or something.   Wait wasn't there a big battle between the Hilltop and the Saviors? I believe that was in Season 7 not 6. So maybe in Season 6 things are still building up. But then again I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact timeline.  I think Glenn does die but I'm trying to remember when. Was it in Season 6 or later? I recall that his death was pretty impactful and happened during a major battle. If Season 7 had the big battle with Negan and the Saviors then maybe that's when he died.   But wait some sources say that Glenn dies in Season 6. Let me think about specific episodes. There's an episode called ""Here's Not Here"" which I think is from Season 6. In that episode there's a scene where Glenn is killed by Negan with a barbed wire baseball bat. That sounds familiar.  So putting it all together: Season 6 includes the events leading up to and including Glenn's death at the hands of Negan. Therefore yes he dies in Season 6. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,134.25709619995905,0.04813300184520314,0.014132840408227144,0.0,0.0,0.0
18,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Johnson & Wales University is a for-profit school. Let me start by recalling what I know about the institution. Johnson & Wales is known for its programs in hospitality culinary arts business and other related fields. They have multiple campuses across the United States.  I think most universities are either non-profit or for-profit. Non-profit schools typically include public universities funded by states and private universities that rely on donations and tuition. For-profit institutions often market themselves more aggressively and may be listed in stock exchanges since they aim to generate profits for shareholders.  Johnson & Wales from what I remember is a private university. Private universities can be either non-profit or for-profit. To determine which category Johnson & Wales falls into I should check their structure. If it's owned by a board of trustees and reinvests its earnings back into the institution rather than distributing profits to owners it's likely non-profit.  I also recall that some well-known universities like Harvard or Stanford are non-profit. For-profit schools might include institutions like the University of Phoenix or DeVry. I don't think Johnson & Wales is listed among the major for-profit chains but I'm not entirely sure.  Another way to check is by looking up their financial statements or official website. If they're a public company that would indicate they are for-profit. However if they're private and emphasize educational mission over profits they might be non-profit.  I think Johnson & Wales was founded with the purpose of providing education in specific fields and has expanded through donations and tuition rather than seeking profit. Therefore I believe it's a non-profit institution. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,139.7154315999942,0.05013593947319368,0.014720944136622475,0.0,0.0,0.0
12,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Pokémon Let's Go Eevee is a spin-off or not. First I should understand what a spin-off typically means. A spin-off usually refers to a work that branches off from the main series but isn't directly part of it. It might have different characters settings or focus on specific elements.  Pokémon Let's Go Eevee was released in 2018 for the Nintendo Switch. I remember it being a reimagining of Pokémon Yellow: Special Edition which was originally on the Game Boy. The game features Eevee as the starter Pokémon and follows a similar storyline to the original games but with some modern twists.  Now is this considered a spin-off? Well it's part of the main series because it continues the adventure of Ash Ketchum and Pikachu even though it's set in the Kanto region. It also introduces new mechanics like co-op play and simplified catching mechanics which are different from the core games but still within the Pokémon universe.  So while it has some unique elements it doesn't diverge enough to be considered a spin-off. Instead it's more of a remade or enhanced version of an existing title. Therefore I think it's not a spin-off. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,142.81364469998516,0.05127231681933265,0.015054607923646537,0.0,0.0,0.0
20,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Melaleuca and Tea Tree are the same thing. Let me start by breaking down what each term refers to.  First Melaleuca. I know that's a genus of plants right? It's part of the myrtle family Myrtaceae. There are many species in this genus like Melaleuca alternifolia and others. They're native to Australia if I'm not mistaken. These plants are known for their essential oils which have various uses.  Now Tea Tree. That term is often associated with the essential oil that's popular for its medicinal properties. From what I remember the common name ""Tea Tree"" usually refers specifically to Melaleuca alternifolia. So in this context Tea Tree is a type of Melaleuca plant.  But wait are all Melaleucas called Tea Trees? Probably not. The term Tea Tree seems to be more specific to M. alternifolia because that's the species most commonly used for its essential oil. Other Melaleuca species might have different common names or uses.  So putting it together: Melaleuca is a genus with multiple species and Tea Tree refers specifically to one of those species M. alternifolia. Therefore they're not exactly the same thing because Melaleuca is broader encompassing many plants while Tea Tree is just one specific type within that genus.  I should also consider if there are any other common names or overlaps. For example sometimes people might use ""Tea Tree"" more generally to refer to any Melaleuca species used for oil but the strict answer would be that they're not the same because Melaleuca is a genus and Tea Tree is a specific species within it.  Another angle: checking if there's any overlap in usage beyond M. alternifolia. I think some other Melaleucas might have similar properties or uses but they aren't commonly referred to as Tea Trees. So the primary association of Tea Tree is with M. alternifolia.  In summary while closely related and often used interchangeably in common parlance technically Melaleuca refers to a genus and Tea Tree refers specifically to one species within that genus. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,128.87537650001468,0.04698656802248154,0.013796223832613901,0.0,0.0,0.0
21,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether there will be new episodes of Black Mirror. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. Black Mirror is a British science fiction anthology series that explores themes related to modern society and technology. It's known for its thought-provoking storylines and often dystopian take on future tech.  I remember that the show has had several seasons so far. The first season was in 2011 and it went through multiple seasons with varying numbers of episodes. I think the latest season before this was Season 5 which came out in 2020. Since then there hasn't been an official announcement about a new season.  I should check if there have been any recent news or updates from Netflix or the creators. Sometimes shows get renewed even without big announcements. But as of my last update in October 2023 I don't recall hearing anything specific about Black Mirror being renewed for another season.   Also considering the nature of the show each season is standalone with different stories and characters so it's possible that they take time between seasons to develop new episodes. However without any official word it's hard to say for sure.  Another angle is looking at the popularity of the show. Black Mirror has a strong fan base and was quite successful which usually increases the chances of renewal. But sometimes shows get canceled despite their success if the creative team decides to move on or other factors come into play.  I should also consider any interviews or statements from the creators. If Charlie Brooker the creator has mentioned anything about future episodes that would be a good indicator. From what I know he's been involved in other projects like The Front Runner and maybe other shows but nothing definitive about Black Mirror.  In summary while there hasn't been an official confirmation of new episodes it's possible that Netflix might renew the show given its popularity. However without any concrete information as of now I can't say for certain that new episodes are coming. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,126.47062120001647,0.04612707054806157,0.013543857676928926,0.0,0.0,0.0
23,<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether it's possible for twins to have two different fathers. Hmm let me think about this step by step.  First I know that twins are usually born from the same mother but the question is about having two different fathers. So how does twin conception work? Normally twins can be either identical or fraternal. Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting into two so they share the same genetic material and thus have the same father. Fraternal twins develop from two separate eggs being fertilized by two separate sperm cells.  Wait but if it's fraternal twins each twin comes from a different egg. So theoretically if the mother had intercourse with two different men around the time of conception could each egg be fertilized by a different father? I think this is possible in cases where the woman ovulates more than one egg and has sexual encounters with different partners within a short timeframe.  I remember hearing about something called heteropaternal superfecundation. That's when two eggs are fertilized by sperm from two different fathers. So yes it's possible for twins to have different fathers if each twin is conceived through separate acts of conception involving different men.  But wait how common is this? I think it's rare because the timing has to be just right—ovulating multiple eggs and having intercourse with different partners close enough in time for fertilization. Also medical testing would usually reveal that the twins have different fathers if DNA tests are done.  So putting it all together: yes it's possible for twins to have two different fathers through heteropaternal superfecundation. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,115.70916220001527,0.04220483673289764,0.012392209069353292,0.0,0.0,0.0
22,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether using a hot tub can cause a rash. Let me think about this step by step.  First what do I know about hot tubs? They're basically large baths filled with warm water often used for relaxation. People sometimes add jets or bubbles to make it more enjoyable. But I've heard that they can also be germ-filled if not maintained properly.  So rashes... Rashes are skin reactions right? They can come from various things like allergies infections or irritation. In the context of a hot tub what could cause a rash?  One possibility is bacteria. Hot tubs can harbor bacteria like pseudomonas which can cause something called ""hot tub folliculitis."" I remember hearing about that before. It's when you get red bumps on your skin after using a hot tub. That makes sense because the warm water and maybe the chemicals could create an environment where bacteria thrive.  Another thing is the chemicals used in hot tubs like chlorine or bromine. These are added to keep the water clean but sometimes people can be sensitive or allergic to these chemicals. If someone has sensitive skin exposure to high levels of chlorine might cause a rash or irritation.  Then there's the issue of pH balance. If the water isn't properly balanced it could be too acidic or alkaline. Either extreme can irritate the skin and lead to rashes. I think that's why pool operators often check the pH levels regularly.  Also hot tubs can dry out the skin because of the heat and chemicals. Dry skin might become flaky or itchy which some people could mistake for a rash. So maybe that's another way using a hot tub could lead to skin issues.  I should also consider other factors like personal hygiene. If someone doesn't rinse off properly after using a hot tub residual chemicals or bacteria could stay on the skin and cause irritation over time.  Wait are there any other possibilities? Maybe fungal infections? Hot tubs can sometimes have fungi if not cleaned well especially in warm moist environments. Fungal infections can cause rashes too like ringworm or something similar.  So putting it all together: bacteria (like pseudomonas) chemical sensitivity improper pH levels skin drying from heat and chemicals and possible fungal infections are all potential causes of a rash from using a hot tub. It seems pretty plausible that any one of these factors could lead to a rash after using a hot tub.  I don't think I'm missing anything major here. The key points are the microbial environment chemical exposure pH issues skin dryness and personal sensitivity or hygiene practices. All of these contribute to the possibility of developing a rash. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,133.42821889999323,0.048666787178524955,0.0142895707728188,0.0,0.0,0.0
24,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Thousand Island dressing is the same as French dressing. Hmm let me think about this step by step.  First I remember that both are types of salad dressings but they have different names. I've heard of Thousand Island before; it's usually a red or pinkish dressing with bits in it like pickles and maybe some cheese. It's pretty thick and creamy often used on salads like the classic wedge salad.  French dressing on the other hand sounds more familiar as something else. Wait isn't French dressing actually vinaigrette? I think that's right. Vinaigrette is a mix of oil vinegar maybe some herbs or mustard and it's usually tangy and not creamy. It's definitely different from Thousand Island in texture and taste.  So if Thousand Island is creamy with added ingredients and French dressing is more like a vinaigrette they must be different. I don't think they're the same at all. They have distinct flavors and consistencies so it makes sense that they are separate dressings. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,118.02803899999708,0.043051820699539514,0.01264090100149942,0.0,0.0,0.0
26,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Fred from First Dates has a partner. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. First Dates is a reality TV series where people go on blind dates and decide if they want to continue seeing each other after just one date. Each episode features different participants and sometimes there are recurring characters or regulars who appear in multiple episodes.  Fred is one of those regulars right? He's known for his laid-back personality and has been on the show quite a bit. I remember him going on several dates with different women. Now does he have a partner? Well from what I've seen Fred tends to date casually. He doesn't seem to be in a long-term relationship while on the show. Each time he goes on a date it's presented as a new opportunity and there's no mention of him having someone back home or being committed.  Also if he had a partner I think the show would probably mention that at some point especially since they often talk about each person's dating history and current status. But in all the episodes featuring Fred it's always portrayed as him looking for something new. So based on this I don't think Fred has a partner while he's on First Dates. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,116.34988100000191,0.042459056896900486,0.012466853343939785,0.0,0.0,0.0
25,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether liquid nitrogen and dry ice are the same thing. Let me start by recalling what each of these substances is.  Liquid nitrogen is a substance that's commonly used for freezing things quickly because it has very low temperatures. It's made from nitrogen gas which is N2 right? When you cool nitrogen gas down to its boiling point which is around -196 degrees Celsius it becomes liquid. I remember seeing it in labs or sometimes in restaurants for flash-freezing food.  Dry ice on the other hand is something I've heard about too. It's used for creating fog effects because when it sublimates (turns from solid to gas) it absorbs heat and can cause water vapor in the air to condense. Dry ice is actually carbon dioxide in its solid form. So at standard atmospheric pressure carbon dioxide doesn't have a liquid state; it goes directly from gas to solid and vice versa.  So comparing the two: liquid nitrogen is N2 in liquid form while dry ice is CO2 in solid form. They're both used for cooling or creating effects but they are different chemicals. Liquid nitrogen boils at -196°C whereas dry ice sublimates at around -78°C. That's a significant difference in temperature.  Another point to consider is their composition. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide are entirely different elements; nitrogen is diatomic (N2) while carbon dioxide is a molecule with one carbon and two oxygen atoms. Their physical states under standard conditions also differ: nitrogen is a gas and carbon dioxide can be a gas or solid depending on the temperature.  I don't think they're used interchangeably either. Liquid nitrogen is often used in cryogenics for preserving biological samples or in industrial processes where rapid freezing is needed. Dry ice is more commonly used for refrigeration without melting (since it sublimates) and for fog effects in events or haunted houses.  So putting this all together: they are both substances used for cooling but made of different elements have different physical states at standard conditions and serve different purposes. Therefore liquid nitrogen and dry ice are not the same thing. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,124.40290810001898,0.04540298284754086,0.013331250618970433,0.0,0.0,0.0
27,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether breakfast lunch and dinner are always served in Italy. Hmm let's break this down step by step.  First I know that meal times can vary a lot depending on the country and culture. In some places people might have different eating habits compared to others. So I should think about what typical Italian meals look like.  In Italy I remember hearing that they usually have breakfast (colazione) lunch (pranzo) and dinner (cena). But does every place in Italy follow this exactly? Maybe not always. For example some people might skip breakfast if they're busy or prefer to eat later. Also in smaller towns or rural areas meal times could be a bit different compared to big cities.  Another thing is that restaurants might have specific hours when they serve each meal. So even though the meals exist not every restaurant might offer all three at any time. Some places might only serve breakfast in the morning and then close until lunchtime. Similarly dinner might start later in the evening.  Also considering different regions within Italy there could be variations. Northern Italy might have slightly different meal times compared to Southern Italy. So it's possible that not every Italian household or restaurant serves all three meals every day without exception.  Therefore while breakfast lunch and dinner are common in Italy they aren't always served everywhere at the same time or by everyone. There can be exceptions based on personal preferences regional differences and business hours of restaurants. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,116.50129410001682,0.042528591495997865,0.01248727013396368,0.0,0.0,0.0
28,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Scar is alive in The Lion King 2. Let me start by recalling what happens in the first movie. In The Lion King Scar betrays Mufasa and takes over as king. He's eventually defeated by Simba who returns to Pride Rock. During their final battle Scar falls off a cliff into the elephant graveyard which I think is where he dies because that's a common trope in these kinds of stories.  Now The Lion King 2 is set years later. Simba is now king and his son Kovu is the main character. I don't remember Scar being around in this movie. The main antagonists are more like Zira and her group who are part of the Outsiders. They're trying to take over Pride Land but they're not connected to Scar as far as I can tell.  Wait maybe there's a mention or a reference? Let me think. In the second movie Kovu is supposed to be Scar's nephew right? So Scar would have been his uncle. But since Scar died in the first movie he can't be alive in the second one. The story doesn't bring him back as a ghost or anything like that.  Also considering the timeline The Lion King 2 happens after Simba has taken over and things are more settled. There's no indication that Scar survived his fall. In fact it would make sense for him to be dead because he was the main antagonist and his death wraps up that part of the story.  So putting it all together I don't think Scar is alive in The Lion King 2. He died at the end of the first movie and there's no mention or appearance of him in the sequel. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,121.04063049997785,0.044192392141206384,0.012975796261327598,0.0,0.0,0.0
29,"<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether alligators drown their prey and then eat it later. Hmm I remember hearing that alligators are big predators but I'm not exactly sure about their hunting methods. Let me think through this step by step.  First I know that alligators are semi-aquatic animals meaning they live both in water and on land. They're known for being ambush predators which means they hide and wait for prey to come close before attacking. So maybe they use the water as part of their hunting strategy.  I've heard stories about alligators grabbing prey with their strong jaws and pulling them into the water. But does that mean they drown their prey? I think some animals might not survive being submerged especially if they can't breathe underwater. But wait do alligators actually hold their prey under water until it drowns?  I also recall that alligators have a powerful bite force. They can clamp down on prey and shake them violently to subdue them. Maybe the act of shaking or pulling into the water is more about overpowering the prey rather than drowning it.   Another thought: some predators like crocodiles are known to use a technique called the ""death roll "" where they spin rapidly to tear flesh from their prey. Alligators might do something similar. If that's the case maybe they don't necessarily drown their prey but instead use the water as a tool to control and subdue it.  I should also consider how alligators eat their food. They can swallow large chunks or even whole animals especially if the prey is small enough. So after subduing the prey whether by drowning or not they would start eating immediately rather than storing it for later.  Wait but what about larger prey? If an alligator takes down something big like a deer maybe it drags it into the water to make it easier to handle. But does that mean the prey is drowned? Or is it just being moved to a safer place where the alligator can feed without competition?  I think I've read somewhere that alligators don't typically drown their prey as a method of killing. Instead they use their bite and strength to overpower them quickly. The water might help in controlling the prey's movements but isn't necessarily used to cause drowning.  So putting it all together: Alligators are ambush predators who use the element of surprise and their strong jaws to capture prey. They might pull prey into the water to subdue it but the primary method is overpowering rather than drowning. Once they've subdued the prey they start eating immediately rather than storing it for later.  Therefore the statement that alligators drown their prey and eat it later doesn't seem accurate based on what I know about their hunting behavior. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,121.39886939999997,0.04432924827625547,0.013015980040468484,0.0,0.0,0.0
30,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether cowpeas and black-eyed peas are the same thing. Let me start by recalling what each of these terms refers to.  Cowpeas as far as I know are a type of legume that's commonly grown in warm climates. They're also known as Southern peas or field peas. The plants produce pods with seeds inside and they come in various colors like green yellow or brown. Cowpeas are used in soups stews and other dishes.  Black-eyed peas on the other hand are a specific type of cowpea. They have a distinctive black spot on each seed which gives them their name. These are often used in Southern cuisine especially in dishes like Hoppin' John which is a traditional New Year's dish in the southern United States.  So from what I understand all black-eyed peas are cowpeas but not all cowpeas are black-eyed peas. Cowpeas encompass a broader category that includes different varieties such as cream peas purple hull peas and others. Black-eyed peas are just one variety within this group.  I should also consider if there's any overlap or confusion in their names. Sometimes terms can be used interchangeably depending on the region or context. For example in some places people might refer to cowpeas as black-eyed peas if that's the most common type they encounter. But generally they are distinct within the broader category.  To double-check I'll think about their scientific names. Cowpeas belong to the species Vigna unguiculata. Black-eyed peas are a specific cultivar within this species often referred to as Vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata var. unguiculata. This classification supports that they're part of the same family but different varieties.  Additionally looking at their culinary uses can help. Cowpeas are used in a variety of dishes across many cultures while black-eyed peas have specific traditional uses especially in Southern American and African cuisines. This further indicates that they are related but not identical.  In summary cowpeas is the broader term and black-eyed peas are a specific type within that category. Therefore they aren't exactly the same thing though closely related. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,122.90197850001277,0.04489383979779957,0.013181755736226717,0.0,0.0,0.0
31,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Isle of Man is part of the European Economic Area (EEA). Let me start by recalling what I know about the EEA. The EEA includes all EU member states plus some other countries like Iceland Liechtenstein and Norway. These non-EU countries are part of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) but have agreed to follow many EU rules through the EEA agreement.  Now where is the Isle of Man? I remember it's a self-governing Crown dependency located between Great Britain and Ireland. It's not part of the UK even though it's under British sovereignty. So does that mean it's part of the EU or the EEA?  I think the Isle of Man isn't in the EU because it doesn't participate in EU institutions. But what about the EEA? The EEA is more about economic integration without political union. Since the Isle of Man isn't an EU member and isn't one of those EFTA countries that joined the EEA I don't think it's part of the EEA either.  Wait but sometimes dependencies have special arrangements. Maybe there are some agreements between the Isle of Man and the EU or EEA countries? I'm not sure about specific trade deals or economic partnerships they might have. However being part of the EEA would mean following a lot of EU regulations which I don't think the Isle of Man does.  So putting it all together: The Isle of Man is a Crown dependency not an EU member and since it's not part of EFTA either it shouldn't be in the EEA. Therefore the answer should be False. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,118.82624540000688,0.0434099362418941,0.012746051098393022,0.0,0.0,0.0

King Louie is the giant ape who wants to take over the jungle. In the original 1967 animated version King Louie appears in the song ""I Wan'na Be Like You"" and tries to get Mowgli to give him the secret of fire. He's a bit comical but also menacing. However I'm not sure if he dies in that version.  Now focusing on the 2016 movie. The plot is similar but more intense. King Louie is portrayed as a more threatening character. In this version Mowgli has to confront him because King Louie wants to take over the jungle and eliminate all humans. There's a big battle scene where Mowgli faces off against King Louie.  I think in the 2016 movie King Louie does die. During the fight Mowgli uses fire to defeat him. I remember seeing a scene where Mowgli sets King Louie on fire causing him to fall and presumably die. This makes sense because it's a more action-packed version compared to the original.  Wait but maybe I'm mixing up details from different versions? Let me think again. In the 2016 film after Mowgli defeats King Louie with fire there's a scene where Baloo and Bagheera find Mowgli and it seems like King Louie is dead because he doesn't appear again. So yes I believe he dies in this version.  I don't recall any other scenes where King Louie comes back or survives. The movie ends with Mowgli leaving the jungle to live among humans so it's likely that King Louie's death was a pivotal point leading to that conclusion. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,118.13298379999469,0.04315291865671781,0.01267058544335064,0.0,0.0,0.0
33,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Dwyane Wade made the playoffs during his rookie year. Let me start by recalling some basic facts about Dwyane Wade's career. He was drafted by the Miami Heat in 2003 right? That would make his rookie season the 2003-2004 NBA season.  Now I remember that making the playoffs depends on how well a team performs during the regular season. The Miami Heat were a relatively young team at that time but they had some established players too. I think Shaquille O'Neal was with them then and maybe Alonzo Mourning as well. But I'm not sure about their performance that year.  I should check how many wins the Heat had in 2003-2004. If they made the playoffs they must have been in the top eight teams in their conference. The Eastern Conference is where Miami plays. Let me think; I believe the Heat had around 42 wins that season. Wait no maybe it was higher? Or lower?  Wait Shaq was with them but he might have been injured part of the time. If they didn't make the playoffs that would mean their record wasn't good enough. Alternatively if they did make it then Dwyane Wade would have had playoff experience as a rookie.  I think I remember something about the Heat missing the playoffs in 2004. They were rebuilding or maybe just didn't have enough depth. So if that's the case then Dwyane Wade wouldn't have made the playoffs his first year.  Alternatively maybe they did make it because of their star players. But I'm leaning towards them not making it because I recall Shaq being traded after that season which might indicate a poor performance.  So putting it all together: Miami Heat in 2003-2004 didn't make the playoffs so Dwyane Wade did not participate in the playoffs during his rookie year. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,122.19725860000472,0.04464060471016649,0.013107400700345271,0.0,0.0,0.0
34,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the dorsal root ganglion carries sensory input. Let me start by recalling what I know about the nervous system structure.  The dorsal root ganglion is part of the spinal nerves. Spinal nerves have two roots: a dorsal (posterior) root and a ventral (anterior) root. The dorsal root is responsible for sensory information while the ventral root handles motor commands.  Dorsal root ganglia are clusters of neuron cell bodies located just outside the spinal cord. These neurons are sensory neurons meaning they're involved in transmitting sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. So when a stimulus occurs—like touching something hot—the sensory receptors detect it and send signals through these neurons.  The process goes like this: sensory input is detected by receptors which then send signals along the axons of these sensory neurons. These axons enter the spinal cord via the dorsal root. The cell bodies are in the ganglion so they're outside the spinal cord but connected to it.  I remember that the ventral roots don't have such ganglia because they're motor pathways; their cell bodies are in the spinal cord itself. So the presence of a ganglion specifically on the dorsal side indicates sensory function.  Therefore yes the dorsal root ganglion does carry sensory input as it's part of the sensory pathway. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,115.3940865000186,0.04216046922252421,0.012379181854773269,0.0,0.0,0.0
35,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether England has ever won the Women's World Cup. Let me start by recalling what I know about the FIFA Women's World Cup. It's a tournament that happens every four years right? The first one was in 1991 if I remember correctly.  Now thinking about which teams have won it. The United States has been pretty dominant winning multiple times. Germany and Japan also come to mind as strong teams with titles. But what about England?  I think England's women's team is quite good but I'm not sure if they've ever lifted the World Cup. They might have made some finals or semifinals in recent years. Let me try to remember specific tournaments.  In 2019 the Women's World Cup was held in France. The final was between the United States and the Netherlands with the US winning. So England wasn't even in that final. What about previous tournaments?  Going back a bit maybe 2015? That was also won by the US. Before that Germany had some wins. I think Germany won in 2007 and 2011. Japan won in 2011 as well right? So up until now the major winners are US Germany Japan.  Wait did England ever make it to a final? They might have been runners-up at some point. Let me think about the years. Maybe in 2019 they were in the semifinals or something. I don't recall them winning though.  Also considering the structure of the tournament and how competitive it is with teams like Brazil France Sweden also being strong contenders it's possible that England hasn't won yet. They might have had some close calls but not the title.  So putting it all together based on my memory of past tournaments and the teams that have won I don't think England has ever won the Women's World Cup. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,126.32492469999124,0.04616878304757399,0.013556105325653042,0.0,0.0,0.0
36,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether finding a four-leaf clover is considered lucky. Let me start by recalling what I know about four-leaf clovers. From what I remember they're often associated with good luck in various cultures and folklore. But why exactly?  I think it's because three-leaf clovers are common so finding one with an extra leaf is rare. Rarity might make people see it as special or lucky. Also in some traditions each leaf has a meaning: the first for faith the second for hope the third for love and the fourth for luck. That adds to its symbolic significance.  I should consider if there are any cultural differences. In Irish culture four-leaf clovers are definitely symbols of good luck. They're often used in St. Patrick's Day decorations. But is this belief universal? I think it's pretty widespread in Western cultures at least. Maybe in other parts of the world too but perhaps not as strongly.  Are there any scientific reasons behind this belief? Well four-leaf clovers are just a mutation or variation of the common three-leaf clover. There's nothing inherently magical about them but their rarity might make people attach significance to finding one. It could be a way to feel a sense of luck or fortune.  I should also think about how this belief is portrayed in media and popular culture. Movies books and games often use four-leaf clovers as symbols of good luck. This reinforces the idea that they're lucky charms. So even if it's not based on any scientific fact the cultural association makes them seem lucky.  Are there any counterpoints? Maybe some people don't believe in superstitions so finding a four-leaf clover wouldn't mean anything to them. But generally the common belief is that it's lucky.   So putting it all together: rarity cultural symbolism and widespread belief all point towards four-leaf clovers being considered lucky. Therefore the answer should be True. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,119.67696719997912,0.043733448739509816,0.012841041028868874,0.0,0.0,0.0
37,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the mafia is still active in New Jersey. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about the mafia. The mafia or organized crime groups have a history in places like New York and New Jersey. They were involved in various illegal activities including gambling drug trafficking and protection rackets.  I remember hearing that in the past New Jersey had a significant presence of mafia families especially the Genovese and Gambino crime families. But I'm not sure if they're still active today. Maybe there have been changes over time due to law enforcement efforts or internal issues within the organizations.  I should consider recent news or reports about organized crime in New Jersey. Have there been any high-profile cases or arrests related to mafia activities? If so that might indicate ongoing activity. On the other hand if there's a lack of recent information it could mean that their influence has diminished.  Also I think about how organized crime adapts. They might have shifted from traditional rackets to more modern illegal activities like cybercrime or human trafficking. This adaptability could mean they're still active but perhaps in different forms than before.  Another angle is the impact of law enforcement operations. Agencies like the FBI and local police have targeted mafia groups leading to convictions and weakening their structures. However it's possible that smaller cells or offshoots continue to operate under the radar.  I should also consider cultural factors. Does New Jersey still have communities where mafia influence could persist? Or has urbanization and demographic changes reduced their traditional bases of power?  Putting this all together while the mafia might not be as prominent as they once were in New Jersey there's likely some level of continued activity albeit perhaps less visible or in different forms. So I think the answer is that yes the mafia is still active but maybe not to the extent it was decades ago. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,125.43073100000038,0.045846443006618644,0.013461459652593752,0.0,0.0,0.0
38,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""Love Child"" is based on a true story. First I should clarify what ""Love Child"" refers to because that term could mean different things depending on context. It might be a movie a book or even a song. Since the user didn't specify I'll assume they're referring to a movie.  I remember there's a South Korean film called ""Love Child"" from 2016 directed by Kim Jee-woon. The plot involves a man who discovers he has a daughter with special abilities and goes on a journey to find her biological mother. Now I need to determine if this story is based on real events or if it's entirely fictional.  I'll start by checking the genre of the movie. It's a thriller with elements of fantasy because of the daughter's special powers. That makes me think it's more likely a work of fiction since thrillers often blend reality with creative twists to keep viewers engaged.  Next I'll look into any interviews or behind-the-scenes information about the film. If the director or writers have mentioned that parts of the story are inspired by real events that would be useful. However from what I know Kim Jee-woon is known for creating original stories rather than adapting true events.  Additionally considering the plot elements—like a daughter with special abilities and the father's quest—it doesn't ring any bells as a documented true story. It seems more like a narrative constructed to explore themes of family identity and supernatural elements.  I should also think about whether there are any real-life cases similar to the plot. While there might be instances where children have unique talents or circumstances that separate them from their parents the specific combination in ""Love Child"" doesn't correspond to any widely known true story.  Moreover if it were based on a true story marketing materials would likely highlight that fact to attract audiences interested in real-life dramas. Since I don't recall such claims for this film it reinforces the idea that it's fictional.  In summary after considering the genre director's background plot elements and lack of references to real events it seems clear that ""Love Child"" is a work of fiction. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,123.56165400001919,0.04517143883849566,0.01326326453038529,0.0,0.0,0.0
39,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if thread seal tape is the same as Teflon tape. Let me start by recalling what each of these tapes is used for and their properties.  Thread seal tape also known as PTFE tape or plumber's tape is commonly used in plumbing to create a watertight seal on pipe threads. It's usually white and has a slightly sticky texture because it's made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) which is another name for Teflon.  Teflon tape specifically refers to the brand name of PTFE tapes produced by DuPont. However in common usage people often refer to any PTFE-based thread sealant as Teflon tape. So while all Teflon tapes are thread seal tapes not all thread seal tapes might be branded as Teflon.  Wait but isn't the main component of both just PTFE? They serve the same purpose: providing a non-reactive slippery surface to prevent leaks and corrosion on threaded connections. The materials are identical in most cases except for branding.  So essentially thread seal tape is another name for Teflon tape because they're made from the same material and used for the same purposes. There might be slight variations in thickness or application methods but fundamentally they're the same product. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,125.92999509998481,0.04604464732964448,0.013519656522893957,0.0,0.0,0.0
41,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether you have to be Mormon to attend BYU. Let me start by recalling what I know about BYU. It's Brigham Young University right? And I think it's associated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which is the Mormon church.  I remember hearing that BYU is a religious institution so maybe there are some requirements related to faith or beliefs for students. But does that mean you have to be Mormon to enroll?  Let me break this down. First what is BYU's official stance on admissions? I think they do require students to adhere to certain standards like the Honor Code which includes things like honesty and following religious guidelines. But does being a member of the LDS Church come into play for admission?  I believe that while many students at BYU are Mormons it's not strictly required to be one to attend. However there might be some expectations or recommendations regarding religious participation. For example students might need to take certain religion classes or participate in church activities.  Wait but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the university has a statement on their website about admissions criteria. Let me think... I recall that BYU is known for its strong religious environment but they do accept students from various backgrounds. They probably have a process where students can declare their faith and commitment to the LDS principles.  So putting it all together: while BYU is a Mormon university it doesn't necessarily require every student to be Mormon. However there are likely expectations regarding adherence to LDS teachings and participation in church activities. Therefore you don't have to be Mormon to attend but there might be some religious requirements or recommendations. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,123.40328090000548,0.04513630798053073,0.013252949387136604,0.0,0.0,0.0
40,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if liquor stores in Oklahoma are open on the 4th of July. Let me start by recalling what I know about Oklahoma's laws regarding alcohol sales and holidays.  First I remember that in many states certain holidays have restrictions on when alcohol can be sold. For example some places might close earlier or not at all on major holidays like Christmas or Independence Day. But I'm not sure about Oklahoma specifically.  I think the 4th of July is a federal holiday so maybe it affects business hours. In Oklahoma I believe that alcohol sales are regulated by the state's Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (ABC). They probably have specific rules about when and how liquor can be sold.  Let me try to remember if there were any recent changes or if I've heard anything about this before. I think in some states like Texas bars and liquor stores close on certain holidays but Oklahoma might handle it differently.  I should consider checking the official ABC website for Oklahoma. They usually have a list of holidays when sales are restricted. From what I recall the 4th of July is one such holiday where alcohol sales might be prohibited or have limited hours.  Wait no maybe that's not entirely accurate. Perhaps on the 4th of July some stores close early but others might still operate with reduced hours. Or maybe it's allowed to sell alcohol as long as it's before a certain time in the morning.  I'm getting a bit confused now. Let me think about other holidays. For example Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve often have earlier closing times for liquor stores. Maybe the 4th of July is similar with sales stopping at midnight or something like that.  Alternatively maybe Oklahoma allows alcohol sales on the 4th but just has restrictions on when they can be sold. I'm not entirely sure if it's a complete closure or just limited hours.  I think I should look up the specific rules for Oklahoma. But since I don't have access to external information right now I'll have to rely on my memory. From what I remember Oklahoma does restrict alcohol sales on certain holidays including the 4th of July. So liquor stores might be closed or have limited hours that day.  Wait but maybe it's only for retail stores and not all types of establishments. For example grocery stores with alcohol sections might still be open while standalone liquor stores are closed. Or perhaps it's the opposite.  I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to piece this together. If Oklahoma prohibits alcohol sales on the 4th of July then liquor stores would be closed. But if they allow sales under certain conditions like before a specific time then some might still operate.  Another angle: I think in Oklahoma the sale of alcohol is prohibited from midnight until noon on certain holidays including the 4th of July. That means that while stores can't sell alcohol during that period they might be open again after noon.  So if that's the case then technically liquor stores are open on the 4th but only in the afternoon and evening not all day. But the question is whether they're open at all. So yes they are open part of the day.  Wait no maybe I'm mixing it up with another state. Let me think again. In Oklahoma the ABC laws might state that alcohol sales are prohibited on certain days including the 4th of July. That would mean liquor stores are closed entirely on that day.  I'm not entirely confident about this but based on what I remember I think Oklahoma does have restrictions on alcohol sales on the 4th of July which would mean that liquor stores are closed. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,133.29266910001752,0.048762389188856725,0.014317641491513426,0.0,0.0,0.0
42,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Dr. Burke comes back after Season 3 of ""The Good Doctor."" Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. Dr. Murphy is a main character but I'm not sure about Dr. Burke. Wait maybe that's a mix-up. I think Dr. Murphy is the one who is autistic and works at the hospital. But the question is about Dr. Burke.  I should check if there was a Dr. Burke in Season 3. From what I remember Season 3 had several storylines involving different doctors. There was Dr. Murphy Dr. Murphy's friend and some other characters. Wait maybe Dr. Burke isn't a main character but appears in a few episodes.  I think Dr. Burke might have been introduced as a new attending physician or someone who works with the team. If he appeared in Season 3 did he leave after that? Or was there any indication of him returning in later seasons?  Looking up some information I recall that Dr. Burke is actually a recurring character played by Richard Schiff. He's part of the administration at the hospital maybe as an administrator or someone in a higher position. So if he appeared in Season 3 it's possible he came back in subsequent seasons.  Wait but does he come back after Season 3? I think he was involved in some storylines that continued beyond Season 3. For example there were plot points about hospital politics and leadership changes which might involve Dr. Burke again.  Alternatively maybe he only appeared in a few episodes of Season 3 and didn't return later. I'm not entirely sure without checking specific episode guides or summaries. But based on my memory I think Dr. Burke does come back after Season 3 because his role as an administrator would likely require him to appear in multiple seasons.  So putting it all together I believe the answer is True. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,125.39471529997536,0.0458839692420201,0.01347247812797902,0.0,0.0,0.0
44,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the right atrium receives blood from the lungs. Let me start by recalling what I know about the human heart and circulation.  The heart has four chambers: two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers). The right side of the heart deals with deoxygenated blood while the left side handles oxygenated blood.   Blood from the body comes into the heart through the superior and inferior vena cava which empty into the right atrium. From there it goes to the right ventricle then gets pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs for oxygenation.  On the other hand after the blood is oxygenated in the lungs it returns via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium. So the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs not the right atrium.  Wait so if that's correct then the right atrium doesn't receive blood directly from the lungs. It only gets deoxygenated blood from the body through the vena cava. The oxygenated blood goes to the left side of the heart.  I think I might have confused this before because sometimes diagrams can be a bit misleading but in reality the flow is right atrium → right ventricle → lungs (via pulmonary artery) and then back from lungs via pulmonary veins to left atrium. So yes the right atrium doesn't receive blood directly from the lungs. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,127.80069630002254,0.04676793746623802,0.013732029399661462,0.0,0.0,0.0
43,"<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether a dog can be mixed with three breeds. Hmm let's break this down step by step.  First I know that when we talk about dog breeds they're categorized based on their lineage and characteristics. A purebred dog comes from parents of the same breed but when you mix different breeds you get a mixed-breed or crossbreed dog.   Now the question is asking if a dog can be mixed with three breeds. I think this means whether a single dog can have three different breeds in its lineage. So for example could a dog's parents each be from two different breeds and then one of those parents themselves being a mix of another breed?  Let me consider how breeding works. If you have a dog that is already a mix of two breeds say a Labradoodle (Labrador Retriever and Poodle) and then you breed that Labradoodle with another breed like a Golden Retriever the resulting puppies would have three breeds in their lineage: Labrador Poodle and Golden Retriever. So each puppy would be a mix of all three.  But wait is there any biological limitation to this? I don't think so because dogs can interbreed regardless of breed as long as they're compatible. Each generation just adds another layer of genetic diversity. So in theory you could have a dog that's a mix of three breeds by breeding a crossbred dog with another purebred.  However sometimes people might refer to the number of breeds in a specific way. For instance a first-generation cross is two breeds and beyond that it's considered more mixed but not necessarily ""three breeds"" unless each parent specifically contributes a different breed. But in practice if you have a dog whose grandparents include three distinct breeds then yes that dog would be a mix of those three.  I should also consider the term ""mixed with."" Does this mean intentionally breeding to combine three breeds or does it refer to naturally occurring mixes? Either way as long as each parent contributes a different breed you can end up with a dog that has three breeds in its background.  So putting it all together yes a dog can be mixed with three breeds through intentional breeding where each generation introduces a new breed. Therefore the answer should be True. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,131.1206203000038,0.04797677485971685,0.014086968948548878,0.0,0.0,0.0
45,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether a ""certification of birth"" is the same as a ""birth certificate."" Hmm let me break this down.  First I know that a birth certificate is an official document issued by a government agency that records someone's birth. It usually includes details like the person's name date and place of birth parents' names etc. People use it for legal purposes like applying for a passport or Social Security card.  Now what about a ""certification of birth""? The term sounds similar but might have slight differences. I think ""certification"" generally means an official statement that something is true. So a certification of birth would be an official document stating that someone was born but maybe it's not exactly the same as a birth certificate.  Wait could they be interchangeable? Or does one serve a different purpose? Maybe in some contexts a certification of birth might be used instead of a traditional birth certificate especially if the original certificate is lost or unavailable. It might still contain similar information but perhaps isn't issued by the same authority or has a slightly different format.  I should also consider legal definitions. In many places a birth certificate is a specific type of document with particular requirements. A certification of birth might be an alternative that serves a similar purpose but under different circumstances. For example if someone was born outside of a hospital or in a situation where the standard birth certificate isn't available they might get a certification instead.  But does this mean they're essentially the same? Or are there key differences in their usage and recognition? I think both documents serve to prove someone's identity and birth details but they might be issued under different conditions. However legally they should both be accepted as proof of birth since they provide the necessary information.  So putting it all together while the names sound similar there might be slight differences in how they're obtained or their specific uses. But for most practical purposes especially legal ones a certification of birth and a birth certificate are treated similarly because they both serve to verify someone's birth details. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,133.22959019997506,0.0487653861008052,0.01431852144656841,0.0,0.0,0.0
46,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether every country has its own sign language. Hmm let's start by thinking about what a sign language is. Sign languages are visual languages used primarily by deaf communities. They have their own grammar and syntax just like spoken languages.  Now considering that there are over 190 countries in the world does each one have a distinct sign language? I know that some countries share similar or even identical sign languages because of historical ties or cultural similarities. For example American Sign Language (ASL) is used not only in the United States but also in parts of Canada and other regions where ASL has influenced local deaf communities.  Wait but does every single country have at least one? I'm trying to think if there are any countries without a recognized sign language. Maybe some smaller or less developed nations might rely on international sign languages rather than having their own. But then again even in those places there's likely some form of local sign language perhaps not as standardized but still present.  Also considering that deaf people exist everywhere it makes sense that they would develop a way to communicate which could evolve into a sign language specific to their region or country. However I'm not entirely sure if every country has an officially recognized one. Some might have multiple dialects or regional variations within the same country.  Another angle is considering countries with very small deaf populations. Maybe in such cases they don't have a distinct sign language but instead use a form of another country's sign language or a gestural system that isn't fully developed into a language. But I think even in those situations some form of communication exists which could be considered a sign language.  I'm also recalling that some countries might not have an established sign language because they might rely on oral methods or other forms of communication due to cultural reasons. However the presence of deaf communities usually leads to the development of sign languages over time.  So putting it all together while there are variations and shared languages across borders every country likely has some form of sign language used by its deaf community. It might not be as standardized or widely recognized as in larger countries but it exists. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,131.23208649997832,0.048041523624022586,0.014105980518936818,0.0,0.0,0.0
47,"<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether ""dry water"" actually exists. At first glance the term sounds a bit contradictory because water is usually associated with being wet. But maybe it's referring to something else.  I remember hearing about something called ""dry ice "" which isn't actually ice but solid carbon dioxide. So perhaps ""dry water"" is similar in that it's not regular water. Maybe it's a substance that has properties of water without the liquid form.   I think I've heard about dry water in some scientific contexts. It might be a type of gel or powder that contains water but doesn't feel wet. This could be useful for things like storing water in areas where moisture is an issue or maybe in certain industrial applications.  Wait another thought: there's also something called ""dry water"" used in chemistry as a catalyst. I think it involves encapsulating water droplets in a sand-like structure making it easier to handle and use in reactions without the mess of liquid water. That makes sense because it would keep the water contained but not wet.  So putting this together dry water does exist.

Hmm I remember that the United States has something called the National Minimum Drinking Age Act which was passed in 1984. This act requires all states to set their minimum drinking age at 21 or face penalties like losing federal highway funding. But wait does every single state actually comply with this? I think most do because they don't want to lose that money.   But then again maybe some states have exceptions or special cases where people under 21 can drink legally. For example I've heard about religious ceremonies or medical reasons allowing underage drinking in certain places. Also what about the territories like Puerto Rico or Guam? Are they included in this law? I'm not entirely sure if all U.S. territories follow the same rule as the states.  Another thing to consider is whether any state has a different minimum age for purchasing alcohol versus consuming it. Maybe some states allow people under 21 to drink in private settings like at home with parental consent but still require ID when buying from stores or bars. So even if the legal drinking age is 21 everywhere there might be exceptions based on location and circumstances.  Wait I should check if all 50 states have exactly the same minimum drinking age without any variations. From what I recall yes they do because of that federal law. But maybe some states have additional rules or loopholes. For instance in some places you can drink at a younger age if it's for educational purposes or with family supervision. However these exceptions don't change the overall minimum drinking age; they just provide specific circumstances where it's allowed.  So putting it all together: The National Minimum Drinking Age Act mandates 21 as the minimum across all states to receive federal highway funds. States that don't comply risk losing funding so most have adopted 21. While there are exceptions in some states for certain situations the general rule is 21 everywhere. Therefore it's accurate to say that all states enforce a minimum drinking age of 21. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,133.66430889998446,0.04893770832928088,0.014369118800992077,0.0,0.0,0.0
49,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there are tolls on I-70 in Kansas. Let me start by recalling what I know about toll roads. Tolls are fees charged for using certain highways or bridges usually to fund their construction and maintenance.  I remember that many states have toll roads especially in the eastern US like Pennsylvania New Jersey etc. But I'm not sure about Kansas. I think Kansas is a state in the Midwest so maybe they don't have as many toll roads as other regions.  I-70 is a major interstate highway that runs from Colorado to Maryland. It passes through several states including Kansas. Now do any parts of I-70 in Kansas have tolls? I'm trying to recall if there are any specific sections where tolls are collected. Maybe near cities like Topeka or Wichita?  Wait I think most of the interstate highways in Kansas are funded by state and federal taxes not tolls. Tolls might be more common on bridges or turnpikes but I don't remember hearing about tolls on I-70 specifically.  Let me also consider if there have been recent changes. Sometimes states introduce toll roads for new projects or to fund repairs. But as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023 I don't recall any tolls being implemented on I-70 in Kansas.  So putting it all together: I don't think there are tolls on I-70 in Kansas. The highway is likely funded through other means so drivers wouldn't have to pay a toll when traveling through that section. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,124.01992349998909,0.045407520623296865,0.01333258300336595,0.0,0.0,0.0
51,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Trinity Forest Golf Club is a public course. Let me start by recalling what I know about golf courses. Public courses are typically open to the general public and don't require membership to play. Private clubs on the other hand usually require membership or special access.  Trinity Forest Golf Club sounds familiar because it's known for hosting major events like the PGA Tour's Byron Nelson Championship. That makes me think it's a high-profile course which might be private. I remember that some top-tier courses are private and not open to everyone.   I should check if Trinity Forest is listed as public or private. From what I recall they have different memberships but also allow daily fee access. Wait no actually I think it's more exclusive. They require a membership for regular play which would make it a private club rather than public.  So putting it all together: since it requires membership and isn't open to the general public without restrictions Trinity Forest Golf Club is likely a private course. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,119.62159220001195,0.04379602832118665,0.01285941568257314,0.0,0.0,0.0
50,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""A Mountain Between Us"" is based on a true story. Let me start by recalling what I know about the movie. It's a 2017 film starring Kate Winslet and Idris Elba. The plot involves a couple who get stranded in the Swiss Alps after their plane crashes and they have to survive together despite their rocky relationship.  I think the first step is to check if there was an actual incident that inspired this movie. Sometimes movies are based on real events or even true stories but sometimes they're completely fictional. I remember hearing that some survival movies are inspired by real-life events like ""127 Hours"" or ""The Revenant "" which were based on true stories.  Looking into it a bit more I recall that ""A Mountain Between Us"" is actually an adaptation of a novel. The book was written by Charles Martin and was published in 2014. So the movie is based on a fictional story from the book. That suggests that while the events are dramatic and realistic they aren't based on something that actually happened.  I should also consider if there's any real-life incident similar to the plot. Plane crashes in mountains do happen but I don't recall a specific crash where two people were stranded like this. The story seems more like a fictional setup to explore themes of survival and relationships rather than a recounting of actual events.  Additionally the characters' backgrounds and their relationship issues are elements that are common in fiction to create conflict and drive the narrative. There's no indication from what I know that these specific characters or their circumstances were real people or events.  So putting it all together: The movie is based on a novel which is a work of fiction. Therefore ""A Mountain Between Us"" isn't a true story but rather a fictional account inspired by the author's imagination. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,130.61848219996318,0.04782662353327563,0.01404288142746507,0.0,0.0,0.0
53,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether money from Guernsey is legal tender in the UK. Let me start by understanding what each of these terms means.  First Guernsey is a Crown dependency right? It's not part of the United Kingdom but has its own government and currency. The UK on the other hand uses the pound sterling as its official currency. Now legal tender refers to money that must be accepted if offered to settle a debt. So if someone owes you money in the UK they can't refuse payment in pounds.  Guernsey's currency is also called the pound but it's specifically the Guernsey pound. I think these are different from the UK pounds because they're issued by Guernsey's government and not the Bank of England. But wait aren't some Crown dependencies like Jersey or Man using their own versions of the pound that are pegged to the UK pound? So maybe they have similar value but are separate currencies.  I remember reading somewhere that while Guernsey pounds can be used in Guernsey they might not be accepted as legal tender in the UK. That makes sense because each country or dependency has its own currency regulations. The UK's laws specify which currencies are considered legal tender there and I don't think Guernsey's is one of them.  But then again sometimes people use foreign currencies informally like in tourist areas or specific businesses that accept them. However legally speaking if you try to pay a debt with Guernsey pounds in the UK the creditor isn't obligated to accept it. They can insist on payment in UK pounds instead.  So putting this together: Guernsey's currency is not recognized as legal tender in the UK. Therefore the answer should be False. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,120.1071113999933,0.04398168353717681,0.012913927876659478,0.0,0.0,0.0
52,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the away goal counts in the playoffs. Hmm let me think about this step by step.  First what is an away goal? In football (soccer) an away goal is a goal scored by a team when they are playing as the visiting team. It's significant because in some competitions especially two-legged ties like in cup competitions or certain league formats away goals can have extra weight. For example if two teams are tied on aggregate after both legs the team with more away goals might advance.  Now the question is about playoffs. Playoffs usually refer to a series of games played to determine a champion or to decide which teams qualify for a higher division or competition. The structure can vary depending on the league or tournament rules.  In some leagues like the English Premier League there isn't a playoff system because they don't use two-legged ties in their main competitions. However other leagues do have playoffs such as the Championship (the second tier in England) which uses a playoff to decide who gets promoted to the Premier League.  In those playoffs especially when it's a two-legged semifinal or final away goals can be crucial. If both legs end with the same scoreline the team that scored more away goals might win. But if the competition doesn't use aggregate scoring but instead has a single game or uses extra time and penalties then away goals wouldn't matter as much.  Wait but in some cases even in playoffs they might have two-legged ties where away goals count towards the aggregate. For example in the Champions League knockout stages away goals are important because if the scores are tied after both legs the team with more away goals advances. But is that the case in all playoffs?  I think it depends on the specific competition's rules. Some might use away goals as a tiebreaker while others don't. So without knowing the exact playoff structure being referred to it's hard to say definitively.  But generally in many football playoffs that involve two legs (home and away) away goals do count towards the aggregate score. Therefore they can influence the outcome if the total goals are equal. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,128.38001690001693,0.04700276076797968,0.013800978356103465,0.0,0.0,0.0
55,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the transmission and the engine are the same thing. Let me start by recalling what each of these components does in a vehicle.  The engine is the part that generates power. It's often called the ""heart"" of the car because it converts fuel into mechanical energy through combustion processes. Engines can be internal combustion engines which burn fuel inside cylinders to create power or they could be electric motors in hybrid or electric vehicles.  On the other hand the transmission is responsible for transferring that power from the engine to the wheels. It's like the middleman between the engine and the driving wheels. The transmission adjusts the gear ratios so that the car can move efficiently at different speeds. There are manual transmissions where the driver shifts gears manually and automatic transmissions that do this automatically.  So while both the engine and transmission are crucial for a vehicle's operation they serve distinct functions. The engine creates power and the transmission manages how that power is delivered to the wheels. Without an engine there would be no power to move the car but without a transmission the power wouldn't be effectively utilized or controlled.  I don't think they're the same because their roles are different. They work together but aren't interchangeable. The engine's job is about generating energy and the transmission's job is about distributing and controlling that energy for movement. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,116.44157850000192,0.04264304855246541,0.01252087708243229,0.0,0.0,0.0
54,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" is an autobiography. Let me start by recalling what I know about this book. The title sounds familiar; I think it's a memoir or something similar. Maya Angelou wrote it right? She was a well-known poet and author.  Now what defines an autobiography? It's a written account of someone's life typically by that person themselves. So if Maya Angelou wrote about her own experiences then yes it would be an autobiography. But wait sometimes people write memoirs which are similar but might focus on specific periods or themes rather than the entire life.  I remember reading that ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" covers a significant portion of her early life including her childhood and some challenging experiences she went through. It's not just a collection of random memories; it seems to follow a narrative structure detailing her growth and development over time.  Also I think this book is part of a series where Maya Angelou recounts different phases of her life. So each book might cover specific years or events but together they form a comprehensive autobiography. Therefore ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" can be considered an autobiography as it's her personal account of her early life experiences.  Another point is that autobiographies often include reflections on personal growth and identity which I believe this book does. It discusses themes like racism identity and self-worth all through her own perspective. That aligns with the purpose of an autobiography which is to share one's journey and insights.  I don't recall any indication that it's a fictionalized account or based on someone else's life. All references I've come across suggest it's her true story. So putting it all together yes it's an autobiography. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,131.20273760001874,0.0480587282798931,0.014111032160147112,0.0,0.0,0.0
56,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Canadian dollar (CAD) is worth more than the US dollar (USD). Hmm where do I start? Well I know that currency values fluctuate based on various factors like economic performance interest rates and global events. But right now as of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023 what's the exchange rate?  I remember that a few years back CAD was almost at par with USD maybe even slightly higher for a short period. But I think more recently CAD has been weaker compared to USD. Let me try to recall specific numbers. If I'm not mistaken around mid-2023 1 CAD was worth about 0.75 USD or so. That would mean that the US dollar is stronger because you need more CAD to get one USD.  Wait but exchange rates can change daily right? So if someone asks this question now it might be different. But since I'm supposed to answer based on my knowledge up until October 2023 I should stick with what was accurate then. Also considering factors like Canada's commodity exports and the US's economic policies which can influence their currencies.  Another angle: looking at purchasing power. If CAD is worth more than USD that would mean you can buy more goods in the US with one CAD than you can in Canada with one USD. But I think the opposite has been true for a while now—USD tends to have higher purchasing power internationally because it's a global reserve currency.  I should also consider interest rates. If the US has higher interest rates that can attract foreign investment and strengthen the USD against other currencies like CAD. I believe the US Federal Reserve had raised rates in recent years which would contribute to USD being stronger.  Putting this all together as of my knowledge cutoff the Canadian dollar was worth less than the US dollar. So the answer should be False. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,127.94671980000567,0.04687229584915123,0.013762671169641156,0.0,0.0,0.0
58,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether there's ever been a perfect tennis match. Hmm what does ""perfect"" even mean in this context? Maybe it refers to a match where one player won without losing any points or games. That would be pretty much impossible because even the best players make mistakes sometimes.  I remember hearing about some really dominant performances like when Rafael Nadal won Wimbledon with just three losses in sets but that's not perfect. Or maybe Serena Williams had some dominant matches too. But those still involved winning and losing points; it's just that one player was way better than the other.  Wait could a perfect match mean something else? Like both players playing flawlessly making no mistakes? That seems even more unlikely because tennis is a sport where errors are part of the game. Even top players have double faults or misjudged shots occasionally.  I think in terms of scoring a perfect match would require one player to win all their service games and break serve every time. But I don't recall any professional matches where that happened. The closest might be when a player wins 6-0 in both sets but even then they probably lost some points within those games.  Also considering the rules of tennis you can't have zero points lost because each game requires at least four points to win and there are multiple games per set. So for someone to lose no points would mean winning every single point which is practically impossible in a competitive match.  So putting it all together I don't think there's ever been a perfect tennis match where one player won without losing any points or games. It just doesn't happen because of the nature of the sport and human error. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,124.50533580000047,0.04563195403515371,0.01339848127420822,0.0,0.0,0.0
59,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Mickey and Minnie's house is still located in Magic Kingdom. Let me start by recalling what I know about Magic Kingdom. It's a theme park at Walt Disney World in Florida right? I remember that there are various themed lands within the park like Main Street USA Adventureland Frontierland Fantasyland and Tomorrowland.  Now Mickey and Minnie's house... Hmm I think it was part of the Magic Kingdom when it first opened. I believe it was located in Fantasyland because that's where a lot of the classic Disney characters have their attractions. The house was probably designed to be a meet-and-greet spot for kids to interact with Mickey and Minnie Mouse.  But wait I've heard about changes over the years. Maybe they moved or closed some attractions. Let me think... There was something called ""Mickey's Toontown"" that opened in 2014. That area replaced parts of Fantasyland including the old Mickey and Minnie's house. So if Toontown is now there does that mean the original house isn't anymore?  I should also consider whether they just renovated it or moved it elsewhere. But from what I remember when Toontown came in they introduced new attractions like ""Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway."" That ride replaced some older ones so maybe the old house was demolished to make way for this new ride.  So putting it all together: Mickey and Minnie's original house was in Fantasyland but got replaced when Toontown opened. Therefore it's no longer there. But wait does that mean there isn't any house at all? Or is there a different one now?  I think the old house was removed and now they have new areas in Toontown where Mickey and Minnie are still present but not in the same house as before. So the original house isn't there anymore. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,132.46716229995945,0.04856002980054145,0.014258224608490758,0.0,0.0,0.0
57,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is a prequel. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Indiana Jones movies.  First there are four main films featuring Indiana Jones as the protagonist. The first one was ""Raiders of the Lost Ark "" released in 1981. Then came ""The Temple of Doom"" in 1984 followed by ""The Last Crusade"" in 1989 and finally ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" in 2008.  Now a prequel is a story that takes place before the events of another work. So I need to determine if ""Temple of Doom"" happens before ""Raiders.""   In ""Raiders "" Indiana Jones is searching for the Ark of the Covenant during World War II. The movie starts in 1936 and ends in 1945 when the Ark is hidden at the end of the war.  Looking at ""Temple of Doom "" it's set in India right after the events of ""Raiders."" Wait no actually I think it's supposed to take place a few years before ""Raiders."" Let me check. In ""Temple of Doom "" Indy is searching for the Sankara Stones and the movie ends with him finding them in India. The timeline isn't explicitly stated but considering that ""Raiders"" starts in 1936 I think ""Temple of Doom"" might be set around 1935 or so.  Wait no actually I'm a bit confused now. Some sources say that ""Temple of Doom"" is a sequel because it follows the events after ""Raiders."" But others argue that it's a prequel because it shows earlier adventures before the main trilogy. Hmm this is conflicting.  Let me think about the order in which they were released and how they're connected. The first movie was ""Raiders "" then ""Temple of Doom"" came next. So chronologically as per release order it's a sequel. But in terms of story timeline does it take place before or after?  In ""Raiders "" Indy is already an established archaeologist and professor. In ""Temple of Doom "" he's still working for the government but I don't recall any direct indication that it's set before ""Raiders."" Actually in ""The Last Crusade "" which is definitely a sequel there are references to events from ""Raiders.""  Wait maybe I should look at specific scenes or dialogues. In ""Temple of Doom "" Indy mentions something about the Ark being hidden by the Nazis which was the main plot of ""Raiders."" That suggests that ""Temple of Doom"" is set after ""Raiders."" But that doesn't make sense because ""Raiders"" came first.  Alternatively perhaps it's a prequel in terms of showing earlier adventures but not necessarily before the events of ""Raiders."" Maybe it's more like a side story. I'm getting confused here.  Another angle: looking at the character ages. In ""Raiders "" Indy is around 38 years old (born in 1902). If ""Temple of Doom"" is set before that he would be younger. But in ""Temple of Doom "" he's still portrayed as an adult so it's hard to tell.  Wait I think the key point is that ""Temple of Doom"" was intended as a sequel but ended up being more like a prequel because it shows earlier adventures before the main trilogy. Or maybe not. Some fans consider it a prequel because it doesn't directly follow ""Raiders "" but others see it as part of the same timeline.  I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to summarize: If ""Temple of Doom"" is set before ""Raiders "" then it's a prequel. If it's after it's a sequel. But since ""Raiders"" was made first and ""Temple of Doom"" came next it's more likely a sequel in the series but not necessarily in timeline.  Wait no actually I think ""Temple of Doom"" is considered a prequel because it shows events that happen before ""Raiders."" For example in ""The Last Crusade "" Indy refers to the Sankara Stones from ""Temple of Doom "" implying that those events happened earlier. So maybe ""Temple of Doom"" is set before ""Raiders.""  But I'm not entirely sure. Some sources say it's a sequel because it was made after but others argue it's a prequel in terms of timeline.  Wait another thought: the original plan for the series was that ""Raiders"" would be followed by sequels but due to creative differences ""Temple of Doom"" ended up being more like a prequel. So perhaps it is intended as a prequel.  I think I need to conclude based on this analysis. Given that ""The Last Crusade"" refers back to events in ""Temple of Doom "" it's likely that ""Temple of Doom"" is set before ""Raiders."" Therefore it would be considered a prequel. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,142.4880078000133,0.05222779049862696,0.015335154669248568,0.0,0.0,0.0
60,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether chewing tobacco is banned in Major League Baseball (MLB). Let me start by recalling what I know about MLB's policies on substances like chewing tobacco.  I remember that MLB has been concerned about the health risks associated with smokeless or chewing tobacco. They've probably taken steps to regulate its use especially considering public health awareness and the influence they have on young athletes.  In recent years there have been stricter rules in sports regarding performance-enhancing drugs and other substances. I think MLB might have banned chewing tobacco as part of these efforts. But wait is it completely banned or just restricted?  I should consider if there are any exceptions or specific policies. For example maybe they allow certain types or under certain conditions. Or perhaps the ban applies only to players during games but not in other settings.  Looking into it more I recall that MLB has had a policy against chewing tobacco for quite some time. They might have implemented this to prevent health issues among players and set a good example. However enforcement can sometimes be inconsistent so while it's banned there might still be instances where players use it discreetly.  Another angle is the comparison with other sports leagues. For instance the NFL has strict policies against chewing tobacco as well. So if MLB follows similar trends it makes sense that they would have a ban in place.  I should also think about any recent news or updates. Maybe there was a specific year when the ban was enforced more strictly. I believe the ban is comprehensive covering all forms of smokeless tobacco during games and team activities.  In summary considering MLB's focus on health and safety along with policies against harmful substances it's likely that chewing tobacco is banned in Major League Baseball. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,133.27609010000015,0.048855058462142525,0.014344851098225813,0.0,0.0,0.0
61,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether there's still a water crisis in Cape Town. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic. I remember hearing a few years ago that Cape Town was facing an severe drought and was at risk of running out of water which they called ""Day Zero."" That was around 2017-2018 if I'm not mistaken.  Since then I think the situation improved because of conservation efforts and some rainfall. But does that mean the crisis is completely over? Or are there still underlying issues?  I should consider factors like current water levels in reservoirs recent weather patterns government responses and any ongoing challenges. Cape Town relies heavily on dams for its water supply so if those dams are at a healthy level now maybe the immediate crisis has passed.  However climate change could be affecting rainfall patterns making droughts more frequent or severe. Also population growth and increased water demand might strain resources even if there's enough water right now.  I should check recent news or reports about Cape Town's water situation. From what I've heard recently they're not in immediate danger of Day Zero again but there are still concerns about long-term water management and infrastructure. There might be localized issues or areas where water access is problematic despite overall improvements.  So putting it all together: while the acute crisis that threatened Day Zero has been averted Cape Town still faces challenges related to water sustainability. Therefore saying there's ""still"" a water crisis might depend on how one defines it—whether it's an immediate emergency or ongoing management issues. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,124.78170739999041,0.04573452589077612,0.013428598482990444,0.0,0.0,0.0
63,"<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether Beckett ever finds out who killed her mom in the TV show ""Castle."" Let me start by recalling what I know about the series.  Beckett is a main character Detective Kate Beckett and throughout the series she's searching for her mother's murderer. Her mom was killed when Kate was just 13 years old so it's a significant part of her backstory. The show revolves around her working with Richard Castle an author to solve various crimes while also dealing with her personal quest.  I remember that in the early seasons there are hints and clues about who might be involved. There's a character named Greg Johnson who is mentioned as a suspect early on. I think he was a friend of Beckett's mom but I'm not entirely sure if he's the actual killer or just another red herring.  As the series progresses especially in later seasons there are more developments. I believe that towards the end they do uncover who killed her mother. It might be someone unexpected perhaps someone close to Kate or her family. The show does a good job of keeping viewers guessing and building suspense around this mystery.  I also recall that Beckett's quest for justice is a central theme so it makes sense that by the series finale she would find closure regarding her mother's murder. It wouldn't make sense for such an important plotline to remain unresolved especially since it's tied into her character development and motivations throughout the show.  So putting this together I think yes Beckett does eventually find out who killed her mom. The show probably reveals the murderer in one of the later episodes or towards the end of the series providing a satisfying conclusion for her journey. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,121.84447310000542,0.044656255085014585,0.013111995972644484,0.0,0.0,0.0
62,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Guitar Center and Musician's Friend are the same company. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two companies.  Guitar Center is a well-known name in the music retail industry. They have physical stores where you can buy guitars amps accessories and other musical instruments. I've heard they also offer lessons and repairs. On the other hand Musician's Friend seems like an online retailer that sells similar products—guitars drums keyboards etc.—but I'm not sure if they have physical locations.  I think Guitar Center might be more of a bricks-and-mortar store with a strong online presence as well. Musician's Friend from what I remember is primarily an online store without the same level of physical retail outlets. But maybe they're related somehow?  Wait could they be subsidiaries or part of the same parent company? Sometimes companies acquire others to expand their reach. Let me think about any news or information I've come across regarding mergers or acquisitions in this sector.  I recall that Guitar Center has been around for a while and expanded quite a bit. Musician's Friend also seems established but perhaps they were acquired by Guitar Center at some point? Or maybe it's the other way around?  Alternatively they could be competitors offering similar products but operating independently. I don't remember seeing any official announcements stating that they're the same company so that might not be the case.  Another angle: checking their websites or official statements. If I were to look up Guitar Center's ownership would it mention Musician's Friend as a subsidiary? Similarly does Musician's Friend list Guitar Center as part of their corporate structure?  I think they are separate entities but might have some overlapping services or product lines. For example both sell musical instruments online and in stores (if applicable). However being the same company would mean shared ownership and management which I don't believe is the case.  So putting it all together: Guitar Center and Musician's Friend operate in the same industry but are distinct companies with their own structures. Therefore they aren't the same company. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,134.44016780002858,0.049260072398514196,0.014463771529248527,0.0,0.0,0.0
64,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if any Civil War battles were fought in Florida. Hmm I remember that the American Civil War was mainly between the Union and the Confederacy and it took place from 1861 to 1865. Florida was a Confederate state but I'm not sure how much fighting actually happened there.  I think most of the major battles were in places like Virginia Pennsylvania and Tennessee. But maybe there were some skirmishes or smaller conflicts in Florida. I recall something about Fort Pickens being involved which is in Florida. Was that part of the Civil War?  Wait Fort Pickens was a Union stronghold during the war. There might have been some action there but was it considered a battle? Or was it more like a siege or just a strategic point without much fighting? I'm not entirely sure.  Also Florida's geography is mostly flat and has a lot of swamps and coastal areas. Maybe that made it less of a target for major battles compared to other states with more strategic locations. But then again control over ports and naval bases could have been important.  I should check if there were any significant battles in Florida. I think the Battle of Olustee was fought in Florida. That sounds familiar. It was in 1864 right? So that would be a Civil War battle in Florida. There might have been others as well but at least one is confirmed.  So putting it all together yes there were Civil War battles fought in Florida such as the Battle of Olustee. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,131.4333670999913,0.04817418491880759,0.014144932606603712,0.0,0.0,0.0
65,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether minors can receive the death penalty. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic. I remember hearing that some countries still use capital punishment but I'm not sure about the specifics regarding age.  First I should consider different regions because laws vary. In the United States for example there was a Supreme Court case called Roper v. Simmons in 2005. That case ruled that executing minors is unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. So in the U.S. minors can't be sentenced to death.  But what about other countries? I think some countries still allow it but maybe not all. For instance Iran and Saudi Arabia have been reported to execute minors in the past. However international law like the Convention on the Rights of the Child prohibits capital punishment for those under 18. But not all countries are signatories or comply with this.  So globally it's possible but depends on the country's laws. In some places minors can be sentenced to death while in others it's strictly prohibited. Therefore the answer isn't a straightforward yes or no without context. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,118.50391140001011,0.04342765045532209,0.012751252356194068,0.0,0.0,0.0
67,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the boiling point is a characteristic property of matter. Hmm let's start by understanding what a characteristic property is. From what I remember characteristic properties are traits that help identify substances and don't change regardless of the amount you have. Examples include things like color density melting point and boiling point.  Wait but why do we consider these as characteristic? Because they're intrinsic to the substance itself right? So if I take water its boiling point is 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure. No matter how much water you have whether it's a drop or an ocean that boiling point remains the same. That makes sense because it's a property of the water molecules themselves and their intermolecular forces.  But then again I remember that external factors like pressure can affect the boiling point. For example at higher altitudes where atmospheric pressure is lower water boils at a lower temperature. So does that mean boiling point isn't always consistent? Or is it still considered characteristic because under standard conditions it's fixed?  I think the key here is ""characteristic property"" refers to properties measured under specific conditions usually standard ones like 1 atm pressure. So even though external factors can change the boiling point under controlled conditions it serves as a reliable identifier for substances.  So putting it all together: Boiling point is a characteristic property because it's an intrinsic trait that identifies a substance when measured under defined conditions. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,119.73412760000792,0.04387606520194178,0.012882916158735469,0.0,0.0,0.0
66,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Trinidad and Tobago were part of the World Cup in 2018. Let me start by recalling what I know about the World Cup. The FIFA World Cup is held every four years right? So 2018 was a World Cup year with the tournament taking place in Russia.  Now I remember that each World Cup has 32 teams participating. These teams qualify through various regional tournaments and playoffs. For the 2018 edition the qualifiers were from different confederations like UEFA (Europe) CONMEBOL (South America) CONCACAF (North and Central America and the Caribbean) CAF (Africa) AFC (Asia) and OFC (Oceania).  Trinidad and Tobago is a country in the Caribbean so they fall under the CONCACAF region. I think that in previous World Cups like 2006 Trinidad and Tobago did qualify because their team had some success then. But I'm not sure about 2018.  Let me try to remember which teams qualified from CONCACAF for 2018. The top teams usually include the USA Mexico Costa Rica maybe Panama or Honduras. Wait wasn't there a playoff between the fourth-placed team in the CONCACAF qualifiers and another region? I think it was against Australia who were the fifth-place team from Asia.  So if Trinidad and Tobago didn't make it past the qualifiers they wouldn't have been in the World Cup. Alternatively maybe they did qualify through some other means. But I'm pretty sure that in 2018 the CONCACAF teams that qualified were Mexico USA Costa Rica Panama and then there was a playoff between Honduras and another team which I think Honduras won to go to Russia.  Wait no actually the playoff spot went to Panama because they finished fourth in the qualifiers. So the five teams from CONCACAF were Mexico USA Costa Rica Panama and then the fifth spot was determined by a playoff between the fourth-placed team in CONCACAF (which was Trinidad and Tobago) and the fifth-placed team from Asia (Australia). But I think Australia won that playoff so they went to the World Cup instead of Trinidad and Tobago.  So putting it all together Trinidad and Tobago did not qualify for the 2018 World Cup because they lost in the intercontinental playoff. Therefore they were not part of the tournament. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,133.9358998000389,0.04909009895882162,0.014413863827573526,0.0,0.0,0.0
68,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether North and South Korea speak the same language. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about Korean. Both countries are on the Korean Peninsula right? So they share a common history and culture before the division in 1945.  I remember that the official language of both is Korean. But wait maybe there are differences because of the different political systems and influences each country has had since the split. North Korea was influenced by the Soviet Union and China while South Korea was under U.S. influence after the Korean War.  So do they speak exactly the same? I think there might be some differences in vocabulary especially related to technology or modern terms. For example South Korea adopted more Western loanwords whereas North Korea might have created their own terms based on Chinese or Russian influences.  Also pronunciation could vary slightly. Maybe the way certain words are pronounced is different because of regional dialects that developed over time. But I'm not sure if these differences make it so they can't understand each other. Probably not entirely but there might be some nuances.  Another point is education and media. South Korea has a lot of English loanwords in their daily language especially among younger people. North Korea's media and education might use more ideologically charged terms or different expressions due to their political system.  But overall the core language should still be mutually intelligible. People from both sides can generally understand each other even if there are some differences in slang vocabulary and perhaps pronunciation. So while they don't speak exactly the same it's close enough that communication is possible without major issues. </think>  True,True,False,0,0.0,123.51168230001349,0.04527324341509508,0.013293156450247963,0.0,0.0,0.0
69,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether having six wisdom teeth is rare. Hmm let me think about this step by step.  First I know that wisdom teeth are the third molars and they usually come in during a person's late teens or early twenties. Most people have four wisdom teeth—two on the top and two on the bottom. But sometimes people can have more or fewer than four.   I've heard terms like ""supernumerary"" teeth which means extra teeth beyond the usual number. So having six wisdom teeth would mean having two extra ones. I wonder how common that is.  From what I remember supernumerary teeth are not very common. They can occur anywhere in the mouth but they're more often seen in certain areas like the upper front teeth (called mesiodens). Wisdom teeth being supernumerary might be even rarer because wisdom teeth themselves vary a lot in how many people have them.  I think some studies say that having six wisdom teeth is uncommon. It's possible but it's not something everyone experiences. I should check if there are any statistics or medical sources that mention this specifically.  Wait I also recall that the number of wisdom teeth can vary. Some people might have none (which is called being ""anodont"" for wisdom teeth) some have one two three four and occasionally more. So six would definitely be on the higher end.  I think it's safe to say that having six wisdom teeth isn't common. It must be a rare occurrence because most people either have four or fewer. Therefore the answer should be True. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,127.07485800000723,0.04658394639753209,0.01367800583348284,0.0,0.0,0.0

Aslan is a central character a lion who plays a significant role in the stories.  In ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe "" which is the first book there's a crucial scene where Aslan sacrifices himself to save Edmund from the White Witch. The witch kills him but then something happens that brings him back. I think it has to do with an ancient magic or a deeper law in Narnia.  Wait yes after Aslan dies he is resurrected because of the Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time. This means he comes back to life which is a key part of the story and sets up his role as a messianic figure in the series.  So putting it all together Aslan does come back to life after being killed by the White Witch. That's a central plot point in the first book. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,120.20115580002312,0.04405600653948242,0.012935750640459326,0.0,0.0,0.0
72,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's a Grey's Anatomy Season 14. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. Grey's Anatomy has been on for quite some time now. I think it started in the mid-2000s maybe around 2005 or 2006? Each season usually has a certain number of episodes and they've had several seasons so far.  I remember hearing that the show was renewed multiple times but I'm not exactly sure how many seasons there are. Let me think about recent events. In 2021 there were some news articles talking about the show's renewal for more seasons. I believe it was around that time when they announced Season 18 or something like that. Wait no maybe that was a different show.  Wait actually I think Grey's Anatomy has been on for 19 seasons as of now. So if someone is asking about Season 14 that would definitely exist because it's well within the number of seasons they've produced so far. But to be thorough let me check my memory again. The show started in 2005 and each season has been released annually since then. So counting from Season 1 up to now yes Season 14 would have aired around 2018 or 2019.  I don't recall any announcements that they stopped production before reaching Season 14. In fact the show's popularity has kept it going for many years. Therefore it's safe to say that there is a Grey's Anatomy Season 14. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,117.13344190001953,0.04294488140377563,0.012609501422365343,0.0,0.0,0.0
71,"<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether cows need to keep getting pregnant to produce milk. Hmm let me think about this step by step.  First I know that cows like humans are mammals and they produce milk after giving birth. So when a cow has a calf she starts lactating. But does she need to get pregnant again right away to continue producing milk? Or can she keep producing milk without getting pregnant every time?  I remember hearing about dairy farming practices where cows are kept in a cycle of pregnancy and milking. They have a calf produce milk for a certain period then get pregnant again so they can lactate once more. But is that the only way? Or can they just keep producing milk without being pregnant all the time?  Wait maybe it's about how long they lactate after giving birth. I think cows typically lactate for about 10 months or so before their milk production drops off. So to maintain a steady supply of milk farmers might breed them again during that period so that when one cycle ends another begins.  But does the cow have to be pregnant continuously? Or can she take a break between pregnancies? I think in some cases cows are given a dry period where they aren't milked and can rest before getting pregnant again. So maybe it's not that they have to keep getting pregnant without any breaks but rather that periodic pregnancy is necessary to sustain milk production over time.  So putting this together: Cows don't need to be constantly pregnant all the time to produce milk but they do need to get pregnant periodically to continue lactating. Without becoming pregnant again after a certain period their milk production would decrease. Therefore while they don't have to be in a constant state of pregnancy regular pregnancies are necessary for sustained milk production.  Wait but the question is whether cows ""have to keep getting pregnant"" to produce milk. So if they stop getting pregnant will they still produce milk? I think after a certain period without another pregnancy their milk supply would dwindle. Therefore yes they need to get pregnant again periodically to maintain milk production.  So the answer should be True because cows do need to become pregnant again after each lactation cycle to continue producing milk. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,132.83656739999424,0.04869304516300506,0.014297280657718403,0.0,0.0,0.0
73,"<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to have multiple foreign keys in a single table. Let me start by recalling what a foreign key is. From what I remember a foreign key is a column or set of columns in a database table that references the primary key of another table. It's used to maintain referential integrity between tables.  Now the question is whether a table can have more than one foreign key. I think about how databases are structured. For example if I have an ""Orders"" table it might reference a ""Customers"" table via a CustomerID column and also reference a ""Products"" table via a ProductID column. Each of these would be separate foreign keys pointing to different primary keys in other tables.  Wait but can they both exist in the same table? I think yes because each foreign key serves a different purpose. The CustomerID links orders to customers while the ProductID links them to products. So having multiple foreign keys allows for connecting to multiple related entities.  I should also consider if there are any limitations. Maybe some databases have restrictions but generally relational databases support multiple foreign keys in a table as long as each one correctly references another table's primary key.  Another thought: what about composite foreign keys? That is a foreign key made up of more than one column. But the question is about having multiple separate foreign keys not composite ones. So yes each can be independent.  I think I've seen examples where tables have several foreign keys pointing to different parent tables. For instance an ""Employee"" table might reference a ""Department"" table and also a ""Position"" table each with their own foreign key columns.  So putting it all together the answer should be that yes you can have multiple foreign keys in a single table. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,128.97745969999232,0.0472814882546115,0.013882818485223656,0.0,0.0,0.0
74,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether you have to pay to watch the ITV Hub. Let me start by recalling what I know about ITV and their streaming service. ITV is a major UK broadcaster right? They have various channels like ITV1 ITV2 etc. and they also offer an online platform called the ITV Hub.  I think the ITV Hub allows users to stream shows from their channels. But does it require payment? Well I remember that some broadcasters offer free access with ads while others might have a subscription model. For example services like Netflix or Amazon Prime charge a fee but maybe ITV Hub is different.  Wait I've heard that in the UK many TV channels are available for free through terrestrial broadcasts. So perhaps the ITV Hub is also free to use? But then again some content might be behind a paywall especially newer shows or exclusive content.  Let me think about how it works. If you have a Freeview box or a smart TV in the UK you can access ITV without paying anything extra because it's part of the free channels. The ITV Hub is their on-demand service so maybe it's also free as long as you're within the UK and have the right setup.  But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there are premium features or additional content that require a subscription. Or perhaps the availability depends on your location. For instance if you're outside the UK you might need to pay for access through services like ITV Hub+ or something similar.  Wait another angle: some broadcasters offer free tiers with ads and paid tiers without ads or with more content. Does ITV Hub do that? I'm not certain but I think it's primarily free with ads. So if someone is in the UK they can watch for free but maybe there are optional paid add-ons.  I should also consider any recent changes. Maybe ITV has introduced a subscription model recently. But from what I know as of my last update the main ITV Hub service was free to use especially for those with a Freeview license which is required in the UK to watch TV legally.  So putting it all together: The basic access to the ITV Hub is free but there might be premium services or specific content that requires payment. However the question is whether you ""have to"" pay. Since the main service is free the answer would be no you don't have to pay unless you want extra features. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,127.66055839997716,0.04679874066077317,0.013741073851819855,0.0,0.0,0.0

I remember that Call of Duty games often include different modes like campaign multiplayer and sometimes special modes like zombies.  Black Ops 3 was released in 2015 right? I think it's part of the Black Ops series which is known for its intense gameplay and story-driven campaigns. Now about the zombies mode—was that a feature introduced earlier in the series?  I believe that zombies were first introduced in Call of Duty: World at War as a zombie survival mode called ""Zombie Mode."" Then it became a recurring feature in subsequent games including some Black Ops titles. So if I'm not mistaken Black Ops II had a zombies mode too.  Wait but does Black Ops 3 have it? I think the main game might not include zombies as a primary mode because the focus was more on the campaign and multiplayer. However there were DLCs released after the game's launch that added new content. One of those DLCs was called ""Zombie Chronicles "" which introduced a cooperative survival zombie mode.  So in the base game Black Ops 3 doesn't have zombies as a main feature but through DLCs they did add it later on. Therefore the answer would be yes because the zombies were included eventually even if not at launch. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,126.75829279999016,0.0464634845426625,0.013642635752563595,0.0,0.0,0.0

Since Rocky is a movie character not an actual person he wouldn't be inducted into the Hall of Fame. But wait maybe there's some exception because of his impact on pop culture?

77,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the internal intercostal muscles contract during inspiration. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about breathing and the muscles involved.  I remember that breathing involves two main phases: inspiration (inhaling) and expiration (exhaling). During inspiration the diaphragm contracts and moves downward increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity. This decrease in pressure allows air to flow into the lungs. But there are also other muscles involved especially when taking a deep breath.  The intercostal muscles are located between the ribs. There are two types: external and internal. The external intercostals are the ones that lift the rib cage upwards and outwards during inspiration which helps increase the thoracic volume further. They run from the lower border of one rib to the upper border of the next.  Now what about the internal intercostal muscles? I think they're located deeper than the external ones. Their function might be opposite because their name suggests they pull the ribs inward. If that's the case during inspiration when we need more expansion maybe these muscles don't contract but instead relax or even help in some way.  Wait no actually during normal quiet breathing expiration is mostly passive relying on the elastic recoil of the lungs and the diaphragm moving upward as it relaxes. But during forced expiration like when coughing or blowing out the internal intercostals do contract to pull the rib cage downward and inward which helps expel more air.  So for inspiration especially deep breathing the external intercostals are active pulling the ribs up and outward. The internal ones probably don't contract during this phase because their role is more in expiration or forced exhalation. Instead they might relax to allow the rib cage to expand.  I think I've heard that during normal inspiration only the diaphragm and external intercostals are active. The internal intercostals come into play when you need a stronger push outwards like when coughing or exhaling forcefully. So in regular breathing they don't contract during inspiration. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,118.95505120002781,0.04358227976025728,0.012796654703966024,0.0,0.0,0.0
78,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether log x is the same as ln x. Hmm let me start by recalling what each of these stands for.   I remember that ""log"" can sometimes be a bit ambiguous because it depends on the context. In mathematics and higher-level science especially in calculus or advanced algebra when someone writes ""log x "" they usually mean the natural logarithm which is denoted as ln x. But wait isn't that only sometimes? I think in some contexts like engineering or basic math classes ""log"" might refer to base 10 logarithms instead.  So if we're talking about log base e then yes it would be the same as ln x because both are natural logarithms. But if ""log"" is referring to a different base like base 10 then they aren't the same. The question doesn't specify the base for log x so I have to consider that ambiguity.  In many scientific and mathematical contexts especially in calculus when people say ""log "" they often mean natural logarithm without specifying the base because e is a fundamental constant. However in other fields or educational settings it might default to base 10.   So unless specified otherwise log x could be either ln x (base e) or log base 10. Since the question doesn't provide any additional context I can't assume they're referring to the same thing. Therefore in general without knowing the base of ""log "" it's not safe to say that log x is the same as ln x.  Wait but sometimes people do use log and ln interchangeably when talking about natural logs. So maybe in some cases they are the same. But I think the safer answer is that they aren't necessarily the same because of the potential ambiguity in the base of ""log.""   I should also consider if there's a standard definition where log always means natural logarithm. In higher mathematics yes but not universally. So without more context it's better to say they're not the same. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,108.46623500002897,0.03971939884832941,0.011662433330866596,0.0,0.0,0.0
79,<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether runs in Gin Rummy need to be of the same suit. Let me start by recalling what a run is in Gin Rummy. From what I remember a run consists of three or more consecutive cards. But wait does that mean they have to all be from the same suit? Hmm.  I think in some card games like Poker runs can be across suits because it's about the sequence of numbers regardless of the suit. But Gin Rummy might have different rules. Let me try to remember how Gin Rummy works. In Gin Rummy you're trying to form melds which are either sets or runs.  A set is three or four cards of the same rank but different suits. So that's clear—sets require same rank different suits. Now a run is three or more consecutive ranks and I believe they can be in any suit as long as each card is from a different suit. Wait no maybe not necessarily different suits just that they don't have to all be the same suit.  Wait actually I think runs in Gin Rummy do require all cards to be of the same suit. Because if you could mix suits it would make forming runs easier but I'm pretty sure the rules specify that a run must consist of consecutive ranks and all from the same suit. So for example 5♠ 6♠ 7♠ is a valid run but 5♠ 6♥ 7♦ wouldn't be because they're different suits.  But wait maybe I'm confusing it with another game. Let me think again. In some variations of Rummy runs can be mixed suits as long as the ranks are consecutive. But in Gin Rummy specifically I believe the standard rule is that all cards in a run must be from the same suit. That makes sense because it adds a layer of difficulty and strategy.  So putting it together: Runs in Gin Rummy require three or more consecutive cards and they must all be of the same suit. Therefore the answer should be True. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,118.8367825000023,0.043519266671908155,0.0127781527637768,0.0,0.0,0.0
81,"<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether I need a visa to visit Oman. Let me start by recalling what I know about visas and travel requirements. Visas are typically required for entry into most countries unless there's an agreement in place that allows citizens of certain nations to enter without one.  I remember that some Middle Eastern countries have different policies especially for tourists. Maybe Oman has a visa-on-arrival option or perhaps they allow stays up to a certain number of days without a prior visa. I think some countries offer e-visas now which you can apply for online before traveling.  Let me break this down. First who is asking? The user didn't specify their nationality so I should consider the general case. If someone is from a country that has a visa waiver agreement with Oman they might not need a traditional visa. Alternatively some nationalities might require an e-visa or a tourist visa upon arrival.  I think Oman does offer visas on arrival for tourists. For example citizens of many European countries the US Canada Australia and others can get a visa when they arrive at the airport. This usually involves paying a fee and providing necessary documents like a passport with enough validity. The duration might be around 30 days or so.  However I'm not entirely sure about all nationalities. Some countries might require applying for a visa in advance. So it's possible that depending on where you're from you either need a visa beforehand or can get one upon arrival.  Wait but the question is general: ""do you need a visa to visit Oman."" Without specifying nationality I should consider whether it's generally required or not. Since many tourists can obtain a visa on arrival maybe the answer is that you don't necessarily need a prior visa but you might need one upon entry.  Alternatively if someone is from a country that doesn't have such an agreement they would definitely need a visa beforehand. So it's conditional based on nationality.  But the question is phrased as a general statement: ""do you need a visa to visit Oman."" The answer could be yes or no depending on circumstances. However since many people can get a visa upon arrival perhaps the answer leans towards 'False' because not everyone needs a prior visa; they can obtain it when they arrive.  Wait but technically even if you get it on arrival it's still a visa. So maybe the correct answer is that you do need a visa but it can be obtained at the point of entry rather than beforehand.  Hmm this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The question is whether you ""need"" a visa to visit Oman. If you can enter without a prior visa by getting one upon arrival then in a sense you don't need a visa before traveling because it's available at the destination. So perhaps the answer is 'False' because you don't necessarily need a visa beforehand; you can get it when you arrive.  But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe some nationalities require an advance visa regardless. Since the question doesn't specify I should consider the general case where many tourists can obtain a visa on arrival making the answer that you don't ""need"" one in advance. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,118.22127340000588,0.043316440364707956,0.012718598783755584,0.0,0.0,0.0
80,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether a cougar and a mountain lion are the same thing. Hmm I've heard both terms before but I'm not entirely sure if they refer to the same animal or different ones. Let me think about this step by step.  First I remember that cougars are big cats found in North America. They're also sometimes called pumas or panthers. Mountain lions on the other hand sound like a similar type of cat but maybe with a different name. Wait could it be that they're just regional names for the same animal?  I think about where each term is used. I've heard ""mountain lion"" more commonly in places like the Rockies or western United States. Meanwhile ""cougar"" might be used more in other regions or perhaps internationally. Maybe it's a matter of terminology depending on the area.  Also considering their scientific classification if they're the same species they would share the same genus and species name. I believe both cougars and mountain lions are Felis concolor which suggests they're indeed the same animal. So different names but one species.  I don't recall any significant differences in physical characteristics between cougars and mountain lions that would suggest they're separate species. They look similar—large tawny coats long tails. Behaviorally I think they have the same habits too like being solitary hunters.  Wait could there be subspecies? Maybe some regional variations but that doesn't make them different animals entirely. Subspecies are still part of the same broader species. So even if there are slight differences they're not separate species.  I also remember hearing that ""cougar"" is a term more commonly used in Canada and parts of the United States while ""mountain lion"" is another common name for the same creature. There's also ""puma "" which I think is another name for them as well. So it seems like they're all referring to Felis concolor.  To sum up after considering their names regions where each term is used and their scientific classification it makes sense that cougar and mountain lion are the same animal with different common names. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,122.54678410000633,0.044902676663570076,0.013184350421969467,0.0,0.0,0.0
82,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Comcast and Time Warner are the same company. Let me start by recalling what I know about both companies.  Comcast is a well-known name in the United States for providing cable television internet and phone services. They're one of the big players in the telecom industry. I remember hearing that they've been involved in some major mergers before like with NBCUniversal.   Time Warner on the other hand is another large media company. They own networks like HBO CNN and TBS. Time Warner also used to be a provider of cable services but I think they restructured or sold those parts at some point.  Wait wasn't there a merger between Time Warner and Comcast? Or was it with another company? Let me think. Oh right Time Warner merged with AT&T in 2018 to form WarnerMedia which later became part of Discovery Inc. after AT&T spun off the assets. So Time Warner isn't an independent entity anymore; it's now under Discovery.  Comcast though is still a separate company. They have their own set of services and subsidiaries like Xfinity for internet and TV. So even if they were competitors or had some partnerships in the past they aren't the same company now.  I should also consider any possible confusion between Comcast and Time Warner Cable (TWC). TWC was another major cable provider that merged with Charter Communications to form Spectrum. But again that's separate from both Comcast and the current Time Warner/Discovery entity.  So putting it all together: Comcast is a telecom and media company while Time Warner has been absorbed into AT&T and then Discovery. They are not the same company. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,118.17110869998578,0.04329593665757424,0.0127125784731664,0.0,0.0,0.0
83,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's peanut butter in Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Let me start by recalling what I know about these candies. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are a popular chocolate treat that has two layers. The bottom layer is usually milk chocolate and the top layer is something else. From what I remember the top part is supposed to be peanut butter.   Wait but sometimes companies change their recipes or use substitutes. Maybe they don't actually have real peanut butter? Or perhaps it's a different kind of filling. Let me think about the ingredients listed on the package. I believe Reese's uses peanut butter as one of the main components in the top layer. It's supposed to be creamy and spreadable which makes sense for peanut butter.  I also remember hearing that Reese's is known for its combination of chocolate and peanut butter. That's a classic pairing so it makes sense they'd use actual peanut butter. But I should double-check if there are any alternative versions or if the original product has changed over time. Maybe some limited editions have different fillings but the standard ones should still have peanut butter.  Another angle: sometimes companies might use alternatives like nougat or other nut-based spreads instead of peanut butter for various reasons such as allergies or taste variations. But in this case Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are specifically named after peanut butter so it's likely they include it as a key ingredient.  I think I've seen the ingredients listed before and peanut butter was definitely one of them. So putting it all together yes there should be peanut butter in Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,119.32284459998482,0.043714811430326905,0.012835568731147492,0.0,0.0,0.0
84,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Falkland Islands are part of the Commonwealth. Let me start by recalling what the Commonwealth is. From what I remember it's a political association of member states that were once territories of the British Empire. The Commonwealth doesn't have a centralized government but promotes cooperation among its members.  Now the Falkland Islands—where are they? They're located in the South Atlantic Ocean right? I think they're a British Overseas Territory because I remember hearing about the Falklands War between the UK and Argentina over their control. So if they're a British Overseas Territory does that automatically make them part of the Commonwealth?  Wait not necessarily. The Commonwealth includes countries that are independent but have historical ties to Britain like Canada or Australia. But territories even though they belong to the UK might not be members themselves. For example Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory and I don't think it's a member of the Commonwealth.  So do the Falkland Islands have their own representation in the Commonwealth? Or are they just under the UK's jurisdiction within the Commonwealth? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should check if the Falklands have ever applied for membership or if they're considered part of the UK's delegation.  I think the key point is that while the Falkland Islands are a British Overseas Territory they aren't an independent country. The Commonwealth typically comprises sovereign states so unless the Falklands gained independence and joined they wouldn't be members. Since they remain under the UK's administration their status in the Commonwealth would likely be tied to the UK rather than being separate members.  Therefore I don't believe the Falkland Islands are part of the Commonwealth as distinct entities. They're more like part of the UK's territory within the Commonwealth framework but not members on their own. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,119.84053689998109,0.0439044377859532,0.012891246933597424,0.0,0.0,0.0
85,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether a Quarter Pounder weighs a quarter of a pound. Hmm the name suggests that it's a quarter pound burger but I remember hearing somewhere that sometimes food items don't exactly match their names in terms of weight. Let me think about this.  First what is a Quarter Pounder? It's a popular burger from McDonald's right? So if it's called a Quarter Pounder one might assume the patty weighs a quarter pound. But wait I've heard that sometimes the actual weight can be different because of how they prepare or cook the meat.  I think when you order a burger like this the raw patty is a certain size but after cooking it loses some weight due to shrinkage and moisture loss. So maybe the Quarter Pounder refers to the cooked weight? Or does it refer to the raw weight before cooking?  Let me check my memory. I believe that McDonald's specifies the weight of their burgers as the cooked weight. So if they say a Quarter Pounder that means after cooking the patty is about 4 ounces which is a quarter pound. But wait isn't there also something about the bun and other toppings? No the burger itself refers to just the meat patty.  Wait but I've heard some people say that the actual weight might be slightly less than a quarter pound because of how it's prepared or maybe even more. Or perhaps they include the sauce and lettuce in the weight? That doesn't make sense because usually the burger patty is separate from the toppings.  Another angle: sometimes companies use terms like ""quarter pound"" as a marketing term rather than an exact measurement. So maybe it's close to a quarter pound but not exactly. But I think McDonald's does specify that their Quarter Pounder has a 4-ounce beef patty which is a quarter pound. However I'm not entirely sure if that includes any added ingredients or if it's just the meat.  Wait no the Quarter Pounder specifically refers to the meat patty. So if it's cooked and weighs 4 ounces then yes it's a quarter pound. But sometimes people might confuse the total weight of the burger with the patty alone. For example the entire burger (patty plus bun lettuce tomato etc.) would weigh more than a quarter pound.  So putting it all together: The name ""Quarter Pounder"" refers to the weight of the beef patty after cooking which is 4 ounces or a quarter pound. Therefore yes the Quarter Pounder does weigh a quarter pound in terms of its meat content. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,128.8962584999972,0.04723751630965233,0.013869907416794018,0.0,0.0,0.0
86,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Murphy Brown had a baby on the show. Let me start by recalling what I know about the TV series ""Murphy Brown."" It's a sitcom that aired from 1987 to 1998 starring Candice Bergen as the titular character. Murphy is a news anchor who works at a fictional TV station.  I remember that Murphy had some significant life events throughout the series. She got married and divorced and I think she also went through some career challenges. But did she have a baby? Hmm I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to break it down.  First I'll consider her relationships. She was married to Richard played by Grant Tinker but they didn't have children together as far as I can remember. Then there's the character of Paul who was her on-air partner and later became a significant other. They had some storylines that might involve kids.  Wait wasn't there an episode where Murphy adopted a child? Or maybe she had a biological child? I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think about specific episodes or seasons. In one of the later seasons I believe she did have a baby. The character's storyline evolved over time and having a child would make sense as part of her personal growth.  I also recall that the show tackled various social issues and personal milestones so it's plausible they included a pregnancy and childbirth for Murphy. It might have been in the later seasons when the show was winding down. I think Candice Bergen's character did give birth on the show which would mean Murphy Brown had a baby.  But wait could there be confusion with another character? Maybe her co-workers or friends had babies instead. For example Corky Romano played by Faith Ford might have had children but that's not Murphy. I'm pretty sure it was Murphy who went through the pregnancy and gave birth on the show.  So putting it all together yes Murphy Brown did have a baby on the series. The storyline included her pregnancy delivery and raising the child as a single mother. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,124.15403900001547,0.04547578513335625,0.013352626869096947,0.0,0.0,0.0
87,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the US has ever won the World Cup in soccer. Let me start by recalling what the World Cup is. It's a major international football tournament held every four years organized by FIFA. The first one was in 1930 right?   Now thinking about which countries have won it. I know Brazil has won it multiple times five or six maybe. Germany and Italy also have several titles each. Then there are others like Argentina England France Spain Uruguay... Wait did the US ever make it to the finals?  I remember hearing that the US men's team qualified for a few World Cups especially in recent decades. They might have had some notable performances. But winning? I'm not sure. Let me think about specific years.   In 1994 the World Cup was held in the United States. That must have been a big deal for them. Did they win it then? No I don't think so. Brazil won that one with Romário and all. Then in 2002 Brazil won again. In 2010 Spain won their first title. The US team was there but didn't make it far.  Wait maybe the women's team has won? Oh right! The US women's national soccer team is super successful. They've won multiple World Cups and Olympics. But the question is about the men's team I think since it just says ""world cup soccer.""   So putting it all together: the US men's team hasn't won a World Cup yet. Their best performance was maybe third place in 1930? Or was that another country? No wait the US did finish third in 1930 but that doesn't count as winning the cup because the final was only between two teams back then. So they didn't win it outright.

89,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""fitness"" as used in biology and ""survival"" mean the same thing. Let me start by recalling what each term means.  In biology fitness refers to an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its environment. It's not just about living a long time but also about passing on genes successfully. So it includes both survival and reproductive success.  Survival on the other hand is more straightforward—it's about whether an organism lives or dies. Survival doesn't necessarily account for reproduction; you can survive without reproducing which means you're contributing less to your gene pool.  So while fitness does involve survival as a component it goes beyond that by including reproductive success. Therefore they don't have the exact same meaning because fitness encompasses more than just surviving. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,119.6567076999927,0.04384962858411095,0.012875153823405998,0.0,0.0,0.0
88,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if Illinois has a ""stand your ground"" law. I'm not too familiar with the specifics of each state's laws but I know that some states have these kinds of self-defense statutes. Let me think about what I remember.  First I recall that ""stand your ground"" generally means that a person doesn't have to retreat if they feel threatened and can use force in self-defense without needing to back away first. This is different from the ""duty to retreat"" which some states require before using deadly force.  I think Illinois has something related to self-defense but I'm not sure if it's exactly ""stand your ground."" Maybe it's more about justifiable homicide or defense of person and property. Let me try to remember any specific laws or cases from Illinois.  Wait I believe that in Illinois the law does allow for self-defense without retreating if you're in a place where you have a right to be. So maybe they don't require retreat in their self-defense statute. That might mean it's similar to ""stand your ground "" but perhaps not explicitly called that.  I should also consider whether there are any specific statutes or court decisions that clarify this. I think Illinois has a law that says if someone is attacked and believes they're in imminent danger they can use reasonable force without retreating. That sounds like it aligns with ""stand your ground"" principles but might not be labeled as such.  Alternatively maybe Illinois doesn't have the same kind of ""stand your ground"" laws as Florida or Texas which are more well-known for them. Instead Illinois might follow a different approach where retreat isn't required in certain circumstances like when you're in your own home or if retreating would be unsafe.  I'm also trying to remember if there was any recent legislation or changes. I don't think so; the laws have been relatively stable on this front. So putting it all together Illinois does allow for self-defense without retreat under certain conditions which is akin to ""stand your ground "" but perhaps not explicitly named as such in their statutes.  Wait no actually upon further reflection I might be mixing up some details. Some sources say that Illinois doesn't have a formal ""stand your ground"" law and instead follows the traditional approach where retreat is required unless you're in your own home or face an imminent threat of death or serious harm. So maybe my initial thought was incorrect.  I think I need to clarify this. Let me break it down: In some states like Florida ""stand your ground"" means no duty to retreat anywhere even public places. Illinois might require retreat unless in certain situations such as being in one's home or facing an unavoidable threat.  So perhaps the answer is that Illinois does not have a stand your ground law but has exceptions where retreat isn't required. Therefore the answer would be False because they don't have a formal ""stand your ground"" statute but have similar protections under specific circumstances. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,132.96560350002255,0.048713893153678564,0.014303402057043727,0.0,0.0,0.0
90,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Britain has the right to bear arms. Hmm let me start by recalling what I know about this topic. In the United States there's a Second Amendment that guarantees the right to bear arms but I'm not sure how it works in other countries like the UK.  I think Britain has different laws regarding firearms. From what I remember the UK has stricter gun control laws compared to the US. Maybe they don't have an explicit right to bear arms enshrined in their constitution or bill of rights. But wait does that mean there's no right at all? Or is it more about regulation?  I should consider the legal framework. The UK doesn't have a written constitution like the US; instead it has various statutes and common law. So perhaps the right to bear arms isn't explicitly stated but might be regulated through other means.  There are laws in the UK that control firearms ownership. For example you need a license to own a gun and certain types of firearms are banned. This suggests that while there's no absolute prohibition on owning guns it's heavily regulated. So does this mean there's an implicit right but with significant restrictions?  I also recall something about self-defense in the UK. People can use reasonable force for self-defense but I'm not sure how that ties into bearing arms. Maybe the right to bear arms isn't as broad or recognized in the same way as in the US.  Additionally historical context might play a role. The UK has had different experiences with firearms compared to the US which might influence their laws and attitudes towards gun ownership. There have been instances where gun control was tightened after certain incidents like the Dunblane massacre.  So putting it all together: Britain doesn't have an explicit right to bear arms as in the US. Instead firearm possession is tightly regulated with licensing requirements. Therefore while individuals can own firearms under specific conditions there isn't a constitutional right that guarantees this freedom. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,132.9400104000233,0.04871656496595472,0.014304186556141064,0.0,0.0,0.0
91,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Civil Rights Act is part of the Constitution. Hmm let me think about this step by step.  First what do I know about the U.S. Constitution? It's the supreme law of the land outlining the structure of government and the fundamental rights of citizens. The original document was written in 1787 and has been amended over time with the Bill of Rights and other amendments.  Now the Civil Rights Act—I remember that there have been several Civil Rights Acts passed by Congress. For example the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a significant piece of legislation that addressed issues like discrimination in public places employment and education. But wait isn't that an act passed by Congress rather than being part of the Constitution itself?  The Constitution includes amendments related to civil rights such as the 13th Amendment which abolished slavery the 14th Amendment which addresses citizenship and equal protection under the law and the 15th Amendment about voting rights. These are all part of the Constitution.  However the Civil Rights Act is a statute enacted by Congress not an amendment to the Constitution. So while it's related to civil rights it's not part of the Constitution itself but rather federal legislation that implements and enforces constitutional principles.  Therefore the answer should be False because the Civil Rights Act isn't in the Constitution; it's a separate law passed by Congress. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,124.51620069998899,0.045619024214109086,0.013394684812522362,0.0,0.0,0.0
92,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if thread seal tape and Teflon tape are the same thing. Let me start by recalling what each of these tapes is used for.  Thread seal tape also known as PTFE tape or plumber's tape is commonly used in plumbing to create a watertight seal on pipe threads. It helps prevent leaks by filling the gaps between the threads and providing a smooth surface for the joint.  Teflon tape is another name for PTFE tape because Teflon is the brand name of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). So thread seal tape is made from Teflon material. That makes me think they are the same product but referred to by different names depending on the context or brand.  I should also consider if there's any difference in their application or properties. Both tapes have similar uses and consistencies; they're both thin stretchy and slippery. They’re applied in the same way—wrapped around pipe threads before connecting them.  Wait could there be a situation where they aren't exactly the same? Maybe some specialized tapes might have additives for specific purposes but generally thread seal tape is Teflon/PTFE tape. So yes they are the same. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,126.65786710000248,0.04640164001765084,0.013624476926631166,0.0,0.0,0.0
93,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Hawaii was once known as the Sandwich Islands. Hmm I remember hearing something about that from history class or maybe a documentary. Let me think... The name ""Sandwich Islands"" sounds familiar in relation to Hawaii. I think it has something to do with Captain James Cook right? He was an explorer and I believe he named some islands after the Earl of Sandwich.  Wait why would he name them that? Oh because the Earl of Sandwich was a sponsor or maybe someone important who supported his voyages. So when Cook arrived in Hawaii which was then called Oceania by the natives he named the archipelago the Sandwich Islands in honor of the Earl. That makes sense.  But I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate. Maybe it's just a myth? Let me try to recall more details. Captain Cook did explore the Hawaiian islands in the late 18th century around 1778. At that time the islands were under the rule of King Kamehameha I. So Cook would have been one of the first Europeans to make contact there.  I think the name ""Sandwich Islands"" was used by Europeans and Americans for some time after Cook's discovery. It wasn't until later that the name Hawaii became more commonly used especially as the islands became more integrated into global trade and politics. The Sandwich Islands were part of the British Empire's influence in the Pacific but eventually the local rulers and then the United States took over.  So putting it all together: yes Hawaii was indeed called the Sandwich Islands by Europeans after Captain Cook named them that way. That seems correct based on what I remember from history. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,123.82672209999873,0.04535419173974502,0.013316924545104589,0.0,0.0,0.0

I remember that there's a book called ""The Tale of Despereaux"" written by Kate DiCamillo. It's a children's novel and it won some awards maybe the Newbery Medal? Yeah I think that's right.  Now did Disney make a movie based on this book? I'm not entirely sure. I know Disney has adapted several books into movies like ""The Lion King"" from ""The Jungle Book "" but I don't recall ""Despereaux"" being one of them. Wait maybe it was another studio? Or perhaps it's an animated film?  I think there was a movie adaptation of ""The Tale of Despereaux."" Let me try to remember the details. The main character is a mouse named Despereaux Tilling right? He has big ears and goes on some kind of adventure. I believe the movie came out around 2008 or so.  Wait was it Disney or another company? I'm mixing up some animated films from that time. There's ""Bolt "" which is a Disney movie but that's about a dog. Then there's ""The Tale of Despereaux."" Hmm maybe it's produced by DreamWorks instead? Or perhaps it's an independent film.  I think the movie was actually made by Walden Media and distributed by 20th Century Fox. That would mean it's not a Disney production. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to recall any actors or voices in the movie. I believe Matthew Broderick voiced Despereaux and maybe someone like Sigourney Weaver was involved as well.  Wait if it's distributed by 20th Century Fox that would make it a Fox movie not Disney. So putting this together: The book is by Kate DiCamillo the movie adaptation was produced by Walden Media and released by Fox so it's not a Disney movie.

95,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether a batter gets an RBI on a fielder's choice. Hmm let me start by recalling what an RBI is. RBI stands for Runs Batted In which means it's when a batter helps another runner score by hitting the ball or getting hit by it leading to a run being scored.  Now a fielder's choice is a play where the fielder chooses to make an out on a different runner instead of trying to get the batter out. For example if there are runners on base and the batter hits the ball the fielder might decide to tag out a runner who's closer to scoring rather than try to catch the batter.  So in this scenario does the batter still get credit for an RBI? I think it depends on whether a run scores as a result of their action. If the fielder's choice leads to a runner being forced out but another runner scores because of the play then maybe the batter gets the RBI. But if no runs score they don't.  Wait let me think again. The key is whether the batter's action directly causes a run to score. In a fielder's choice sometimes the play results in an out and a runner being forced out but another runner might advance into scoring position or actually score because of it. So if that happens the batter would get the RBI.  But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there are specific rules about this. Let me try to remember any specific cases. For example if there's a runner on third and the batter hits a ground ball that results in a fielder's choice where the runner is forced out at home but another runner scores because of the play does the batter get the RBI? I think yes because their hit allowed the run to score.  Alternatively if the fielder's choice doesn't result in any runs scoring then no RBI. So it's conditional based on whether a run actually comes in as a result of the play.  Wait but sometimes even if a runner is forced out at home another runner might have advanced and scored because the fielder had to make that choice. So in that case the batter would get the RBI for the run that was scored.  I think I'm getting somewhere. The key factor is whether a run scores as a result of the batter's action regardless of whether they're out or not. So if a fielder's choice leads to a runner scoring then yes the batter gets an RBI. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,130.9264938000124,0.04797605223543498,0.014086756771180767,0.0,0.0,0.0
96,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the County Court Business Centre is a real court or not. Let me start by breaking down what each part means.  First ""County Court"" – that sounds like it's related to local government or legal system structures. In many places county courts handle various cases maybe civil matters or lower-level criminal cases. So the term ""County Court"" suggests an official judicial body.  Next ""Business Centre."" That usually refers to a place where businesses operate perhaps providing services or facilitating transactions. It could be a physical location with offices or support services for companies.  Putting them together: County Court Business Centre. This might imply that it's a facility associated with the county court system but focused on business-related activities. Maybe it handles filings administrative tasks or provides resources specifically for businesses interacting with the court.  I should consider whether such centers are common. In some jurisdictions courts have separate facilities for different functions. For example there could be a family court center a criminal court center and perhaps a business court center. These would still be part of the official court system but specialized in certain areas.  Alternatively it might not be an actual courtroom where trials take place but rather an administrative office that supports court operations related to businesses. This doesn't necessarily make it a ""court"" itself but a support center for courts dealing with business matters.  I should also think about whether there are real examples of such centers. Maybe in some counties they have dedicated spaces for handling business litigation or disputes which would be part of the county court system. In that case while it's not a courtroom per se it's an integral part of the judicial process.  However if ""County Court Business Centre"" refers to a private facility unrelated to the government courts then it wouldn't be a real court. But given the phrasing with ""County Court "" it seems more likely connected to official structures.  So considering all this I think the County Court Business Centre is part of the real court system even if its primary function is administrative or specialized support rather than conducting trials. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,134.10225130000617,0.04913153905784889,0.014426031493906432,0.0,0.0,0.0
97,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the US still made $2 bills in 2018. Let me start by recalling what I know about US currency. The dollar bills we commonly use are $1 $5 $10 $20 and so on. I remember hearing that $2 bills exist but aren't as common.   I think the $2 bill is still in circulation because I've seen one before though it's rare. But does the government continue to produce them? Maybe they don't print them regularly like other denominations. I should check when was the last time the $2 bill was printed.  Wait I believe the $2 bill was redesigned a few years back. If I'm not mistaken the redesign happened around 2017 or 2018. So if they redid it in 2018 that would mean they were still making them then. But maybe production stopped after that? Or perhaps they only print them on demand.  I should also consider why $2 bills aren't as common. It might be because people don't use them much so the demand is low. The government probably doesn't print a lot of them unless there's a specific need. So even if they were made in 2018 it might have been a limited run.  Another angle: sometimes countries stop producing certain denominations due to lack of use or other reasons. But I don't recall any news about discontinuing the $2 bill. In fact I think it's still legal tender and can be obtained from banks if requested.  So putting this together even though they aren't printed in large quantities the $2 bills were still being made in 2018 as part of a redesign effort. Therefore the answer should be true. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,129.28321910000523,0.04737017296349553,0.013908858141784842,0.0,0.0,0.0
98,<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether quantum entanglement can transfer information faster than the speed of light. Hmm I remember from my basic physics classes that quantum entanglement is this phenomenon where particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one instantly influences the state of another no matter the distance between them. But wait isn't there something about how this doesn't actually allow for faster-than-light communication?  Let me think. When two particles are entangled if you measure one the other's state is determined immediately. That seems like it could be instantaneous which would imply a speed faster than light. But I've also heard that you can't use this to send information because the outcomes are random. So even though the states are connected you can't control what the outcome will be when you measure them.  So if Alice and Bob have entangled particles and Alice measures hers Bob's particle instantly reflects that change. But without some classical communication Bob doesn't know what Alice did or what the result was. He just sees a random state. So he can't actually get any information from it because there's no way to encode a message in the randomness.  Also I think Einstein talked about this with his EPR paradox suggesting that maybe quantum mechanics is incomplete. But experiments like Bell's theorem have shown that local hidden variable theories don't hold supporting the idea of non-locality but not allowing for information transfer faster than light.  So putting it all together: entanglement creates correlations between particles but you can't use those correlations to send actual information because the results are random and require classical communication to interpret. Therefore even though the effect is instantaneous it doesn't enable faster-than-light information transfer. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,131.86956609998015,0.04831522032329654,0.014186343505303994,0.0,0.0,0.0
99,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""World at War"" is part of ""Black Ops."" Let me start by recalling what each of these terms refers to.  First ""World at War"" sounds like it could be a video game. I remember there's a Call of Duty game called ""Call of Duty: World at War "" which was released in 2008. It's part of the main Call of Duty series and focuses on World War II battles from different perspectives including the Soviet Union United States and others.  On the other hand ""Black Ops"" is another series within the Call of Duty franchise. The first game in that series was ""Call of Duty: Black Ops "" released in 2010. It's known for its Cold War setting and a mix of historical and fictional elements. There are also sequels like ""Black Ops II"" and ""Black Ops III.""  So the question is whether ""World at War"" is part of the ""Black Ops"" series. From what I know each Call of Duty game typically falls under either the main series or one of its sub-series like Black Ops or Modern Warfare. Since ""World at War"" was released before the first ""Black Ops "" it's part of the main series not the Black Ops sub-series.  I don't think there's any overlap between these two in terms of being part of each other's series. They're both Call of Duty games but under different branches. Therefore ""World at War"" isn't part of ""Black Ops."" </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,125.60309140002937,0.04602205954870353,0.013513024285323548,0.0,0.0,0.0
100,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if tonic water and quinine water are the same thing. Let me start by recalling what each of these is.  Tonic water is something I've heard about before. It's often used in cocktails like with gin. From what I remember it has a bitter taste because of quinine. Quinine is a substance that comes from the bark of the cinchona tree right? So tonic water contains quinine as one of its main ingredients.  Now quinine water—does that refer to the same thing? Well if tonic water is made with quinine then maybe they are the same. But I should double-check. Maybe there's a difference in concentration or other additives. Tonic water might have added sugar and flavors besides just quinine making it more of a drinkable product rather than pure quinine solution.  Wait but sometimes people use ""quinine water"" interchangeably with tonic water because the key active ingredient is quinine. So perhaps they are referring to the same beverage just different names based on what's emphasized—either the effect (tonic) or the main component (quinine).  I don't think there's a separate product called quinine water that's distinct from tonic water. It seems like both terms describe a carbonated drink containing quinine used for its flavor and as an ingredient in mixed drinks.  So putting it all together I believe they are the same thing. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,119.99398690002272,0.04395169501142518,0.01290512262803009,0.0,0.0,0.0
101,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's such a thing as Corinthian leather. Hmm I've heard the term before maybe from car interiors or something like that. Let me think about where I might have come across it.  I remember seeing cars with really nice-looking seats and sometimes they mention the type of leather used. Corinthian leather sounds fancy so maybe it's a high-quality material. But wait is it actually a real thing? Or could it be just a marketing term?  Let me break this down. Leather comes from animals usually cows right? There are different grades based on quality and how it's processed. I think the grain of the leather matters—some have a smooth finish others might be more textured.  Corinthian... that name makes me think of something specific maybe from a particular region or with a certain process. But I'm not sure if it's an actual type of leather or just a brand name used by manufacturers to sound upscale.  I should consider the sources. Maybe looking up some car upholstery materials would help. If Corinthian leather is real there should be information about its characteristics where it's sourced from and how it's processed. Alternatively if it's not a recognized type of leather then it might just be a term used for marketing purposes.  Wait I think I've heard that some car brands use the term ""Corinthian"" to describe their premium leather options but I'm not sure if it's an industry-standard term or just their own branding. It could also be that they're referring to a specific treatment or finish applied to the leather making it feel and look a certain way.  Another angle: maybe Corinthian refers to something else entirely like a fabric or another material altogether. But given the context of car interiors it's more likely related to leather.  I should check if there are any official classifications for leather types that include Corinthian. From what I know common types include full-grain top-grain aniline and semi-aniline leathers. I don't recall hearing about Corinthian in those categories.  So putting it all together: If Corinthian leather isn't a recognized type within the leather industry but is used by certain manufacturers to denote their high-end products then technically it might not be a real thing beyond being a marketing term. However if it's an actual grade or process then yes it exists.  But I think in reality it's more of a brand-specific term rather than an industry standard. So the answer would probably be False because there isn't an official type called Corinthian leather; it's just used by some companies to describe their premium offerings. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,128.87177739999606,0.04721611778501621,0.01386362436936169,0.0,0.0,0.0
102,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if any of the original members of Lynyrd Skynyrd are still alive. Let me start by recalling what I know about the band. Lynyrd Skynyrd is a Southern rock band that became famous in the 70s with hits like ""Free Bird"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama."" They were part of the Southern rock movement along with bands like The Allman Brothers and ZZ Top.  I remember hearing about a plane crash involving the band. I think it was in 1977 right? That crash was pretty tragic because several members died. Let me try to list out the original members. The main lineup included Ronnie Van Zant as the lead vocalist Steve Gaines on guitar and vocals and Scott Roberts on keyboards. Then there were the rhythm section: Larry Junstrom on drums Bob Burns on bass and Gary Rossington on guitar. Also I think Ed King was an original guitarist who left before the crash.  So after the plane crash in 1977 Ronnie Van Zant Steve Gaines and Cassie Gaines (who was the backup singer) died. That leaves Scott Roberts Larry Junstrom Bob Burns Gary Rossington and Ed King as possible survivors. Wait but I think some of them might have passed away since then.  Let me check each one:  1. Ronnie Van Zant: Died in 1977. 2. Steve Gaines: Died in 1977. 3. Cassie Gaines: Died in 1977. 4. Ed King: He left the band before the crash and was not on the plane. I believe he's still alive but let me confirm. Yes Ed King is alive as of recent years; he's been active with other bands like The Southern Rock All-Stars. 5. Gary Rossington: He survived the crash and continued with Lynyrd Skynyrd after that. I think he's still alive too. 6. Larry Junstrom: He was on the plane but survived. However I'm not sure about his current status. Wait no actually Larry Junstrom died in 2014 from cancer. 7. Bob Burns: He was also on the plane and survived. But did he pass away later? Yes Bob Burns died in 2018.  So among the original members who were part of the band before the crash Ed King is alive as well as Gary Rossington. Wait but I thought Gary Rossington was on the plane. Let me clarify: yes Gary Rossington survived the crash and continued with the band. He's still active and has been touring with Lynyrd Skynyrd.  Wait so that means at least two original members are alive: Ed King and Gary Rossington. But I should double-check if there were any other original members who might still be alive. Scott Roberts was on keyboards but left the band before the crash. He died in 2014 as well.  So to sum up among the original lineup Ed King and Gary Rossington survived the plane crash and are still alive today. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,129.6895931000181,0.04750475003643967,0.01394837274136545,0.0,0.0,0.0
103,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether there's a playoff for third place in the World Cup. Hmm let me think about how the World Cup works. From what I remember the tournament structure usually has groups where teams compete and then they move on to knockout stages.  In the knockout rounds if a team loses they're typically eliminated. But wait I think there's an exception for third place. I recall that after the semifinals the two losing teams from those matches don't just go home; instead they play against each other in what's called the third-place playoff or the bronze medal match.  So if Team A and Team B lose their respective semifinal games they then face off to determine who gets third place. That makes sense because it gives both teams a chance to end on a positive note rather than just being eliminated without another game. I think this has been a standard part of the World Cup for quite some time.  I don't remember any recent changes where they stopped having that playoff. It's also a way to give recognition to teams that made it far but didn't make the final. Plus it adds more games and excitement towards the end of the tournament.  So putting it all together yes there is a playoff for third place in the World Cup. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,126.88354879998951,0.046479013502069184,0.013647195374789244,0.0,0.0,0.0
104,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether New Hampshire has a sales tax or not. Let me start by recalling what I know about sales taxes in the United States. Each state can have its own rules regarding sales tax and some states don't have a general sales tax at all.  I remember that a few states like Alaska Delaware Montana New Hampshire and Oregon don't impose a statewide sales tax. But wait does that mean they have no sales tax at all? Or do they have local taxes instead?  Let me think about New Hampshire specifically. I've heard that it's one of the states without a general sales tax. Instead they might rely more on other forms of revenue like income taxes or excise taxes. But I'm not entirely sure if there are any exceptions or special cases where sales tax is applied.  I should also consider whether there are local sales taxes in New Hampshire. Even if the state doesn't have a general sales tax some cities or counties might impose their own. However from what I recall New Hampshire doesn't allow local jurisdictions to collect sales taxes either. So it's likely that there's no sales tax at all in the state.  To double-check I can think about major retailers in New Hampshire. If they don't charge sales tax that would support the idea that there's none. Also when I've looked up information before sources have mentioned that New Hampshire is one of the few states without a sales tax.  So putting it all together: New Hampshire does not have a state-level sales tax and local jurisdictions also don't impose sales taxes. Therefore the answer should be true. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,128.29064789999393,0.04700267848806226,0.013800954197025555,0.0,0.0,0.0
105,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether San Luis Rey de Francia was always a mission. Let me start by recalling what I know about missions in California. The Spanish established a series of missions along the coast right? They were part of the effort to colonize and convert Native Americans to Christianity.  San Luis Rey de Francia is one of those missions. I think it's located in Oceanside California. Now was it always a mission from its establishment until now? Well initially yes it was founded as a mission in 1798 by Father Fermín Lasuén. It served the usual purposes of missions: religious conversion education and economic activities.  But I also remember that after Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821 the missions went through a period called secularization. This meant that the control was transferred from the Catholic Church to local authorities. During this time many missions were either abandoned or repurposed. Some became ranches others fell into disrepair.  So after secularization San Luis Rey de Francia wasn't functioning as an active mission anymore. It probably went through periods of neglect and maybe even served other purposes. However in the 20th century there was a revival of interest in preserving these historical sites. The mission was restored and is now a popular tourist attraction and an active parish church.  Wait but does that mean it's still considered a mission? Well technically it started as a mission went through secularization and then was revived. So at times it wasn't functioning as a mission. Therefore it wasn't always a mission throughout its entire history. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,120.27250320001622,0.04405226053943744,0.012934650737715358,0.0,0.0,0.0
107,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's going to be a Season 4 of Total Bellas. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. Total Bellas is a reality TV series that focuses on the lives of professional wrestlers specifically the Bella Twins Brie and Nikki Bella. The show has been running for a few seasons now but I'm not exactly sure how many.  I think Season 1 was when they first started documenting their lives then Season 2 followed. After that there was Season 3 which I believe ended in 2020 or 2021. Now the question is about Season 4. I don't remember hearing any official announcements from WWE or the Bellas themselves about a new season.  I should check if there have been any recent news articles or interviews where they've mentioned it. Maybe looking up some entertainment news websites could help. Alternatively checking social media might provide some clues since celebrities often share updates there.  Wait I think I remember reading somewhere that the Bellas took a break from the show after Season 3. They were focusing on their wrestling careers and personal lives. But with the success of previous seasons it's possible they might return for another season in the future.  However as of my last update in October 2023 there hasn't been any official confirmation about Season 4. It could be that plans are still in development or that discussions are ongoing between the Bellas and WWE. Without a concrete announcement it's hard to say for sure if Season 4 will happen.  I should also consider the possibility that the show might not return due to various reasons like scheduling conflicts personal commitments or changes in the network's programming. But given the popularity of the series it's still plausible that they could come back.  In summary while there are no definite plans for Season 4 as of now nothing has been ruled out either. Fans might have to wait for official news from the creators or the Bellas themselves. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,120.64354489999823,0.04419035194157426,0.012975197216707555,0.0,0.0,0.0
106,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Kristen Bell sang all the voices of Anna. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about Kristen Bell and her role as Anna in Frozen. I remember that she played the character in both the 2013 movie and its 2019 sequel.   Wait but singing-wise wasn't there another voice involved? Oh right Idina Menzel was the voice of Elsa but what about Anna? I think Kristen Bell did provide some singing for Anna especially in the first movie. But then in the sequel Frozen II there were more songs and maybe different vocalists.  I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think: In the original Frozen Kristen Bell sang ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"" and other parts of the soundtrack. However for some of Anna's singing especially in the musical numbers was it all her? Or did someone else take over?  Wait I recall that in Frozen II there were more complex songs and maybe they used different vocalists for certain parts to match the tone or range needed. For example ""Into the Unknown"" is a big song and I think it's performed by Kristen Bell but perhaps with some additional help or layering.  But then again I'm not entirely sure if she sang all of Anna's voices in both movies. Maybe there were other singers contributing to her singing parts without being credited as the main voice actress. Or perhaps for certain tracks they used different vocalists to achieve a specific sound.  Alternatively maybe Kristen Bell did handle all the singing herself. I should check my memory: she was the lead actress and singer in Frozen so it's possible that she sang all of Anna's parts. But I'm not 100% certain because sometimes studios use multiple singers for different tracks to get the best performance.  Wait another angle: sometimes voice actors don't sing their own parts due to vocal range or other reasons. So maybe Kristen Bell provided some singing but others did as well. Or perhaps she did all of it herself. I'm a bit confused now.  I think I need to clarify this. From what I remember Kristen Bell was the main singer for Anna in Frozen including the songs like ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"" and parts of ""Let It Go"" (though that's more Elsa). In Frozen II she continued as Anna and sang several tracks but I'm not sure if every single vocal part was hers.  Wait no actually I think she did sing all the main songs for Anna in both movies. Maybe there were some background vocals or harmonies from others but the primary singing voice was Kristen Bell's. So perhaps the answer is yes she sang all the voices of Anna.  But now I'm second-guessing because sometimes even lead singers have help. For example in Disney movies it's common for the voice actress to sing the main parts but maybe not every single note. However in Frozen Kristen Bell was heavily involved in the singing so it's likely she did all of Anna's singing.  Wait another thought: sometimes when a character has multiple songs or different emotional states they might use different vocalists. But I don't recall any other singer being credited for Anna besides Kristen Bell. So maybe she did sing all the voices herself.  I think I'm overcomplicating this. The question is whether she sang all the voices of Anna. From what I know yes she did provide the singing voice for Anna in both movies. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,138.0885500999866,0.050584483497484525,0.014852645897749974,0.0,0.0,0.0
108,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if there's going to be a 14th season of Grey's Anatomy. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. It's been on for quite some time now—like over a decade. The latest seasons have had some changes like some main characters leaving or new ones being introduced.  I remember hearing that the show has been renewed multiple times but sometimes shows get canceled after a certain number of seasons. I should check when the last season aired. Let me think... Season 13 ended in March 2020. So if there was a 14th season it would have started airing around mid-2020 or early 2021.  Wait did they announce anything about a renewal after that? I'm not sure. Maybe I can think about the show's popularity. Grey's Anatomy has been pretty popular for years so maybe they're still going strong. But sometimes even popular shows get canceled if ratings drop or other issues arise.  I should also consider the actors' contracts and commitments. Some main cast members might have left or renewed their deals. For example Ellen Pompeo who plays Meredith Grey has been in talks about her contract before. If she agreed to stay that could mean more seasons. But I'm not certain if that's the case.  Another angle is looking at the show's storyline. After 13 seasons they might have wrapped up major story arcs or set up for a potential end. Maybe the writers are planning to conclude things in a way that doesn't require another season. Or perhaps they're still generating new content.  I can also think about similar shows and how long they lasted. Some medical dramas go on for 15-20 seasons so maybe Grey's Anatomy could too. But each show is different based on its audience and production decisions.  Wait I think I remember hearing that after Season 13 there was a delay in production due to the pandemic. Maybe that affected their plans for Season 14. Or perhaps they decided not to continue because of creative reasons or other factors.  I should also consider if any official announcements were made. If ABC (the network) hasn't renewed it then probably no 14th season. But without a clear announcement it's hard to say definitively.  Putting this all together: the show has been around for 13 seasons ended in 2020 and there's uncertainty about renewal due to various factors like contracts pandemic impacts creative direction and network decisions. Without concrete information I can't be sure if a 14th season is happening. </think>  False,False,True,0,0.0,133.23409830001765,0.048807265885995044,0.014330818213811857,0.0,0.0,0.0
109,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the October Revolution and the Bolshevik Revolution are the same thing. Let me start by recalling what each term refers to.  The October Revolution—I remember it happened in 1917 during World War I. It was led by the Bolshevik Party right? They overthrew the provisional government that had taken power after Tsar Nicholas II abdicated earlier that year. This revolution is often seen as a pivotal moment leading to the establishment of the Soviet Union.  Now the Bolshevik Revolution—since the Bolsheviks were the main group involved in the October Revolution it makes sense that these terms might be used interchangeably. The Bolsheviks were a faction within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Lenin. Their goal was to establish a socialist state based on Marxist principles.  I think both terms refer to the same event because they're talking about the same time period and the same group leading the revolution. However sometimes people might use ""Bolshevik Revolution"" more generally to encompass other related events or uprisings led by the Bolsheviks before October 1917. But in most historical contexts especially when referring to the major event that overthrew the provisional government they are the same.  So putting it all together yes the October Revolution is the same as the Bolshevik Revolution because both refer to the 1917 revolution led by the Bolshevik Party. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,127.69651490001706,0.046779189368939024,0.013735333189973015,0.0,0.0,0.0
111,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""Lord of All Hopefulness"" is a funeral hymn. First I should probably understand what the hymn is about. From what I remember ""Lord of All Hopefulness"" is a well-known Christian hymn. The title itself suggests themes of hope and trust in God.  I think the hymn was written by someone named John Ellerton maybe in the 19th century. It's often associated with funerals because it conveys comfort and reassurance during difficult times. The lyrics talk about trusting in God even when things are uncertain or sad.   But wait is it specifically a funeral hymn? I know that many hymns are used in various contexts not just funerals. However the themes of hope and trust can make it suitable for funerals where people seek comfort. I should check if this hymn is commonly sung at funerals or memorial services.  I recall hearing it played at a funeral once but I'm not entirely sure if that's its primary use. Maybe it's more about general hope rather than specifically for funerals. However the comforting nature of the hymn makes it appropriate for such occasions.   So putting it all together: while ""Lord of All Hopefulness"" isn't exclusively a funeral hymn its themes make it commonly used in funeral services to provide solace and remind attendees of eternal hope. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,127.4205065999995,0.04668668884075004,0.013708173130295542,0.0,0.0,0.0
110,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the heat from a hair dryer can kill lice. Let me start by recalling what I know about lice and how they're treated.  Lice are small insects that live on human heads and feed on blood. They lay eggs called nits which attach to hair strands. To get rid of them people often use treatments like shampoos with chemicals or other methods.  I remember hearing that heat can be effective against lice because it might kill the adults and the eggs. But I'm not sure exactly how much heat is needed. Hair dryers produce heat but does it get hot enough to kill lice?  I think some sources say that using a hair dryer on a high setting for about 30 seconds per section of hair can help. The idea is that the heat from the dryer would dehydrate and kill the lice. But I'm not certain if this method is reliable or if it's just a myth.  Also there are devices specifically made to kill lice using heat like lice combs with built-in heaters. These might be more effective because they can maintain a consistent temperature over the hair for longer periods. A regular hair dryer might not provide enough sustained heat to kill all the lice and their eggs.  Another thing to consider is that while heat can kill lice it's important to ensure that every part of the hair is treated thoroughly. Missing some sections could leave live lice behind leading to reinfestation.  I should also think about safety. Using a hair dryer too close or for too long might damage the hair or cause burns. So even if heat can kill lice it's crucial to use it correctly and safely.

112,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if a peck and a bushel are the same thing. Hmm I remember hearing both terms before but I'm not exactly sure what they measure or how they relate. Let me think about this step by step.  First I know that both peck and bushel are units of measurement probably for volume or capacity. They might be used in agriculture or for measuring grains or something like that. But are they the same? Or is one bigger than the other?  I recall that a bushel is a larger unit. Maybe it's used for bigger quantities while a peck is smaller. Let me try to remember any conversions I've come across. I think there's a saying or a rhyme about these units. Something like ""a bushel and a peck"" which makes me think they are related but different.  Wait in the nursery rhyme ""Mary had a little lamb "" it says she took it to school with a bushel and a peck of something. So that implies that a bushel is more than a peck. But how much exactly?  I think a bushel is equal to 4 pecks. Or maybe 2? Let me check my memory. No I'm pretty sure it's four. So if one bushel equals four pecks then they aren't the same. They are different units where a bushel is larger.  Alternatively maybe in some contexts they're used interchangeably but I don't think so. In standard measurements they have specific definitions. A bushel is a unit of dry volume and a peck is another unit within that system. So if one is four times the other they can't be the same.  I should also consider if there are different types or regions where these terms might mean something else. But I think in general usage especially in the US a bushel is larger than a peck. Therefore they aren't the same measurement. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,135.0284762000374,0.04947620803899223,0.014527233403561492,0.0,0.0,0.0
113,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether a cougar and a mountain lion are the same thing. Let me start by recalling what I know about these animals.   I remember hearing both terms used but I'm not entirely sure if they're different or just names for the same creature. Maybe it's like how some animals have multiple common names in different regions. For example I think a bobcat is sometimes called a wildcat so maybe cougar and mountain lion are similar.  Let me break this down. First what does each name refer to? A cougar is often associated with the Americas right? They're big cats but not as large as lions or tigers. Mountain lion also sounds like it's from North America maybe the Rocky Mountains or somewhere in the West.   I think both terms are used interchangeably. I've heard people call them pumas too. So cougar mountain lion and puma might all be names for the same species. That would make sense because different regions might have different common names for the same animal.  Wait but sometimes there can be subspecies or slight differences that lead to different names. Is that the case here? I don't recall cougars having distinct subspecies in North America that would warrant separate common names. They're all part of the same species Puma concolor.  Also considering their habitats: mountain lions are often associated with mountainous regions while cougars might be more general. But that doesn't mean they're different animals; it's just a regional naming difference based on where they're commonly found.  I should also think about scientific classification. If they were different species there would be distinct classifications. But I believe both cougar and mountain lion refer to Puma concolor which is the same species. So scientifically they are the same animal.  Another angle: looking at their physical characteristics. Do cougars and mountain lions look different? From what I know they have similar builds—slender powerful bodies tawny coats. No significant differences that would indicate separate species.  Cultural references might also play a role. In some areas one name is more commonly used than the other. For example in the Western United States mountain lion might be more prevalent while cougar could be used elsewhere. But again this doesn't change the fact that they're the same animal.  I should also consider any possible confusion with jaguars or other big cats. Jaguars are a different species altogether so that's not it. Cougars and mountain lions don't have spots like jaguars which helps confirm they're the same.  In summary after considering common names scientific classification physical characteristics and regional usage I'm pretty confident that cougar and mountain lion refer to the same animal. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,137.29392640001606,0.05031766227435087,0.014774301692744782,0.0,0.0,0.0
114,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether someone can die from a bullet shot into the air. Hmm let's break this down step by step.  First when someone fires a gun into the air the bullet goes up and then comes back down due to gravity. The initial velocity is high as it leaves the barrel but as it goes up gravity slows it down until it reaches its peak height and starts falling back down.   Now when the bullet is on its way up it's moving pretty fast maybe around 1000 feet per second or more depending on the gun. But once it starts coming down air resistance plays a role in slowing it down further. So by the time it hits the ground how fast is it going?  I remember hearing that bullets lose a lot of their speed as they fall back. Some sources say that a bullet fired straight up might only be moving at around 200-300 feet per second when it comes back down. That's still pretty fast but not nearly as fast as when it was first shot.  But can that speed cause death? Well bullets are designed to penetrate and cause damage so even at lower speeds they can be lethal if they hit a vital area. For example if someone is hit in the head or chest by a bullet traveling at 200-300 feet per second it could definitely be fatal.  I also recall that there have been real-life incidents where people were killed by bullets fired into the air. This usually happens in crowded areas where the falling bullet hits someone. So while the risk isn't as high as being shot directly it's still possible and dangerous.  Another thing to consider is the angle of descent. If the bullet falls at an angle it might retain more energy compared to a straight drop. But regardless any impact from a bullet can be lethal depending on where it hits.  So putting this all together: yes someone can die from a bullet shot into the air because even though the bullet slows down it still has enough velocity to cause fatal injuries upon impact. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,134.69519689999288,0.049369939151419975,0.014496030670076293,0.0,0.0,0.0
115,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out if the cards A 2 3 4 5 form a straight. Hmm let's start by recalling what a straight is in poker. A straight is five consecutive cards of any suit. So for example 6 7 8 9 10 would be a straight because each card follows the next without gaps.  Now considering the Ace here. In some contexts like in games where Ace can act as low or high an Ace can sometimes be used to make a straight with lower cards. For instance A-2-3-4-5 is often considered a straight known as a ""wheel"" in some poker variations. But wait I'm not sure if all rules consider this as a valid straight.  Wait in standard poker rules does an Ace count as low to make a straight with 2-3-4-5? Or is it only high making the highest possible straight 10-J-Q-K-A? Let me think. In most poker games like Texas Hold'em the Ace can be used as either high or low for straights. So A-2-3-4-5 would indeed be a straight because it's five consecutive cards when considering Ace as low.  But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people argue that in some contexts especially in certain games or rulesets the Ace can't be used both high and low. But no in standard poker it is allowed to use Ace as either high or low for straights but not both at the same time. So A-2-3-4-5 would count as a straight because they are consecutive when Ace is treated as 1.  Wait another thought: does this apply across all poker variants? For example in some games like Omaha do they treat it the same way? I think yes because the definition of a straight generally remains consistent across different poker types. So yeah A-2-3-4-5 should be considered a straight.  But just to double-check let me think about the numerical order. Ace is usually 1 in this context so 1 2 3 4 5 are consecutive numbers without any gaps. That makes it a straight. So yes A-2-3-4-5 is a straight. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,136.5626845000079,0.050062601190322874,0.014699410506724223,0.0,0.0,0.0
116,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the movie ""Vertical Limit"" is based on a true story. Let me start by recalling what I know about the film. It's an action thriller that came out in 2000 directed by Robert Schenkkan. The main plot involves a rescue team trying to save climbers trapped on Mount Everest after an avalanche.  I remember hearing that some movies are inspired by real events but others are completely fictional. I think ""Vertical Limit"" might be one of the latter because it has elements that seem exaggerated for dramatic effect. For example the extreme situations and the high-stakes rescue mission don't sound like something that would happen in a typical climbing expedition.  I should check if there were any real-life incidents similar to what's depicted in the movie. I know that Mount Everest has had its share of tragic events such as the 1996 Mount Everest disaster which was chronicled in Jon Krakauer's book ""Into Thin Air."" However that incident involved a storm and several deaths not an avalanche causing climbers to be trapped on a ledge.  Another point is the rescue team in the movie. In reality rescue operations on Everest are extremely challenging due to the altitude and weather conditions. While there have been rescues they're usually more limited in scope compared to what's shown in the film. The movie seems to take creative liberties with the scale of the rescue effort.  Additionally I don't recall any specific real-life event matching the plot of ""Vertical Limit."" It doesn't seem to be based on a true story but rather uses elements from climbing expeditions and disasters for its narrative. The characters and their interactions appear fictionalized to create tension and drama.  So putting it all together while the movie draws inspiration from the dangers of mountaineering and real-life risks climbers face the specific plot points and events are not based on an actual true story. </think>  False",False,False,1,1.0,133.33468290002202,0.0488722625679932,0.014349902577938958,0.0,0.0,0.0
117,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the Oakland Athletics have ever won a World Series. Let me start by recalling what I know about baseball teams and their championships.  First off the Oakland Athletics are a team based in Oakland California right? They play in the American League West division. Now I remember that winning the World Series is the ultimate goal for any Major League Baseball (MLB) team because it's the championship series between the best teams from the American and National Leagues.  I think the Athletics have had some success historically. There was a period when they were really strong maybe in the early 2000s? I recall something about them being called the ""Moneyball"" team because of their analytical approach to building the roster. That movie was based on their strategies around that time.  Wait but did they actually win the World Series during that era? Or was it just a lot of playoff appearances without winning the big prize? Let me think. I believe they won in 1989. Yes that's right. They were part of the ""Bash Brothers"" era with Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire. That team had some incredible power hitting and they took down the San Francisco Giants in the World Series.  But then after that did they win again? I'm not sure. There was another championship run maybe in 2014 or so? Or was that the San Francisco Giants again? No wait the Giants won in 2014. The Athletics were in the playoffs around that time but didn't win it all.  So putting this together: the Oakland A's have indeed won a World Series specifically in 1989. They haven't won since then but they did achieve that milestone at least once. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,136.21980409999378,0.049939624574828506,0.014663302040306206,0.0,0.0,0.0
118,<think> Okay so I need to figure out if you can buy alcohol on Sunday in Wisconsin. Let me start by recalling what I know about alcohol sales laws in the United States. Each state has its own rules and sometimes even within a state there might be variations depending on local ordinances.  I remember that some states have strict blue laws which restrict the sale of alcohol on Sundays especially for certain types like hard liquor. But other states are more relaxed. I think Wisconsin is one of those states where you can buy alcohol on Sunday but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.  Let me break it down. In Wisconsin I believe that grocery stores and some retail outlets sell beer and wine maybe even spirits on Sundays. However there might be restrictions on when exactly they can start selling. For example maybe after a certain time in the morning or early afternoon. I think some places open at 9 AM or 10 AM on Sundays for alcohol sales.  I should also consider that while larger stores might have extended hours smaller convenience stores or gas stations might not sell alcohol on Sundays at all or only during limited times. Additionally there could be exceptions in certain counties or municipalities within Wisconsin where local laws might further restrict Sunday sales.  Wait I'm a bit confused about whether spirits are allowed to be sold on Sundays. I think beer and wine are more commonly available but maybe hard liquor has different rules. Or perhaps all types of alcohol are permitted as long as it's after a specific time.  I should also remember that some states require a license to sell alcohol and the licensing might dictate when sales can occur. In Wisconsin if a store has a proper license they might be allowed to sell on Sundays but without one they can't. So it depends on where you're trying to buy from.  Another angle is looking at any recent changes in laws. Maybe there have been updates that allow or restrict Sunday sales more than before. I don't recall any major changes recently though.  Putting this all together my understanding is that yes you can buy alcohol on Sundays in Wisconsin but it might depend on the type of establishment and the specific time they're allowed to start selling. So overall the answer should be true because sales are permitted even if there are some restrictions on timing or location. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,136.99343110001064,0.050233528086610225,0.014749598162887276,0.0,0.0,0.0
119,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the liver is part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Let me start by recalling what the GI tract includes. The GI tract also known as the digestive system typically starts at the mouth and ends at the anus. It's a series of organs that work together to break down food into nutrients that the body can absorb.  The main parts I remember are the mouth esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine (colon) rectum and anus. These organs form a continuous pathway where digestion occurs. Now the liver is an organ in the abdomen but it's not part of this continuous pathway. Instead the liver produces bile which is stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine to help digest fats.  So while the liver plays a crucial role in digestion by producing enzymes and bile it isn't directly part of the GI tract itself. It's more like an accessory organ that supports the digestive process but doesn't form part of the actual tract through which food passes. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,132.918516500009,0.04874714549654522,0.014313165629580621,0.0,0.0,0.0
120,<think> Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether it's possible for a person to have twins with different fathers. Hmm let me think about this step by step.  First I know that twins usually come from the same mother and father because they develop at the same time in the womb. But wait there are different types of twins—like identical and fraternal. Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting into two so they share the same DNA. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two separate sperm cells.  Now if we're talking about someone having twins with different fathers that would mean each twin has a different biological father. How could that happen? Well I remember hearing something called heteropaternal superfecundation. Let me break that down. Superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two or more eggs from separate acts of intercourse within the same menstrual cycle. So if a woman has sex with two different men in quick succession it's possible for each egg to be fertilized by sperm from each man.  So theoretically if a woman releases two eggs and each is fertilized by sperm from different fathers she could have twins with different biological fathers. I think this is rare but possible. There might not be many documented cases but the biology seems plausible.  Wait are there any other factors? For example timing—how soon after each ejaculation would the sperm need to fertilize an egg? Sperm can survive in the female reproductive tract for a few days so if she has intercourse with two different men within that window it's possible. Also ovulation must occur around the same time as both encounters.  I should also consider if there are any medical conditions or procedures that could influence this. For instance artificial insemination or IVF might allow for such a scenario but I think the question is about natural conception. So in a natural setting it's possible through heteropaternal superfecundation.  Are there any real-life examples? I'm not sure of specific cases off the top of my head but I believe there have been documented instances where twins were found to have different fathers after DNA testing. That would confirm that it's possible.  So putting it all together: yes a person can have twins with different fathers through heteropaternal superfecundation where two eggs are fertilized by sperm from two different men within the same menstrual cycle. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,143.61402909999015,0.05267549703226699,0.015466610525876917,0.0,0.0,0.0
121,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the statement ""can anyone give last rites in an emergency"" is true or false. Let me break this down step by step.  First what are last rites? From what I remember last rites are religious ceremonies performed for someone who is dying or has just died. They're meant to provide comfort and prepare the person for death according to their faith's beliefs. The most common context I know is in Christianity particularly Catholicism where last rites include things like confession communion and anointing of the sick.  Now who typically administers these last rites? In the Catholic Church it's usually a priest or maybe a deacon. They have specific training and authority to perform these sacraments. But what happens in an emergency situation where there isn't a priest available?  I think I've heard that in emergencies if a priest can't be reached laypeople might step in. For example if someone is on their deathbed and the priest isn't accessible maybe a family member or another baptized Catholic could give communion as part of the last rites. But wait isn't there something about the anointing specifically requiring a priest? I'm not entirely sure.  Let me think about the rules. In the Catholic Church the Eucharist (communion) can be administered by any baptized Catholic in emergencies but the Anointing of the Sick is reserved for priests or deacons. So if someone needs last rites and only communion is possible because a priest isn't available then yes a layperson could give that part.  But does ""last rites"" refer to just the Eucharist or does it include all three parts: confession communion and anointing? If it's all three then in an emergency without a priest only the Eucharist can be given by a layperson. The other parts might not be fully administered.  So putting this together can anyone give last rites in an emergency? Well if ""anyone"" means any baptized Catholic then yes they can administer communion as part of the last rites. But if it's referring to all aspects of last rites requiring a priest then no only certain parts can be done by laypeople.  Wait but the question is whether anyone can give last rites in an emergency. If ""anyone"" includes laypersons who are baptized then yes they can at least provide communion. However if it's interpreted as any person regardless of their faith or baptism status that might not hold true because only baptized Catholics can administer certain parts.  I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify: in an emergency can a layperson give last rites? The answer seems to be yes for the Eucharist but no for the full set including anointing. So if the question is about giving any part of last rites then yes; if it's about administering all parts then only a priest can do that.  But the way the question is phrased is ""can anyone give last rites in an emergency."" It doesn't specify which parts. So perhaps the answer is true because at least some parts can be given by laypeople in emergencies. </think>  True",True,False,0,0.0,136.44051480002236,0.050048829645325706,0.014695366897554664,0.0,0.0,0.0
122,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the common femoral vein is a deep vein. Let me start by recalling what I know about veins and their classifications.  Veins are categorized into two main types: superficial and deep. Superficial veins lie just beneath the skin and aren't typically associated with major arteries. They have valves to help blood flow against gravity towards the heart. Deep veins on the other hand run alongside arteries in the body's deeper tissues and are usually larger playing a significant role in returning blood from the extremities back to the heart.  Now focusing on the common femoral vein specifically. I remember that the femoral region is in the thigh area. The common femoral vein is located near the inguinal ligament which is where the abdomen meets the leg. It's a major vein in the lower limb.   I think about how it relates to other structures. The common femoral vein drains blood from the lower extremity and is part of the venous system that eventually connects to the inferior vena cava. Since it's located deep within the thigh not close to the surface it must be a deep vein.  Also considering its anatomical position it runs alongside the femoral artery which is a major artery in the leg. Deep veins typically accompany arteries providing a direct return path for blood. This association supports that the common femoral vein is indeed a deep vein.  I don't recall any superficial veins being named ""common femoral."" Superficial veins in the thigh might include the great saphenous vein or small saphenous vein but those are different from the common femoral.   So putting it all together: location (deep within the thigh) association with an artery (femoral artery) and function (major venous return) all point to the common femoral vein being a deep vein. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,135.04572720002034,0.04954944616512686,0.014548737625379761,0.0,0.0,0.0
123,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether Garfield is a real cat in the movie. Hmm let's start by recalling what I know about Garfield. He's a popular comic strip character created by Jim Davis right? The comics usually portray him as a lasagna-loving lazy orange tabby cat who lives with his owner Jon Arbuckle and a dog named Odie.  Now there have been movies made about Garfield. I remember watching one of them when I was younger. In those movies Garfield is an animated character not a real cat. The animation style varies depending on the movie—some might use traditional 2D animation while others could be CGI. But regardless of the technique he's definitely drawn or computer-generated not a live-action cat.  Wait but maybe there was a version where they tried to use a real cat? I don't think so. The Garfield movies are all animated features. They might have used voice actors for the characters like Bill Murray voicing Garfield in some of them but that doesn't mean the cat is real. It's just the voice acting part.  Also considering how Garfield interacts with other characters and the environments in the movies it wouldn't make sense to use a real cat because they can't perform specific actions or dialogues consistently. Animation allows for more control over the character's movements and expressions which is necessary for storytelling in films.  So putting it all together Garfield in the movies isn't a real cat; he's an animated character. Therefore the answer should be False. </think>  False,False,False,1,1.0,138.25540700001875,0.05072715501127533,0.01489453719182904,0.0,0.0,0.0
124,<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the internal resistance of a battery changes. Hmm let's start by recalling what internal resistance is. From what I remember internal resistance is the opposition that a source of electrical energy (like a battery) offers to the flow of electric current. It's not just about the wires but also includes other components within the battery itself.  Now does this internal resistance stay constant or change? Well when a battery is new it probably has a certain level of internal resistance. But as time goes on and the battery ages things might start to change. Maybe the chemicals inside degrade which could affect how easily electrons can flow. That would mean the internal resistance increases.  Also temperature plays a role. If the battery gets hot or cold that might influence its internal resistance too. Higher temperatures could reduce resistance in some materials but for batteries it's more about chemical reactions. Maybe higher temps speed up reactions which could lower resistance initially but might cause other issues over time.  Another factor is how much the battery is used. If you discharge a battery completely or leave it charged for a long time that can affect its internal structure. Over-discharging might damage the electrodes increasing resistance. Similarly leaving it in a high state of charge without using it could lead to sulfation in lead-acid batteries which definitely increases internal resistance.  So putting this all together: as a battery ages undergoes temperature changes or is used (or not used) in certain ways its internal resistance does change. It doesn't stay the same throughout the battery's life. Therefore the answer should be that yes the internal resistance of a battery does change. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,135.4684124000196,0.049711941902061185,0.0145964497195578,0.0,0.0,0.0

I should check recent news to confirm. Maybe look up if there were any official statements from the network or the production company. Sometimes shows get renewed or canceled based on ratings and viewer engagement. If the show is still popular they might continue it but if ratings are dropping that could be a sign of cancellation.  Also considering the impact of streaming services some shows shift platforms rather than ending entirely. Perhaps ""The Young and the Restless"" moved to another platform instead of traditional TV. I should verify if there's any information about a move or a hiatus versus an outright cancellation.

127,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether the cortex of the cerebellum is made up of gray matter. Let me start by recalling what I know about brain structure.  The cerebellum is a part of the brain located at the back below the cerebral hemispheres. It's known for coordinating motor functions and balance. Now the term ""cortex"" usually refers to the outer layer of an organ. In the case of the cerebrum the cortex is indeed gray matter because it's made up of neuron cell bodies.  But wait does the same apply to the cerebellum? I remember that the cerebellum has a different structure compared to the cerebrum. The cerebellar cortex might have layers as well. Let me think about its composition. Gray matter consists of neuron cell bodies and unmyelinated axons while white matter is made up of myelinated axons.  The cerebellar cortex has three distinct layers: molecular layer Purkinje cell layer and granular layer. The Purkinje cells are large neurons located in the middle layer. Since these are neuron cell bodies that part would be gray matter. The molecular layer above them is mostly dendrites and axons which might still be considered gray because they're not myelinated. The granular layer below has small neurons called granule cells also part of gray matter.  So putting it all together the cerebellar cortex consists of these layers with neuron cell bodies making it gray matter. Therefore the answer should be true. </think>  True",True,True,1,1.0,122.24286759999814,0.04486327695822922,0.013172781857234936,0.0,0.0,0.0
126,"<think> Okay so I need to figure out whether ""The Greatest Showman"" is based on a true story. Let me start by recalling what I know about the movie. It's about P.T. Barnum and his creation of the Barnum & Bailey Circus. From what I remember the film portrays him as an entrepreneur who starts a circus that becomes very popular.  I think P.T. Barnum was a real person. He was a showman in the 19th century and did create a famous circus. So the basic premise is true. But movies often take creative liberties with historical events. I wonder how accurate ""The Greatest Showman"" is compared to the actual life of P.T. Barnum.  I should check if there were any real-life inspirations for the characters in the movie. For example was there a real Anne Wheeler who became Mrs. Barnum? I believe she was his wife so that part might be accurate. Also the idea of bringing together different performers from various backgrounds sounds plausible because circuses often featured a variety of acts.  However movies sometimes exaggerate or fictionalize certain aspects for dramatic effect. For instance the musical numbers and specific dialogues are likely not taken directly from real life. The emotional arcs and character development might be dramatized to make the story more engaging.  Another point is the timeline. Did all the events in the movie happen as depicted? I'm not sure about the exact sequence of events or how much time passed between them. Some parts might have been condensed or altered for storytelling purposes.  I also recall that ""The Greatest Showman"" received some criticism for its portrayal of certain historical figures and events suggesting that while it's inspired by real people it takes creative liberties with their stories.  So putting this together: the movie is based on a true story in that it's about P.T. Barnum and his circus but it's not a strict biographical account. It uses real-life inspirations but adds fictional elements to create a narrative. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,133.676495599997,0.04907685952457042,0.014409976457075233,0.0,0.0,0.0
