1,"The question asks whether ""static speaks my name"" is a horror game. To determine this I need to analyze the phrase and its possible meanings.  First ""static"" can refer to a low-frequency hiss or crackle often heard on poor-quality audio systems or in environments with electromagnetic interference. It's commonly associated with technology and communication issues.  Second ""speaks my name"" implies that something is calling out or addressing someone personally. Combining these two parts the phrase suggests a situation where static noise is somehow communicating or addressing an individual.  In the context of horror games many rely on creating an eerie atmosphere through sounds and visuals. Static could be used to build tension or signify something ominous. If ""static speaks my name"" is part of a game's title or narrative it might indicate that the game uses static as a central element to evoke fear or suspense.  However without specific information about a game titled ""Static Speaks My Name "" I cannot definitively confirm whether such a game exists in the horror genre. It could be a hypothetical concept rather than an actual released game.  Therefore based on the analysis of the phrase and its potential implications in the context of horror games it is plausible but not certain that ""static speaks my name"" refers to a horror game. </think>  False",False,True,0,0.0,3.852159900005063,0.0013515327315695087,0.0003968378382714714,0.0,0.0,0.0

23,Yes some states in the United States do not have mandatory seat belt laws for all vehicle occupants. As of now 16 states and the District of Columbia have primary enforcement laws meaning officers can ticket drivers specifically for not wearing a seat belt. However there are states where seat belt laws are either secondary enforcement (meaning an officer can only ticket someone for not wearing a seat belt if they were pulled over for another reason) or no seat belt laws at all. For example as of recent information New Hampshire does not have a state law requiring adults to wear seat belts. It's always best to check the most current laws for specific states.,False,True,0,0.0,2.126068399997166,0.0007297389538633203,0.00021426638230012538,0.0,0.0,0.0

77,"The question of whether there was a consumer revolution in the eighteenth century is a subject of historical debate. Some historians argue that the 18th century saw the beginnings of a consumer revolution particularly in Europe and the Americas characterized by changes in consumption patterns the rise of a middle class with more disposable income and the growth of markets for goods such as tea coffee sugar and textiles. Others may emphasize that the term ""revolution"" might be an overstatement suggesting instead a gradual evolution in consumer behavior.  Given this context the answer is:  **True**  This conclusion acknowledges the significant changes in consumption patterns during the 18th century without necessarily using the term ""revolution "" thus aligning with a balanced historical perspective.",True,True,1,1.0,2.3608714999973017,0.0008198068703392052,0.0002407121770907545,0.0,0.0,0.0

80,The question is whether the host country has ever won the World Cup. To determine this I need to consider historical data of the FIFA World Cup.  1. **Understanding the World Cup Hosting and Winning**: The FIFA World Cup is a global football tournament where a specific country hosts the event. However winning the tournament is determined by the performance of the national team representing that country during the competition.  2. **Historical Context**: Many countries have hosted the World Cup but not all host countries have won the tournament. For example:   - Brazil hosted the 1950 World Cup and won.   - South Africa hosted in 2010 but did not win; the winner was Spain.  3. **General Trend**: While some host countries have gone on to win the tournament it is not a guaranteed outcome. Hosting primarily involves organizing the event rather than directly influencing the performance of the national team.  4. **Conclusion**: Since some host countries have won the World Cup (e.g. Brazil in 1950) it is accurate to say that yes the host country has sometimes won the World Cup. </think>  True,True,True,1,1.0,3.3065653999983624,0.0011756795396101307,0.00034520372026586646,0.0,0.0,0.0

86,"The question asks whether there's a difference between the .300 Blackout (300 BLK) and the .300 AAC Blackout.   First I need to understand what each of these terms refers to.  The "".300 Blackout"" typically refers to the .300 BLK cartridge which is a rimless bottlenecked case designed for use in AR-15 style firearms. It was developed by Advanced Armament Corporation (AAC) and introduced in 2010. The .300 BLK uses a .308 Winchester projectile and has a shorter case length than the .308 Win making it suitable for short-barreled rifles (SBRs).  The "".300 AAC Blackout"" is another name for the same cartridge. ""AAC"" stands for Advanced Armament Corporation which developed the round. So essentially both terms refer to the same cartridge.
