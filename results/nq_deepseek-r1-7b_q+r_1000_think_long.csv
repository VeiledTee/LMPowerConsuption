Question: who is the owner of reading football club
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who owns Reading Football Club. The context provided mentions that the club's owners are Dai Yongge and Dai Xiuli with Dai Yongge holding the majority. They are from China. I should make sure to include both names since they're both part of the ownership.  I also notice that Reading Football Club was founded in 1871 which is a bit old but the question is about ownership not founding date. The club has been owned by Dai Yongge and Dai Xiuli with Dai Yongge having the majority. There's no mention of other owners or changes to the ownership structure.  I should present this information clearly. So the answer would be that Dai Yongge and Dai Xiuli are the owners.

Question: who was the first lady nominated member of the rajya sabha
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the first lady nominated member of the Rajya Sabha (which is the Indian Lok Sabha's equivalent in the state) was. The context provided mentions Roopa Ganguly and her involvement from 2016 to 2022. I'm assuming that she might be the answer but let me think through this step by step.  First what do I know about the Rajya Sabha? It's part of the Parliament in India right? And it's composed of members who are nominated by the President according to certain rules. One key rule is that they must have been members of either the rajya Sabha or the Vidhan Sabha (the state legislature) for a minimum period.  Now considering the question about the first woman to be nominated I should check if Roopa Ganguly fits this criterion. The name Roopa makes me think she might be from Assam because ""Roopa"" is a term used by locals there. But I'm not entirely sure of her political background before 2016.  Looking at the context again: it mentions she was involved from 2016 to 2022. That suggests she was already a member or had been nominated in that period. So if she was part of the Rajya Sabha during that time and meets the criteria for nomination (being a member of either Sabha) then she could very well be the first woman nominated.  I don't recall any other prominent Indian women getting into Rajya Sabha before 2016 so it's plausible that Roopa Ganguly was the first. Her name is associated with political roles in India around that time which aligns with the timeframe given in the context.

Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out the cast of Law & Order: SVU based on the provided context. Let me look through the data given.  First I'll scan each row for any mention of ""SVU"" or the show's title. The context includes a list where each character has their rank position seasons they appeared in and sometimes notes about recurring roles or guest stars.  Looking at each entry:  - Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler: He appears from Season 1 to 12 so definitely part of SVU. - Mariska Hargitay as Olivia Benson: She's a Lieutenant from Season 1 onwards until Season 15 and 17. So she's in SVU. - Richard Belzer as John Munch: DA Investigator since Season 1 to 16 so he's part of the team. - Dann Florek as Donald Cragen: Captain from Season 1 to 15 which includes his role in SVU. - Michelle Hurd as Monique Jeffries: Detective from Season 1 to 2. She was a recurring guest later too but started in SVU. - Stephanie March as Alexandra Cabot: Also a District Attorney from Seasons 1-5 and again 9 onwards. Important to note her role expanded beyond the initial season. - Ice-T Odafin as Tutuola: Detective in Season 2. A familiar face. - Tamara Tunie as Melinda Warner: Medical Examiner since Season 7 to 12 so part of SVU from that point. - B.D. Wong as George Huang: FBI Special Agent in Season 4 and onwards until 15. His role was significant with SVU. - Diane Neal as Casey Novak: Senior Assistant District Attorney in Seasons 5-9 which includes her time on SVU. - Adam Beach as Chester Lake: Detective starting from Season 8 to 16 so he's part of the team throughout that period.  I think these are all the main cast members who appeared in various seasons of SVU. Some might have only been guests or recurring but their primary roles were within SVU like Monique Jeffries later on.  The cast of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (SVU) includes:  - Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler - Mariska Hargitay as Olivia Benson - Richard Belzer as John Munch - Dann Florek as Donald Cragen - Michelle Hurd as Monique Jeffries - Stephanie March as Alexandra Cabot - Ice-T Odafin as Tutuola - Tamara Tunie as Melinda Warner - B.D.

It was founded by the York philanthropist , Joseph Rowntree , who was quoted as saying , `` I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities '' . The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin , after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust ( now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust ) was established to continue building and manage the new village . The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation .
Question: who designed the garden city of new earswick
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who designed the garden city of New Earswick. Let me start by reading through the provided context carefully.  From the context I see that New Earswick is described as a mixed community built with housing for both workers and managers. It's in a green setting with gardens for each home and two fruit trees per home. It was founded by Joseph Rowntree an philanthropist from York. He mentioned that he wanted communities to be properly ordered and self-governing not just charities.  The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 by Raymond Unwin. After that the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust was established to continue building and managing the village. It's also noted that this trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.  So putting this together New Earswick was designed in two parts: first by Raymond Unwin for the initial 28 houses between 1902 and 1904. Later on when the trust took over they continued managing it. Therefore the primary designer of the garden city would be Raymond Unwin.  Wait a second does that mean only Unwin was responsible? Or did the Trust also contribute to design later on? The question is asking who designed it so since the first part was by Unwin and after that the trust took over but they were established afterward. So I think the answer would focus on who was the main designer during construction.  Yes Raymond Unwin was the architect responsible for building the initial part of New Earswick. The Joseph Rowntree Trust managed it later on so maybe they didn't design from scratch after that period.  The garden city of New Earswick was designed by Raymond Unwin., garden city of new earswick was designed by raymond unwin,Raymond Unwin,0,0.33333333333333337,3.0806049999955576,0.0010718370478508899,0.0003147134265512589,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light , found even in unicellular organisms , called `` eyespots '' . Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness : they can distinguish light from dark , sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms . They are insufficient for vision , as they can not distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from . Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups , and are common among unicellular organisms , including euglena . The euglena 's eyespot , called a stigma , is located at its anterior end . It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals . Together with the leading flagellum , the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light , often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis , and to predict day and night , the primary function of circadian rhythms . Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms , and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles . By detecting the subtle changes in night - time illumination , organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation .
Question: what is the first step in the evolution of the eye
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the first step in the evolution of the eye based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context starts by talking about photoreceptor proteins called eyespots found even in unicellular organisms like Euglena. It mentions that these eyespots can only sense ambient brightness which is sufficient for things like photoperiodism and circadian rhythms but aren't enough for vision. They can't distinguish shapes or direction.  It goes on to say that while eyespots are common among major animal groups and unicellular organisms they're just a part of how these single-celled organisms interact with their environment. The example given is Euglena which has a stigma at its anterior end—a small red pigment spot that covers light-sensitive crystals.  Then the context shifts to more complex organisms where visual pigments are found in the brain and help synchronize spawning with lunar cycles by detecting changes in nighttime illumination.  So putting this together the first step would be from simple eyespots (eyespots as a precursor) leading to more complex vision systems. The eyespots themselves aren't sufficient for vision but serve as an early step towards it.  The first step in the evolution of the eye is the development of photoreceptor proteins called eyespots which enable organisms to sense ambient brightness and support basic functions like circadian rhythms., first step in evolution of eye is development of photoreceptor proteins called eyespots which enable organisms to sense ambient brightness and support basic functions like circadian rhythms,"photoreceptor proteins that sense light, found even in unicellular organisms, called ""eyespots""",0,0.358974358974359,2.519537499989383,0.0008640939027275544,0.00025371576167730153,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who died in the plane crash greys anatomy
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who died in the plane crash from Grey's Anatomy. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. The question is specifically asking for who died so I should focus on that.  From the context provided after their plane crashes several characters are involved: Meredith Lexie Cristina Arizona Derek and Mark. It mentions that Meredith was relatively unscathed which means she survived. So I can eliminate Meredith right away.  Next it talks about Jerry having a major spine injury but since Jerry isn't one of the main five probably not relevant here unless he's part of the plane crew. The pilot is mentioned as Jerry with a serious injury so maybe that's just additional info.  Yang dislocates her arm and later has internal injuries too. So Yang seems to have survived but was injured worse than others like Arizona whose femur broke through the skin.  Then there's Sloan who had serious internal injuries. It says he's initially kept on his feet by adrenaline so he might survive longer than others. But then it mentions that he wakes up alone because his mangled hand was pushed through the door.  Shepherd is with Mark initially but ends up being sucked out of the plane and wakes up alone too. So Shepherd probably didn't make it either.  The key part is where it says that none could save Lexie so Sloan holds her hand as she dies telling her he loves her. Then as Sloan tells her about their life together Lexie dies with a smile as Meredith and Yang approach.  So putting this together: The main five (Meredith Cristina Arizona Derek Mark) all survive? Wait no because the context says that Lexie is crushed under debris so she's dead. So who died?  From what I see Lexie dies along with the others except Meredith and Yang but wait it mentions that none could save her so yes she dies.  Wait let me recheck: The plane crash has six people: Meredith Lexie Cristina Arizona Derek Mark. From the context:  - Meredith is unscathed. - Lexie is crushed under debris (dies). - Yang is dislocated arm but probably survives? Wait no the question says ""who died in the plane crash greys anatomy"". So let me make sure.  The context describes that after the crash Meredith searches for Shepherd. Yang and Sloan try to move debris off Lexie. Eventually they realize they can't save her so Sloan holds her hand as she dies. Then as he tells her about their life together Lexie dies with a smile. So Lexie is dead.  But also the pilot Jerry has major injuries but maybe survives? Or does he die too?  Wait the context says that after the crash the rest have serious injuries: pilot (Jerry) with major spine Yang dislocates arm Arizona femur through skin Sloan internal Shepherd mangled hand. Then it says none could save Lexie so they realize she's dead.  So who died? The immediate fatalities are Lexie and perhaps others too. Let me parse the context step by step:  - Plane crashes in woods. - Meredith is unscathed (alive). - The rest: pilot (Jerry) has major spine injury (alive?) Yang dislocates arm Arizona femur through skin Sloan internal injuries Shepherd mangled hand.  Wait but the plane crash would have immediate deaths. The context says that after the crash:  - Meredith is relatively unscathed. - The rest have serious injuries:   - pilot: Jerry has major spine injury   - Yang dislocates her arm (so she's injured)   - Arizona femur through skin   - Sloan serious internal   - Shepherd mangled hand  Then the group realizes they can't save Lexie so she dies. Then as Sloan tells Lexie about their life together Lexie dies with a smile.  Wait that seems contradictory because if someone is dead and then Lexie is also dead but maybe it's indicating that she died but was smiling before her death? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.  But the key points are:  - The plane crash: Meredith is fine. - Others have injuries:   - Jerry (pilot) with major spine   - Yang dislocates arm   - Arizona broken femur   - Sloan internal injuries   - Shepherd mangled hand  Then the group realizes Lexie can't be saved. So Lexie dies.  But who else dies? Let me see: The context mentions that the two realize they cannot save her (Lexie) so she dies. Then as Sloan tells her of their life together Lexie dies with a smile just as Meredith and Yang approach.  Wait but if Lexie is dead when she's being told about their life together by Sloan then perhaps she was killed after that moment? Or maybe it's implying she's in the process of dying. The wording is a bit confusing.  But focusing on who died: From the main group (Meredith Lexie Cristina Arizona Derek Mark) Meredith is alive. So the rest—Lexie Yang Arizona Sloan Shepherd and Jerry—all have serious injuries but it's implied that most don't survive except possibly the pilot? Or maybe the pilot dies too.  Wait no: The context doesn't mention anything about the pilot surviving or dying beyond his major spine injury. So perhaps he survives with that injury.  But let's stick to who is definitively dead in the show:  From what I remember in the plane crash season of Grey's Anatomy the pilot (Jerry) dies from the injuries sustained. The others: Meredith survives; Lexie and Yang are killed along with the rest except Meredith.  Wait but according to the context given here:  - Lexie is crushed under debris so she dies. - Yang dislocates her arm but maybe survives unless she's dead too. But wait no—Yang might not be dead if she's just injured. The question is who died in the plane crash.  So putting it together: The plane has Meredith (alive) Lexie (dies when they realize they can't save her) and the others may have survived injuries but died later? Or perhaps they all die except Meredith.  Wait no—actually I think that's not correct. Let me try to clarify:  After the crash:  - Meredith is unscathed. - The rest: pilot (Jerry) survives with major spine injury; Yang dislocates her arm and dies because she was crushed under debris? Or maybe she survives but is injured.  Wait no—Yang is with the plane when it crashes. If she's dislocated and being crushed by debris then she dies along with others except Meredith.  So in this crash who died?  From the context:  - Lexie is crushed under debris and dies. - Yang's arm is dislocated but perhaps survives unless her death was immediate. But according to the question: ""who died in the plane crash Greys anatomy"". So based on the provided context it says that none could save Lexie so she dies. Then as Sloan tells her of their life together Lexie dies with a smile just as Meredith and Yang are approaching.  Wait but if Lexie dies when she's being told about their life together by Sloan then perhaps she was killed after that moment. But the context says she's dead at that point.  Alternatively maybe in reality Lexie is killed by the debris crushing her under which would be a separate incident from being told of their life together.  But according to the given information:  - Lexie dies when they realize they can't save her (dies immediately) - Then as Sloan tells her about their life together she dies with a smile as Meredith and Yang approach.  Wait that seems contradictory. If she's dead when being told of their life together then perhaps she's already dead at that point. But the wording is confusing.  Given that in the context provided it says that after realizing they can't save her she dies which happens while Sloan is holding her hand. Then as he tells her about their life together Lexie dies with a smile just as Meredith and Yang approach.  So perhaps Lexie was alive when told of their life together but then dies immediately afterward explaining the smile as if she's preparing to die but unfortunately can't make it it that moment.  Alternatively maybe she was crushed under debris and thus dead before being told of their life together.  But based on the context provided the order is: Lexie dies when they realize they can save her then she dies with a smile as Meredith and Yang approach. So perhaps Lexie survived until that point but then died right then.  So in total who died? From the list:  Meredith survives. Lexie dies (crushed under debris or killed after being told their life together). Yang: dislocated arm; if she was crushed she dies; else survives but is injured. Same with Arizona Sloan Shepherd and Jerry.  But according to the context given in the question Lexie is dead when they realize they can't save her. Then as Sloan tells her of their life together she dies with a smile just as Meredith and Yang approach.  So from that only Lexie dies but that doesn't make sense because it's implied others are also killed. Wait perhaps the key point is that all except Meredith die in the plane crash.  But I think that's not accurate; typically only Lexie dies in this scenario. Let me verify my memory: In season 13 of Grey's Anatomy during the pilot episode (Plane CRash) it's established that Lexie dies after being crushed under debris. The others survive with injuries but are still alive until later seasons where some pass away.  So based on that only Lexie died in the plane crash.

Kylo Ren is also the master of the Knights of Ren , as well as a commander and later the supreme leader of the First Order , an organization spawned from the fallen Galactic Empire . He is featured in The Force Awakens media and merchandising and appears in the film 's sequel , Star Wars : The Last Jedi ( 2017 ) .
Question: where does kylo ren's name come from
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where Kylo Ren's name comes from based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that Kylo Ren is a fictional character from Star Wars. He was introduced in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and portrayed by Adam Driver. It mentions that Kylo Ren is Ben Solo who was the son of Han Solo and Leia Organa. So I'm thinking his name comes from his father's name.  Han Solo is one of the main characters from the original Star Wars trilogy particularly from Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. He had a lot of adventures in that story. But specifically Ben Solo was known as a Sith Lord before he joined the First Order under Snoke. His background is somewhat tied to the Kyber crystal because he used it.  Wait but the name itself... The context doesn't explicitly say where his first name comes from except that he's the son of Han Solo and Leia Organa. So perhaps his last name ""Ren"" might have a specific origin. Let me think: In some Star Wars lore the Ren family is associated with the Sith Order particularly from the Kyber situation. The Kyber crystal was involved in many conflicts so maybe ""Ren"" relates to that.  Looking at the context again it says that Kylo Ren is also known as Ben Solo and that he trained under Luke Skywalker but was seduced by Snoke. He aspires to be like Darth Vader and is a master of Knights of Ren and later the supreme leader of First Order. It mentions he's featured in media and appears in ""The Last Jedi.""  So putting it all together the name Kylo Ren comes from his father Ben Solo. The last name ""Ren"" might have roots in the Sith culture possibly connected to Kyber or some other tradition within the Star Wars lore.  I don't see any other explicit sources for where the name Ren comes from except that Ben Solo's family is called Ren because of their connection through the Kyber crystal or Sith heritage. So it's likely a part of his character's backstory and the Sith House Ren.  Kylo Ren's name originates from his father Ben Solo. The last name ""Ren"" is associated with the Sith House Ren reflecting his background in the Sith Order and its ties to the Kyber crystal.",kylo rens name originates from his father ben solo last name ren is associated with sith house ren reflecting his background in sith order and its ties to kyber crystal,"the character, ""came to the name Kylo Ren when he joined a group called the Knights of Ren.""",0,0.18181818181818182,3.8916865000064718,0.0013624032881200609,0.0004000296575012724,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: Prior to 1940 the term `` jeep '' had been used as U.S. Army slang for new recruits or vehicles , but the World War II `` jeep '' that went into production in 1941 specifically tied the name to this light military 4x4 , arguably making them the oldest four - wheel drive mass - production vehicles now known as SUVs . The Jeep became the primary light 4 - wheel - drive vehicle of the United States Army and the Allies during World War II , as well as the postwar period . The term became common worldwide in the wake of the war . Doug Stewart noted : `` The spartan , cramped , and unstintingly functional jeep became the ubiquitous World War II four - wheeled personification of Yankee ingenuity and cocky , can - do determination . ''
Question: what type of car is a jeep considered
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what type of car a Jeep is considered based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by saying that before 1940 ""jeep"" was slang for new recruits or vehicles in the U.S. Army. But then it mentions that during World War II starting in 1941 the term became tied specifically to a light military 4x4 vehicle. It also notes that these became known as SUVs which are the oldest four-wheel drive mass production vehicles.  So from this I gather that before WWII jeeps were just vehicles or used by new recruits but during the war and after they evolved into specific types of vehicles—light military 4x4s. These later became associated with SUVs because they're four-wheel drive and were mass-produced.  Doug Stewart describes them as ""the spartan cramped and unstintingly functional jeep "" which highlights their practicality. They were primary light 4x4 vehicles for the U.S. Army and Allies during WWII and postwar periods and the term spread worldwide after the war.  Putting this together a Jeep is primarily considered a four-wheel drive vehicle specifically a light military 4x4 that later became an SUV. So when someone asks what type of car a Jeep is it's safe to say it's a four-wheel drive car or specifically a light 4x4 military vehicle.

From the context provided I know that Manchester United is a football club based in England and they play in the Premier League. The context mentions something about Old Trafford but doesn't explicitly state it as the name of their stadium.  Wait the context says ""moved to its current stadium Old Trafford in 1910."" That part might be key. So maybe that's where they built their main stadium? I should check if Old Trafford is indeed known for a football stadium or if it's more famous as an event venue like for baseball or something else.  I recall hearing about the old Trafford stadium being a prominent venue but was it specifically for football? Maybe in the context of Manchester United that's where they played. Since the question is asking for the name of Manchester United's stadium and the only mention related to their stadium is Old Trafford I think that's the answer.  I don't see any other information about another stadium here so unless there are multiple stadiums which doesn't seem to be the case based on this context Old Trafford must be their main stadium. So putting it all together the name should be Old Trafford Stadium.  Old Trafford",old trafford,Old Trafford,1,1.0,2.1339863000030164,0.000739802721702831,0.0002172213117524514,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who is rose in the fall season 2
Answer: ","Alright let's try to figure this out. The question is asking about ""Rose"" in the ""Fall"" season 2. From what I remember the name ""Rose"" refers to Valene Kane also known as Rose Stagg. She had a significant role in the first season of the show particularly with her relationship with Paul and the incident involving the strangler.  Now the user mentioned ""The Fall Season 2."" So I need to check if there's a character named Rose in the second season. Given that the name is tied closely to the first season's storyline it's possible that either Valene returns or there's another character with the same name.  Wait but considering the context provided it seems like Valene is the focus and she might have been involved in a different story arc in Season 2. Alternatively maybe ""Rose"" refers to someone else perhaps her friend or a new character introduced later on.  I should also consider that sometimes shows introduce new characters or continue existing ones. If Rose Stagg isn't mentioned again it's possible that the show didn't develop her further into another season or that she's part of a different storyline now.  But without specific details about Season 2 I can't be certain. However based on the information given ""Rose"" is most likely Valene Kane and if she appears in Season 2 it would probably tie back into her past storylines like her kidnapping or her husband's knowledge of the crime.  So putting it all together Rose in The Fall Season 2 is likely Valene Kane continuing from where Season 1 left off.  Rose in ""The Fall"" Season 2 refers to Valene Kane. She continues to be a significant character likely tying back into her past storylines such as her kidnapping and the incident involving Paul.",rose in fall season 2 refers to valene kane she continues to be significant character likely tying back into her past storylines such as her kidnapping and incident involving paul,Valene Kane,0,0.125,3.1827319000003627,0.0011064002415928492,0.0003248618918957786,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what is the corporate tax rate in great britain
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the current corporate tax rate in Great Britain based on the provided context. Let me go through the information step by step.  First the context mentions that the original classical system was reintroduced in 1999 after being abolished earlier. It also talks about changes made over time including splitting the main tax rate into three parts and reducing it to 20% as of April 2015 due to tax competition between jurisdictions.  So the key point here is that the corporate tax rate was reduced from 28% in 2008-2010 to a flat rate of 20% starting in April 2015. I should check if there have been any changes after that date because the question doesn't specify an exact period but usually such reductions are permanent unless stated otherwise.  Looking at the context again it only mentions this reduction in 2015 and doesn't talk about further changes post-2015. Therefore I can conclude that as of the latest information provided the corporate tax rate remains at 20%.  The current corporate tax rate in Great Britain is **20%**., current corporate tax rate in great britain is 20,a flat rate of 20%,0,0.30769230769230765,2.1779972999938764,0.0007529052548318507,0.0002210684852624576,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what is the meaning of the name sinead
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out the meaning of the name Sinead based on the context provided. The context mentions that Sinéad Ní Shúilleabháin is a fictional character from ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley."" Hmm okay but how does that help me understand what ""Sinead"" means?  Let me break it down. The name Sinead has parts: ""Sin"" and ""e "" and ""e"" plus ""ad."" Maybe those parts have meanings too. I know that ""Sin"" is a term of origin from Irish related to sinethe which might mean something like ""a river"" or ""watercourse."" So maybe that's part of it.  Then there's the ""e"" sound in Sinead. That could be shortening another word or just part of the name. The rest is ""ad "" which often means ""to"" or can have other meanings depending on context. Maybe ""Sinead"" itself doesn't have a direct meaning but comes from parts that relate to words with broader meanings.  I also recall that in Irish names sometimes they add ""-e"" to make the name more distinct or natural-sounding. So perhaps Sinead is a variation of a longer name like Sinethe or something similar shortened for convenience. That might be it.  Putting it together ""Sinead"" likely originates from an Irish root meaning ""river"" or watercourse combined with a shortening suffix ""-e "" making the whole name easier to say and use in conversation.

Question: which five year plan was affected by indo pak indo china war
Answer: ","Alright I'm trying to figure out which Five-Year Plan in India was affected by the Indo-Pak Indo-China War. Let's break this down.  First I know that India has several Five-Year Plans aimed at economic development. The question mentions the ""five year plan "" so it's referring to one of these plans.  The Indo-Pak Indo-China War—wait that doesn't sound right. Usually wars between India and Pakistan are called the ""Civil War"" because they were part of British colonial territories. The actual war would be more likely referred to as the ""India-Pakistan War"" or just ""Civil War."" However if we're considering a conflict between India Pakistan and China that might refer to specific incidents during the 1980s involving tensions between these regions.  Looking at history in 1984 there was an incident known as the ""China-Indoor War"" where tensions flared between China and India. This led to a Chinese military airstrike on a Indo-Pakistani camp near Jammu which killed many. This event is significant because it escalated regional tensions.  Now considering Five-Year Plans in India:  1. 1950-55: Focused on infrastructure like railways roads. 2. 1957-62: Shifted to heavy industry and agriculture. 3. 1962-67: Post-independence focused on economic growth. 4. 1967-72: Concentrated on industrialization. 5. 1972-77: Addressed poverty and regional development.  The event in 1984 falls between the 1973-77 plan (which was actually a continuation of the 1967-72 plan) or perhaps after that maybe overlapping with the 1977-82 plan. However the Five-Year Plans only run for five years so each started in odd-numbered years.  Wait the Five-Year Plans were from 1950 to 1980 as follows:  - 1950-55 - 1955-60 (not commonly referred) - Actually India's Five-Year Plans are typically five consecutive fiscal years. So starting in 1953: 1953-57? Wait no the first was from July 1 1948 to June 30 1953.  But more accurately they were:  1. 1953–57 (First Five Year Plan) 2. 1957–61 3. 1961–66 4. 1966–71 5. 1971–76  Wait no the correct timeline is:  The First Five Year Plan: 1953-1957 Second: 1957-1962 Third: 1962-1967 Fourth: 1967-1972 Fifth: 1972-1977  So the event in 1984 would be after all these plans. But perhaps a plan was affected if the war directly impacted its execution.  Alternatively maybe I'm misunderstanding the context of "" Indo-China War."" Perhaps it refers to a specific war or incident between India and China during that period which led to disruptions in economic planning.  Wait another thought: The Five-Year Plans in India were part of larger long-term plans. If an external event like a military conflict disrupted certain projects or investments it might affect the plan's timeline or outcomes.  But considering 1984 after the Fifth Plan (ended in 1977) so no direct impact on that plan. Alternatively maybe during the planning phase of one of the later plans?  Alternatively perhaps the answer refers to a specific Five-Year Plan where significant disruptions happened due to the war but I'm not recalling an exact instance.  Wait another approach: The India-China border dispute in the 1980s led to increased military tensions. This could have disrupted infrastructure projects or economic development activities potentially affecting ongoing plans.  But since the Fifth Five-Year Plan ended in 1977 and the next one started in 1978 it's unclear if there was a direct impact on that plan.  Alternatively maybe the answer is referring to the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-91) which faced disruptions due to military actions. But I'm not sure about this as India moved towards reforms after 1991 with the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-96).  Wait perhaps a better approach: The major event in 1984 affected the economic development plans of the time leading to disruptions. However given that the user is asking for which specific Five-Year Plan was affected by the Indo-China war it's possible they're referring to the period around when that war occurred.  Alternatively maybe the answer refers to a Five-Year Plan in the 1980s being disrupted but I can't recall an exact match.  Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another angle: The question mentions ""five year plan"" and ""indo pak indo china war."" Maybe it's referring to the 1967-72 Five-Year Plan because that period included the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 which is often referred to as the ""War of 1965."" But no that was a separate event.  Wait the Indo-China War in question is more likely the 1984 incident. However in the context provided it's about providing access to banking services to 90% of households which might relate to economic growth plans affected by external disruptions.  But since I'm supposed to provide a concise answer based on the context given perhaps the correct Five-Year Plan is the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-91) but I'm not certain. Alternatively maybe it's the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1976–81) which was impacted by military actions.  Wait another thought: The major disruption happened around 1984 so if the Five-Year Plans were annual perhaps the plan active during that time was affected. For example starting in 1975-76 would be after the Fifth Plan and before the Sixth (1976–81). But I'm not sure.  Alternatively considering that the context is about banking access for 90% of households which might have been impacted by economic challenges from external factors like war perhaps the answer refers to a specific plan affected during those times. However without exact information it's hard to pinpoint.  Wait looking back at my initial thought process I think the correct answer is that the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1972–77) was affected because of disruptions caused by military actions from 1973 onwards but I'm not certain. Alternatively maybe none of the plans were directly affected but perhaps it's a misunderstanding.  Wait another approach: The user provided context about accessing banking services to 90% of households which is an economic goal that might have been impacted by war-related disruptions in infrastructure or investment. But again without exact details I can't be certain.  In conclusion based on my limited knowledge and the confusion around the event's specifics I'm going to provide a tentative answer: The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1972–77) was affected due to military actions disrupting its execution.  The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1972–77) in India was affected by the disruptions caused by military actions following events akin to the Indo-China War during that period.", fifth fiveyear plan 1972–77 in india was affected by disruptions caused by military actions following events akin to indochina war during that period,The Third Five-year Plan,0,0.15384615384615383,12.672020199999679,0.004500341079636108,0.0013213928037489374,0.0,0.0,0.0

The context mentions ""Transit hotel Turbaza "" which is a specific property but it doesn't give any details about its type or other hotels. Hmm this might be a bit tricky because without more information I can't really determine what type of hotel Turbaza is.  Wait maybe the question expects me to know general types of hotels rather than relying solely on the context given. Since the context only mentions one hotel perhaps it's part of a series or known for its specific type. Transit hotel sounds like it might be related to transportation or location but I'm not sure if that translates into a property type.  Alternatively maybe the question is testing my ability to recall common hotel classifications regardless of the provided context. Let me think about standard hotel types. Typically hotels can be categorized into luxury mid-range budget boutique seasonal resort and maybe even specialized ones like conference centers or eco-friendly.

Hmm so the question is about who decides how many judges there are in a high court. The context doesn't directly say that Article 9 determines the number of judges.

Context: Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume , so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals . The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids .
Question: where does the brain get its energy from

The name is based on the unenclosed condition of their seeds ( called ovules in their unfertilized state ) . The non-encased condition of their seeds stands in contrast to the seeds and ovules of flowering plants ( angiosperms ) , which are enclosed within an ovary . Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves , which are often modified to form cones , or solitary as in Yew , Torreya , Ginkgo .
Question: the seed of a gymnosperm seed is made in the
Answer: ","Okay so I have this question about gymnosperms and their seeds. Let me see if I can figure it out based on the context provided.  First I remember from the context that gymnosperms are seed-producing plants. Examples include conifers like pine trees cycads Ginkgo and gnetophytes. The term ""gymnosperm"" comes from Greek words meaning ""naked seeds "" which makes sense because their seeds aren't enclosed in an ovary like angiosperm seeds.  The context also mentions that gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves (which are often modified to form cones) or as solitary seeds such as in Yew Torreya and Ginkgo. So it's about where these seeds are located once they're mature.  Now the question is asking: ""the seed of a gymnosperm seed is made in..."" I'm trying to parse this sentence. It seems like it's asking where the seeds themselves are produced or developed. From what I know seeds are made by plants but here it's about gymnosperm seeds specifically.  Wait maybe I misread that. Let me look again: ""the seed of a gymnosperm seed is made in..."" Hmm perhaps it's phrased awkwardly. Maybe the intended question was about where these seeds develop or form. Based on the context gymnosperm seeds are not enclosed and instead can be either on cones (like scales) or as solitary seeds.  So putting that together I think the answer is related to scales or cones because those structures grow from the seed. But also considering the examples given: Yew Torreya Ginkgo all have seeds that develop on cones or are solitary. So the seed itself is made (developed) either on cones formed by scales or as solitary seeds.  Therefore I believe the answer refers to where these gymnosperm seeds are located once mature which would be on scales that form cones or as single seeds in some cases.  The seed of a gymnosperm is developed either on the surface of scales forming cones or as solitary seeds.

21,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: A subcutaneous injection is administered as a bolus into the subcutis , the layer of skin directly below the dermis and epidermis , collectively referred to as the cutis . Subcutaneous injections are highly effective in administering vaccines and medications such as insulin , morphine , diacetylmorphine and goserelin . Subcutaneous , as opposed to intravenous , injection of recreational drugs is referred to as `` skin popping '' . Subcutaneous administration may be abbreviated as SC , SQ , sub-cu , sub-Q , SubQ , or subcut . Subcut is the preferred abbreviation for patient safety .
Question: where would a subcutaneous injection be made in the skin
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where a subcutaneous injection would be made on the skin. From what I remember subcutaneous means under the skin right? The context says it's administered into the subcutis which is the layer directly below the dermis and epidermis. So that's called the cutis collectively.  Wait does ""subcutis"" refer to a specific area or just part of the cutis? I think it's referring to the deeper layers because the skin has several layers: the epidermis (the outermost layer) the dermis (the layer beneath) and then there's the subcutis which is even deeper. So when you inject something subcutaneously you go under all of that.  The context also mentions abbreviations like SC SQ etc. but the question is about where it's made on the skin. So focusing back it's into the subcutis layer. I'm pretty sure that means under the dermis and epidermis together. So the answer should be the subcutaneous layer or specifically the subcutis.  I don't think there's more specific information needed here because the question is straightforward about where to inject. So the correct spot is directly into the subcutis which is part of the cutis.  A subcutaneous injection would be made in the **subcutis** which is the layer of skin located directly below the dermis and epidermis.", subcutaneous injection would be made in subcutis which is layer of skin located directly below dermis and epidermis,"into the subcutis,[1] the layer of skin directly below the dermis and epidermis",0,0.5714285714285714,2.4790476000052877,0.0008600809588988541,0.00025253747874201744,0.0,0.0,0.0
22,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: A secondary ossification center is the area of ossification that appears after the primary ossification center has already appeared -- most of which appear during the postnatal and adolescent years . Most bones have more than one secondary ossification center . In long bones , the secondary centres appear in the epiphyses .
Question: when do primary ossification centers appear in an embryo
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the primary ossification centers appear in an embryo. The context provided mentions that a secondary ossification center appears after the primary one and both are part of the ossification process that occurs during the postnatal period and adolescent years.   Hmm but wait the context doesn't explicitly state when the primary centers appear. It just says they're present early on and lead to the appearance of secondary ones later. I remember from biology class that ossification starts in the embryo before birth. The primary centers are usually where the bones will develop their shapes.   I think the primary ossification occurs around the blastula stage which is after the fertilized egg cleaves into several cells during the early embryonic development. But wait the blastocyst forms later than that—around 8-16 cells. So maybe the primary centers are present before the blastocyst is formed? Or perhaps they're part of the process leading up to it.  Wait I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The context says secondary centers appear after the primary ones have already appeared and most do during postnatal and adolescent years. So if the question is about when the primary appears maybe it's earlier in development.   I recall that in some models of embryonic development the primary ossification occurs around the 2-cell stage or later but definitely before the blastocyst forms. The primary centers are where the notochord develops which is important for the body axes and segmentation. So these centers must form early enough so that later more specialized structures can develop.  Wait the blastocyst forms a few cells after the primary and secondary centers have already started to form. So perhaps the primary centers appear before the blastocyst stage begins. I'm not entirely sure about the exact timing but it's safe to say they're present early in embryonic development maybe around the 8-cell or later cleavage stages.  But wait is there a specific term for when this happens? Like the primary ossification centers are part of the primitive streak and primitive streak formation. The primitive streak develops from the primary germ layer and gives rise to all the major body structures. So that process starts early on so I think the primary centers form around the 8-cell stage or a bit later but definitely before the blastocyst.  I'm trying to recall if there's any specific timeline. I believe the primary ossification occurs in the early embryonic stages likely during the formation of the primitive streak which happens by around the 16-cell stage. After that comes the secondary centers which appear during the postnatal period.  The primary ossification centers form during the early embryonic development specifically during the formation of the primitive streak. This occurs around the 8 to 16-cell stage of the embryo setting the stage for later development including the appearance of secondary ossification centers during the postnatal period.

Question: who wrote there's a guy works down the chip shop lyrics
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who wrote the song ""There's a Guy Who Works Down the Chip Shop."" From what I remember this is a British rock song. I think it was part of an album or maybe even a single from the 70s. Let me try to recall any related bands or artists.  Wait I think it might be from a group called The Tornados. They were pretty popular in the UK during that time. I believe they had several hits so this song could have been one of them. If it's part of their album ""Hear Me "" which was released around 1974 then maybe the lyrics are by Kirsty MacColl and Philip Rambow.  I'm not entirely sure about the exact band members at that time but I remember Kirsty MacColl being a well-known songwriter with contributions to other songs. So it's possible that she wrote this one as part of The Tornados' collaboration.

Question: what is the weight of a honda fit
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the weight of a Honda Fit. From the context provided it mentions that there are different models under the third-generation GK series including the Honda Fit. Looking at the ""Production"" and ""Model years"" sections I see that both the Honda City and other models have similar production dates overlapping with the Fit from 2014 to present.  In the ""Body and chassis"" section each model has specific details about their engines powertrains etc. For the Honda Fit specifically under ""Powertrain "" it lists a few options:   - 1.2 L L12B i-VTEC I4 petrol - 1.3 L L13B Earth Dreams i-VTEC I4 - 1.5 L L15A I4 (petrol) - 1.5 L L15B1 I4 (petrol) - 1.5 L L15B Earth Dreams i-VTEC I4  Looking at these the 1.2L and 1.3L are petrol engines with different displacements. The more significant displacement is 1.5L for the others.  Now in terms of weight larger displacement usually means heavier cars unless other factors come into play like hybrid systems or lighter materials. However looking at the ""Powertrain"" section again I don't see any mention of a hybrid system for the Fit. Instead it lists standard petrol engines with i-VTEC technology.  Given that and since the 1.5L engine is the most common one mentioned (appearing twice) it's likely that this is the base version or the main model. Typically in cars from around 2014 onwards a 1.5L petrol engine would be more standard than larger engines.  From experience and general knowledge of Honda models around that period a typical 1.5L petrol engine car might weigh around 1170 kg (2579 lbs). However I should check the context provided again for any specific weight figures mentioned. Looking through the data I don't see exact weight figures listed in the ""Powertrain"" section.  Wait but the user asked specifically about the weight of the Honda Fit based on the given context. In the context under ""Powertrain "" there's a line: ""1.5 L i - DTEC diesel Transmission..."" Wait that doesn't make sense because earlier it says Earth Dreams with i-VTEC. Maybe I misread.  Wait no looking again:  In the Powertrain section for Honda Fit:  - 1.2 L L12B i-VTEC I4 petrol - 1.3 L L13B Earth Dreams i-VTEC I4 - 1.5 L L15A I4 (petrol) - 1.5 L L15B1 I4 (petrol) - 1.5 L L15B Earth Dreams i-VTEC I4  So all the 1.5L engines are petrol except for the first one which is also petrol but maybe a different variant.  The Curb weight section mentions ranges: ""Hybrid"" gives a range but the others don't specify. For example:  - Honda City has curb weights from 1020 kg to 1080 kg (2249 to 2381 lbs) - Honda Shuttle also in that range - Honda Freed same as City - etc.  Wait looking at ""Dimensions"" section under Powertrain it says:  Curb weight: 1 020 -- 1 080 kg for some models. So if the Fit is similar to those mentioned here its curb weight would fall into that range. However in the Powertrain details the 1.5L engines are common so perhaps the Fit's curb weight is within this range.  But wait the exact curb weights aren't directly listed for the Fit in the context provided. The closest I can get is looking at other models like Honda City and Shuttle which are around that curb weight range.  So putting it together considering the 1.5L petrol engine is standard and the curb weight ranges from 1020 to 1080 kg for similar models I can estimate that the Honda Fit's weight is approximately in that range.  The estimated curb weight of the Honda Fit based on available context and comparison with similar models is approximately **1 050 kg**.", estimated curb weight of honda fit based on available context and comparison with similar models is approximately 1050 kg,"1,020–1,080 kg",0,0.09523809523809525,7.535380200002692,0.0026593457649295078,0.0007808386729528078,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when does bloom find out who she is
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out when Bloom finds out who she is in the given context. Let me start by reading through all the provided information carefully.  Looking at each episode title and its date:  1. The first few episodes up to March 20th are about her being a witch and her past. 2. In Episode 7 titled ""I Know Who You Are"" from March 5th it mentions that she has the Dragon Flame but doesn't specify who she is yet. 3. Then in Episode 14 ""Il segreto di Bloom "" which translates to ""Bloom's Dark Secret "" on March 27th she starts exploring her past and curiosity about her identity.  So the earliest mention of her discovering her identity or her true origins is in Episode 14 from March 27th. That's when she meets a witch named Mirta who helps her understand more about herself.  Bloom discovers her identity during Episode 14 titled ""Il segreto di Bloom"" on March 27 2004.

Context: A justice of the peace ( JP ) is a judicial officer , of a lower or puisne court , elected or appointed by means of a commission ( letters patent ) to keep the peace . In past centuries the term commissioner of the peace was often used with the same meaning . Depending on the jurisdiction , such justices dispense summary justice or merely deal with local administrative applications in common law jurisdictions . Justices of the peace are appointed or elected from the citizens of the jurisdiction in which they serve , and are ( or were ) usually not required to have any formal legal education in order to qualify for the office . Some jurisdictions have varying forms of training for JPs .
Question: what is the job of justice of the peace
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what the job of a Justice of the Peace (JP) entails based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again to make sure I understand it properly.  The context says that a JP is a judicial officer in a lower or puisne court which means they're probably dealing with more specific legal matters rather than higher-level cases. They are elected or appointed by a commission (letters patent) and their main job is to keep the peace. It also mentions that historically the term ""commissioner of the peace"" was used similarly.  In common law jurisdictions JPs either dispense summary justice or handle local administrative applications. That suggests they resolve minor disputes quickly without going through formal court processes and manage everyday legal matters in their area.   The appointment or election is done by the citizens themselves in many places so they are usually selected from within the community. Interestingly it's noted that JPs don't typically require formal legal education to qualify for the position which means they might not need extensive training beyond maybe basic knowledge or experience.  Some jurisdictions have different forms of training for JPs but most don't have any formal legal education required. So their main duties are focusing on maintaining public order and handling specific legal needs locally.  Putting this all together the job of a JP seems to involve managing daily legal issues dealing with local applications enforcing peace and being elected or appointed by the community without needing extensive formal training.  The Justice of the Peace (JP) is responsible for managing daily legal matters within their jurisdiction such as resolving minor disputes and handling local administrative applications. They dispense summary justice focusing on maintaining public order. Appointed or elected by citizens they typically don't require formal legal education but may have basic knowledge or experience. Their role emphasizes enforcing peace and community service without extensive formal training.", justice of peace jp is responsible for managing daily legal matters within their jurisdiction such as resolving minor disputes and handling local administrative applications they dispense summary justice focusing on maintaining public order appointed or elected by citizens they typically dont require formal legal education but may have basic knowledge or experience their role emphasizes enforcing peace and community service without extensive formal training,"a judicial officer, of a lower or puisne court, elected or appointed by means of a commission (letters patent) to keep the peace.",0,0.14457831325301204,3.0345812999876216,0.0010597744759972471,0.00031117160708467816,0.0,0.0,0.0

Unlike Little Mo and Zoe , Lynne is aware that Zoe is in fact Kat 's daughter and helps keep the family secret until Kat reveals the truth to Zoe .
Question: who was kat slater's sisters in eastenders
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who Kat Slater's sisters are from Eastenders. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show. From what I remember the Slater family has a few siblings. There's Lynne Slater who is the eldest. Then there's her mother Maud Slater but she died in 1983.   Looking at the context provided earlier it mentions that in 2000 Lynne arrives with her father Charlie sisters Kat (Jessie Wallace) Little Mo (Kacey Ainsworth) Zoe (Michelle Ryan) and their grandmother Mo (Laila Morse). So that's four siblings: Kat Little Mo Zoe and Lynne.   But wait I think there might be more to it. Sometimes TV shows have extended families or additional relatives not always listed in the initial context. I'm trying to remember if there are any other sisters mentioned elsewhere. Oh right there's also Maud Slater who was Kat's mother but she passed away earlier.   The user is asking specifically about Kat Slater's sisters so focusing on that group: Kat (Jessie Wallace) Little Mo (Kacey Ainsworth) Zoe (Michelle Ryan) and Lynne Slater. So those are the four sisters.   I should make sure I'm not missing any others but from what I recall in Eastenders these are the main sisters. Each has their own storylines too like Zoe being involved with drug-related issues Kat dealing with her past and so on.  So putting it all together Kat's sisters would be Lynne Little Mo and Zoe Slater. That makes four siblings including herself.

Context: The Eagles headed into their bye week with the best record in the NFL ( 8 -- 1 ) , and with Wentz leading the NFL MVP discussion with an NFL - leading 23 touchdowns to 5 interceptions . During their bye , the Eagles signed former Giants offensive tackle Will Beatty and former Saints linebacker Dannell Ellerbe to not only add depth but also players with Super Bowl experiences . Coming off of the bye week , the Philadelphia Eagles entered a Sunday night showdown with the defending NFC East champion Dallas Cowboys . The Eagles came out sluggish and trailed 9 -- 7 at the half . The team exploded in the second half though , rattling off 30 unanswered points to soundly defeat their rival by a final score of 37 -- 9 . The Eagles were rolling on a nine - game winning streak after a huge blowout win over the Chicago Bears . The Eagles traveled to Seattle in Week 13 in a huge Sunday Night showdown against Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks . The Eagles struggled throughout the whole game , blowing many scoring opportunities and allowing Wilson to throw 3 touchdowns . The Eagles lost 24 -- 10 , ending their win streak . However , the Eagles bounced back in Week 14 win over the Los Angeles Rams in a tough 43 -- 35 win . However , Carson Wentz left the game in the third quarter with a knee injury . It was later found out that Wentz tore his ACL , ending his MVP caliber season . Backup Nick Foles would once again take over as starting quarterback . In Foles 's first start against the New York Giants , he would lead them back from a 20 -- 7 deficit and score 4 touchdowns and win the game 34 -- 29 . Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the Oakland Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys , and threw a touchdown and 2 interceptions in that span . Despite this , the Eagles finished 13 -- 3 and secured the top seed in the NFC . The Eagles opened as the underdogs , the first time in history that a No. 1 seed has opened up the postseason as an underdog . Despite this , Foles would lead the Eagles past the Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional Round 15 -- 10 . In the next game Foles and the Eagles annihilated the Minnesota Vikings 38 -- 7 in the NFC Championship nicknamed the Minneapolis Massacre , mocking the Minneapolis Miracle from their previous playoff victory . Foles had his best game since week 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and 3 touchdowns including an impressive flea flicker touchdown pass . This win marked the franchise 's third Super Bowl appearance and a berth in Super Bowl LII for a 2005 rematch against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots .
Question: whens the last time the patriots played the eagles
Answer: ",Alright let's tackle this question. The user is asking when the Patriots last played the Eagles. From the context provided I need to find out the most recent game between these two teams.  First I'll scan through the context for any mentions of a game between the Patriots and Eagles. Looking at the narrative there are several games mentioned:  1. The Eagles defeated the Cowboys in Week 14. 2. The Eagles lost to the Seahawks in Week 13. 3. The Eagles won against the Rams in Week 14 but later had Carson Wentz injured. 4. Nick Foles started and led them to a win over the Giants which was their first Super Bowl appearance.  Wait that doesn't sound right because the Super Bowl is usually a game between two teams from the same conference. The Patriots are Eastern Conference Eagles are NFC so they can only meet in the Super Bowl.  Looking again the last game mentioned involving both would be the Super Bowl LII where the Patriots played the Eagles. The context mentions that Foles had his best game and led the Eagles to a win against the Vikings but it also states that this was their third Super Bowl appearance and they made it to Super Bowl LII.  So putting it together the last time the Patriots played the Eagles was in the Super Bowl LII.

The series is officially known as the 2017 World Series Presented by YouTube TV . This sponsorship includes logo branding in - stadium and on official digital properties , as well as commercial inventory during Fox 's telecasts of the games .
Question: who's playing in the world series and when is it
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out who is playing in the World Series and when. Looking at the context provided it says that YouTube TV is the first-ever presenting sponsor of the World Series specifically mentioning the 2017 World Series. So the team is the Washington Nationals.  Wait but hold on. The answer I came up with initially was that the Washington Nationals are playing in the 2017 World Series from October 25 to November 5. But now thinking again if YouTube TV is the sponsor of this series does it mean they're presenting the current year's series or an older one? The context doesn't specify a different series beyond mentioning that it's the 2017 one. So maybe I should check.  No actually the first sentence mentions ""the first time MLB sold presenting sponsorships to all of its postseason series "" and YouTube TV is named as the first presenting sponsor for the World Series which is specifically identified as the 2017 edition. Therefore the answer seems correct: Washington Nationals in 2017.  But wait could there be a mix-up with the current season? For instance if this is referring to an older series maybe not the 2017 but another year. But since the context clearly states ""the World Series Presented by YouTube TV"" and it's the first time pointing towards 2017.  So I think my initial answer stands: Washington Nationals in October 2017.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who plays the evil doctor in Wonder Woman. From the context given it mentions that Princess Maru made her cinematic debut in the 2017 film ""Wonder Woman "" portrayed by Elena Anaya. But wait the question is about the evil doctor not Princess Maru.  I remember from the show or movie that there was an antagonist referred to as the ""evil doctor."" In the context of DC Extended Universe The Joker has been portrayed by Henry Cavill in some media. If this film is part of that universe maybe he plays the villain.  Alternatively I'm trying to recall if there's a specific actor mentioned for the evil doctor. Since the user provided only information about Princess Maru maybe it's not directly stated here. Perhaps the user expects knowledge beyond what was given so I might need to think based on general movie lore or previous portrayals of The Joker.  Wait in some media particularly before The Joker was played by Joaquin Phoenix and later Henry Cavill there were other actors involved. But since this context doesn't mention it maybe the answer isn't provided here. However considering it's about Wonder Woman which is a DC film likely within the Extended Universe it's probable that Henry Cavill plays The Joker as the evil doctor.

The United States (USA) has 6 Gold Great Britain (GBR) has 7 Gold Sweden (SWE) also has zero. Canada (CAN) is at 0 for all categories France (FRA) as well but there's a '*' which might mean data isn't available or perhaps they didn't participate.  So the totals are Norway with 29 Finland with 11 and then other countries have varying numbers.

Question: when did the name of bombay change to mumbai
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the name ""Bombay"" changed to ""Mumbai."" From what I remember Mumbai was originally called Bombay. I think it had something to do with a policy or a decision made by the government or some authority in India.  I recall hearing that Mumbai is an older city than Bombay but maybe the official name was changed when the name was officially adopted or registered as Mumbai after a certain year. I seem to remember it being around 1950s or 1960s perhaps 1952? Or maybe that's another change.  Wait the user provided context says in 1995 Mumbai was renamed from Bombay. But wait does that mean that before 1995 it was called Bombay and after that Mumbai? So if I'm looking for when the name changed to Mumbai it would be around 1952 or so when they officially adopted it as Mumbai.  Alternatively maybe the change happened in a different year. Let me think. Sometimes cities have been referred to by their old names even after official changes for historical reasons. So perhaps the full transition from Bombay to Mumbai happened much later like in the 1980s or so but the initial shift might have been earlier.  Wait I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to structure this. The context mentions that Mumbai was renamed in 1995 which probably refers to when it became the official name after previously being called Bombay since then. So before 1995 its name was Bombay. Therefore the change from Bombay to Mumbai happened around 1952 as per some sources I've read before.  So putting it together: When did Bombay become Mumbai?

Question: where do the royalties for winnie the pooh go
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out where the royalties from Winnie the Pooh go. From what I remember reading earlier it's about Disney and Slesinger. Let me think through this step by step.  First there was a court case in 2007 where Disney lost because they were claiming some claims against Slesinger regarding their licensing agreements. Then another case in 2009 ruled that the Slesinger family actually granted all trademark and copyright rights to Disney. But Disney still has to pay royalties for using the characters like Winnie the Pooh.  So if Disney is paying royalties now who gets those payments? Well usually when a company pays royalties they send it to the rights holder or the copyright owner. In this case since Slesinger granted the rights to Disney but Disney has to pay royalties I think those royalties go back to Slesinger. That makes sense because Slesinger is the one who originally gave them the rights.  I don't see any indication that Disney keeps the profits or sells the characters without paying them. The court rulings suggest that Selsinger retained ownership and just needs to collect fees now. So the answer should be that the royalties go back to Slesinger.

Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out where I can find information about when Barry Goldwater gave his famous speech. The context provided mentions that ""The Speech"" is considered one of the most effective ever made by a candidate and that Goldwater lost the election despite this. It also talks about Reagan winning the Governor's election in 1966 and being called ""Great Communicator.""   I need to determine where this speech took place meaning the location where Goldwater gave his speech. The context doesn't explicitly say where it was but I remember that many speeches by American politicians are given in town halls or major cities because those places can gather a large audience. Since the context mentions that ""The Speech"" is effective and that Goldwater lost the election which likely happened after he delivered the speech maybe he gave it before the election campaign started.  So putting this together I think the most probable location would be in a town hall or perhaps in Washington D.C. given that Goldwater was a U.S. Senator at that time. He might have given his speech during an election campaign event to announce his candidacy. Therefore the place where he chose his speech was likely a town hall setting.  The speech was most likely delivered in a town hall or major city location such as Washington D.C. during Goldwater's campaign to announce his candidacy.", speech was most likely delivered in town hall or major city location such as washington dc during goldwaters campaign to announce his candidacy,"part of a pre-recorded television program, Rendezvous with Destiny",0,0.0,2.311971300005098,0.0008016848087365358,0.00023539116666796258,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: Historians stress the understanding common among participants of reform as being a part of God 's plan . As a result , local churches saw their roles in society in purifying the world through the individuals to whom they could bring salvation , and through changes in the law and the creation of institutions . Interest in transforming the world was applied to mainstream political action , as temperance activists , antislavery advocates , and proponents of other variations of reform sought to implement their beliefs into national politics . While Protestant religion had previously played an important role on the American political scene , the Second Great Awakening strengthened the role it would play .
Question: what was the purpose of a revival meeting during the second great awakening
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the purpose of a revival meeting during the Second Great Awakening. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.  First the Second Great Awakening happened in the late 18th and early 19th centuries right? It was a religious movement characterized by increased spiritual awakening and revivals. Revival meetings were central to this movement. Now why did they happen?  From my history class I remember that revival meetings were gatherings where people would come together to share the gospel. The purpose was multifaceted because the movement had several goals. One main goal was to educate the public about Christian doctrine and practices. People wanted to understand what the Bible said so they could apply it to their lives.  Another important aspect was revoking sin and temptation. The idea was that by attending these meetings people would be reminded of their sins and work towards repentance. They believed that through this process they could be cleansed from the world's influences and align themselves with God.  Social reform was also a key part of the Second Great Awakening. Many revival meetings focused on addressing societal issues like moral decay poverty and inequality. By discussing these topics people aimed to bring about positive changes within their communities through better laws and institutions.  Political involvement was another element I think I've heard about. Temperance movements antislavery advocates and reformers all came together during this time. They used revival meetings as a platform to push for political changes that would reflect their beliefs. For example some groups wanted stricter alcohol laws or the abolition of slavery.  So putting it all together the purpose of a revival meeting was multifaceted: to educate on Christian doctrine and practices to revoke sin through repentance to address social issues leading to reforms and to provide a platform for political action based on their beliefs. Therefore these meetings served multiple purposes that aligned with broader goals of spiritual social and political change during the Second Great Awakening.  The purpose of a revival meeting during the Second Great Awakening was multifaceted: it aimed to educate individuals on Christian doctrine revoke sin through repentance address societal issues leading to reforms and serve as a platform for political action based on shared beliefs. These meetings contributed to broader goals of spiritual social and political change., purpose of revival meeting during second great awakening was multifaceted it aimed to educate individuals on christian doctrine revoke sin through repentance address societal issues leading to reforms and serve as platform for political action based on shared beliefs these meetings contributed to broader goals of spiritual social and political change,evangelizing,0,0.0,3.7648377000004984,0.0013144022350811352,0.0003859355599794161,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when was catch me if you can made
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when ""Catch Me If You Can"" was made based on the context provided. Let's see what information is given.  The context mentions that filming started in January 2002 but was pushed to February 7 in Los Angeles. It also talks about various locations like Burbank Downey New York City LA/Ontario airport (which doubled for Miami) Quebec City and Montreal. The film was shot in 147 locations over 52 days.  DiCaprio comments on the intense filming schedule saying some scenes took longer than expected. Filming ran from April 25 to 30 in Park Avenue just outside the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Then it moved to Orange New Jersey and returned to Brooklyn for certain scenes. There was also shooting at the TWA Flight Center at JFK International Airport and Quebec City was chosen for its European character.  The movie ended filming on May 12 in Montreal.  Wait but I need to find out when it was made not just where or how many locations were used. The start date was pushed from January to February 7. But the main shooting period is mentioned as April 25 to 30 which would be a week long followed by moving locations and ending on May 12.  So does that mean the movie started production in late January or early February? Or did filming run until May?  Looking again it says filming ran from April 25-30 then moved places. The end date is May 12. So the total shooting duration was about two weeks plus moving around but the main period was April to mid-May.  But the original start date was January 2002 pushed to February 7. So perhaps it started in January or February and finished by May.  Wait but the question is when was ""Catch Me If You Can"" made? I think I need to look for explicit dates.  In the context the start was pushed to February 7 so maybe filming began around then. It ran from April 25-30 in Park Avenue and moved elsewhere until May 12. So the movie's production spanned from January (pushed to February) to early May but the main shooting period was April-May.  I think the answer is that it was made between January 2002 and May 12 2002 as per the context.  The film ""Catch Me If You Can"" was made from January 2002 with filming pushed to February 7 and concluded on May 12 2002.   Answer: Catch me if you can was made in January 2002 with production spanning until May 12 2002.  The answer is:  Catch me if you can was made from January to May 2002.

Question: when was the first australian prime minister elected
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the first Australian Prime Minister was elected. Hmm let's see. From the context provided it lists several Prime Ministers with their terms of office and party affiliations.  Looking through each entry I notice that the first name mentioned is Sir Edmund Barton. His term starts on 1 January 1901 and ends on 24 September 1903. Since his term began in 1901 that would mean he was elected around then.   I don't see any other Prime Ministers before him listed so it's likely he was the first. Therefore the first Australian Prime Minister was Sir Edmund Barton and he was elected on January 1 1901.  The first Australian Prime Minister Sir Edmund Barton was elected on January 1 1901.  **Answer:** January 1 1901.,answer january 1 1901,1901,0,0.4,2.244268900001771,0.0007781699978125345,0.00022848673400682642,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who was on the first season of dwts
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who was on the first season of DWTS. Let's start by looking at the context provided. The context mentions several contestants with their details like their names and when they were eliminated or their status.  Looking through each line:  1. Trista Sutter is a Reality television star from ""Celebrity Notability"" and she was a Professional partner but she got eliminated on June 8 2005. 2. Louis Van Amstel is a Professional boxer; he was also eliminated on June 15 2005. 3. Edyta Sliwinska is mentioned as Eliminated 2nd on June 15 2005. 4. Rachel Hunter was a Supermodel & actress and got Eliminated 2nd on June 15 2005. 5. Jonathan Roberts was Eliminated 3rd on June 22 2005. 6. Joey McIntyre is a New Kids on the Block singer; he was Eliminated third as well but I think that's a typo because the order might be different. 7. Ashly DelGrosso was Third place on June 29 so she was in first season? 8. John O'Hurley is an Actor & game show host; Runner-up on July 6 2005. 9. Kelly Monaco is an Actress and the winner on July 6 2005.  Wait but I'm a bit confused because usually the Professional season of DWTS started in 1987 with 14 couples right? So looking at this list Trista Sutter was eliminated first then Louis Van Amstel second. Then Edyta and Rachel both Eliminated on June 15th as 2nd place which doesn't make sense because the Professional season likely had a specific order.  Wait maybe I'm mixing up the order. The context says:  - Trista Sutter was eliminated first on June 8. - Louis Van Amstel second on June 15. - Edyta and Rachel both Eliminated 2nd on June 15? That can't be right because they were in later positions.  Wait no the numbering might not correspond directly. The Professional season had a specific lineup where each eliminated position indicated their elimination order from first to last. So the first eliminated was Trista Sutter as 1st place then Louis Van Amstel as 2nd followed by Edyta and Rachel both Eliminated on June 15th but they were 3rd? That doesn't align because they can only be in one position each.  Hmm perhaps the context is from a specific season where multiple people were eliminated on the same date indicating their rankings. So if Trista was first out then Louis second followed by Edyta and Rachel both third? But that would mean four people in the top three being eliminated on June 15th.  Wait but looking back at the question: ""who was on the first season of dwts"". I know that the first season had 14 couples. The list here seems to include some names from later seasons or specific episodes. But perhaps this context is from a particular episode's recap where they listed participants and eliminations.  Looking again the first elimination was Trista Sutter on June 8 as 1st place then Louis Van Amstel on June 15th as 2nd. Then Edyta and Rachel both Eliminated 2nd on June 15th? That seems off because they can't be in two positions at once.  Wait maybe the numbering is different. Perhaps each elimination date indicated their order relative to when they were eliminated during the show's run. So Trista was first out then Louis followed by others.  But if we're looking for who was on the first season of DWTS and given that this context lists participants with their eliminations or status as Professional partners it might not directly answer who were all 14 original dancers from the first season. However based on what's provided here Trista Sutter and Louis Van Amstel are in the list.  Wait but looking at the date June 8th is the first elimination of the season so that would be the first week. Then June 15th is the second week when others were eliminated.  But perhaps the question is simpler: who was on the first season? Given that Trista Sutter and Louis Van Amstel are part of the list here but I think they might have been in later seasons as per standard DWTS info. Wait no the first season had 14 couples including TrishaLifetime's model Tammy Faye Bellerive and several others like Joey McIntyre from New Kids on the Block.  But perhaps this context is a mix-up or refers to a specific event within a season rather than the first season overall.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user provided specific details about each contestant: their names professions status (like Professional partner) and elimination dates.  Looking at the lines:  - Trista Sutter was Professional partner but got eliminated on June 8th. - Louis Van Amstel Professional boxer Eliminated 1st on June 8. Wait no that can't be right because they both were in different positions. Wait maybe ""Eliminated 1st"" refers to their order of elimination? So Trista was first eliminated as a partner?  But actually looking at the data:  Each line says something like ""[Name] [Profession or status] Eliminated x on y"".  So for Trista Sutter: Professional partner Eliminated first (1st) on June 8.  Louis Van Amstel: Professional boxer Eliminated second (2nd) on June 15.  Then Edyta and Rachel both Eliminated second on the same date? That seems confusing because they can't have two different positions as eliminated in the same spot. Maybe I'm misreading it.  Wait perhaps each elimination line is for a specific episode or week so Trista was first out on June 8th then Louis on June 15th as second place and so on.  But if that's the case then all these people were part of later seasons. Because the first season had more dancers than this context lists.  Wait but perhaps the user is asking who was on the first season based on their list here which includes some names but not all 14. So from what I see in the provided data:  The first elimination was Trista Sutter as Professional partner then Louis Van Amstel as Professional boxer on June 15th.  So perhaps these two were part of later seasons and thus the answer is none of them? But that can't be right because the question expects an answer based on this context. Alternatively maybe the first season included all the names listed here but in different orders or for different episodes.  Wait I'm getting stuck. Maybe the user wants to know who was present in the first season and from the context provided the only ones mentioned are Trista Sutter Louis Van Amstel Edyta Sliwinska Rachel Hunter etc. but perhaps all of them were part of later seasons except maybe John O'Hurley since he's an Actor & game show host who won.  Wait no the winner was Kelly Monaco so that can't be right. Wait wait on July 6th both Edyta and Rachel were Eliminated second? No looking back:  - Trista Sutter: Professional partner Eliminated first (1st) on June 8. - Louis Van Amstel: Professional boxer Eliminated second (2nd) on June 15. - Edyta Sliwinska: Eliminated second (2nd) on June 15. - Rachel Hunter: Supermodel & actress Eliminated second (2nd) on June 15.  That's four people eliminated as ""second"" on the same date. That seems conflicting because you can't be in two positions at once. So perhaps this context is incorrect or it's a typo.  Alternatively maybe each elimination number refers to their order of elimination from first place down. For example Trista was first out (1st) then Louis second (2nd) and so on with others eliminated as per their spots.  But regardless the question is about who was on the first season which had 14 original couples including some like Joey McIntyre Tammy Faye Bellerive etc. but perhaps this context doesn't list all of them. So based solely on what's provided here maybe none are from the first season.  Wait but looking at the winners: on July 6th Kelly Monaco is the winner as per one of the lines. But I think in reality Kelly was part of the later seasons or perhaps a different context.  This is getting too confusing. Maybe it's better to conclude that based on this data none of these names are from the first season because they were eliminated except possibly Joey McIntyre since he was third place but got Eliminated third as well? Wait no Joey was third in terms of elimination order?  Wait perhaps I should just list all the names provided here. But that might not be helpful.  Alternatively maybe the answer is TrishaLifetime's model Tammy Faye Bellerive because she was part of the first season but she's not listed here.  But since this context doesn't include all 14 original couples from the first season perhaps none are directly mentioned except Trista and Louis if they were in later seasons or different parts of the show.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user is asking for who was on the first season based on this data but since this data doesn't include all 14 original dancers from the first season perhaps none are directly listed here except maybe Louis Van Amstel as a Professional boxer who was eliminated second.  Wait no I think I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is that based on this context it's unclear because some of these people were in later seasons and others might not have been part of the first season at all.  Alternatively perhaps the user expects me to point out that none of the names listed here are from the first season except for John O'Hurley as an Actor & game show host who won. But wait Kelly Monaco is the winner on July 6th so she's the last one standing but maybe not part of the first season.  In conclusion perhaps I'm supposed to list all 14 names from the first season based on this data but since it's not provided here I can't do that. Alternatively since Trista Sutter and Louis Van Amstel were eliminated in the first two weeks maybe they weren't part of the first season either.  Wait perhaps the user wants me to pick out who was present in the first season based on this context. But given that all these people are either eliminated or winning/runner-up later on it's confusing.  I think I'm stuck and might have made a mistake earlier. Maybe Trista Sutter is part of the first season because she was Professional partner but got eliminated so perhaps she was present initially but then left. Similarly Louis Van Amstel as a Professional boxer would have been part of later seasons.  So maybe none are from the first season except for someone else not listed here.  Wait maybe I should just answer based on what's provided and make an educated guess that Trista Sutter and Louis Van Amstel were in the first season but got eliminated. But I'm not sure.

Over the next two years , a coalition of social reform groups and labor advocates in Boston pushed for minimum wage legislation in the state . In 1912 , Massachusetts passed the first American minimum wage legislation , which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children . Within eight years , at least thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia would pass minimum wage laws , with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women 's voluntary associations and organized labor . The United States Supreme Court of the Lochner era consistently invalidated compulsory minimum wage laws . Advocates for these minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of Muller v. Oregon , which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not . However , the Court did not extend this principle to minimum wage laws , considering the latter as interfering with the ability of employers to freely negotiate wage contracts with employees .
Question: when was the minimum wage established in the united states
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out when the minimum wage was established in the United States based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context starts by mentioning that in 1910 the Women's Trade Union League (WTLU) of Massachusetts under Elizabeth Evans and in conjunction with Florence Kelley of the National Consumer League began working on minimum wage legislation. Then over the next two years more groups joined to push for this legislation.  In 1912 Massachusetts passed its first state-specific minimum wage law. It established a commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children. The context also notes that within eight years around 1913-1920 thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia passed their own minimum wage laws. The National Consumer League was involved in pushing these laws with other organizations.  The Supreme Court cases Lochner and Muller are mentioned but they're not directly relevant to when the minimum wage was established—it's more about how these laws were upheld or challenged legally.  So focusing on the dates: Massachusetts passed its law in 1912. Then by 1913-1920 other states followed within eight years of that. Therefore the establishment period for U.S. minimum wages started around 1912 with Massachusetts and expanded up to 1920.  I should check if there's a specific year when it became nationwide or if each state passed their own laws individually during this time frame. The context says ""at least thirteen states"" by then so it was a gradual process starting in 1912.  The minimum wage in the United States was established beginning in 1912 with Massachusetts and subsequently expanded across other states up to 1913-1920.", minimum wage in united states was established beginning in 1912 with massachusetts and subsequently expanded across other states up to 19131920,1912,0,0.0909090909090909,3.1211315000109607,0.0010910650327440013,0.00032035915882326816,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: Domain names used in works of fiction have often been registered in the DNS , either by their creators or by cybersquatters attempting to profit from it . This phenomenon prompted NBC to purchase the domain name Hornymanatee.com after talk - show host Conan O'Brien spoke the name while ad - libbing on his show . O'Brien subsequently created a website based on the concept and used it as a running gag on the show .
Question: what are the parts of a domain name called
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out the parts of a domain name. The user mentioned that in the context given NBC bought a domain called ""Hornymanatee.com"" because host Conan O'Brien used that name on his show. The question is asking what the parts of a domain name are called.  First I remember that a domain name typically has different segments separated by dots. In the example it's just one segment after the dot: ""Hornymanatee"". But wait I think some domains have more than one part like ""example.com"" which is made up of ""example"" and ""com"".  So probably each part before the top-level domain (like .com) are called subdomains. Maybe there's a generic top-level domain (gTLD) at the end. Let me think: in ""Hornymanatee.com"" ""Hornymanatee"" is the main domain name and "".com"" is the top-level part.  But wait does it have more parts? If it were something like ""sub.example.co.uk"" then each part after a dot would be a subdomain. In this case there's only two parts: the registered domain and the TLD. So maybe the main name is just called the registered domain or domain name.  I think the correct terms are that each segment separated by dots is a subdomain except for the last one which is the top-level domain. But in the example given it's just ""Hornymanatee"" with "".com"" so perhaps the first part is the main domain name and the last part is the TLD.  So putting it together the parts are called the domain name (main) and the top-level domain.  The parts of a domain name include the **domain name** (the main part like ""Hornymanatee"") and the **top-level domain** (like "".com"").", parts of domain name include domain name main part like hornymanatee and toplevel domain like com,top-level domain,0,0.2222222222222222,3.1222517999995034,0.001088092324000593,0.0003194863103276384,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who starred in the movie natural born killers
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who starred in ""Natural Born Killers."" Let me start by reading through the context provided.  First looking at the poster image description it lists several actors: Woody Harrelson Juliette Lewis Robert Downey Jr. Tommy Lee Jones and Tom Sizemore. That seems like a strong list of stars for this movie.  The cast section mentions several names too: Woody Harrelson as Dr. Charles Cantor Juliette Lewis as Carolann Cantor Robert Downey Jr. Tommy Lee Jones Tom Sizemore and David Veloz as Dr. Richard ""Dick"" Emery. So that's a good portion of the main actors.  I remember that David Veloz was in this movie; he's known for roles like in ""The Usual Suspects.""

( In a later book of the series , The Tin Woodman of Oz , the woman is said to be the Witch 's servant , and it is the Witch herself who decides to enchant Nick 's axe . ) The enchanted axe chopped off his limbs , one by one . Each time he lost a limb , Ku - Klip the tinsmith replaced it with a prosthetic limb made of tin . Finally , nothing was left of him but tin . However , Ku - Klip neglected to replace his heart .

Question: who wants a heart in the wizard of oz
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who wants a heart in ""The Wizard of Oz."" Let me start by recalling what I know about the story. The Wizard of Oz is a classic tale where several characters are part of the Wonderful World of Oz.   I remember that Nick Chopper was a Tin Woodman from Oz. He's described as an ordinary man who worked as a woodcutter but was turned into tin due to some enchantment. His axe was enchanted by the Wicked Witch I think which is mentioned in the context provided.  The context talks about Nick losing his limbs one by one through prosthetic tin and eventually he becomes entirely made of tin. But something important happens regarding his heart. It mentions that Ku-Klip neglected to replace his heart so he can't love the lady he was interested in because his heart is still intact? Wait no actually when he's entirely made of tin he can't feel or love her anymore.  Wait maybe I'm mixing up the timeline here. Let me think again. So Nick Chopper is transformed into a Tin Man who loses all his limbs and then his heart too? Or was it that his heart wasn't replaced by prosthetics?  Looking back at the context: ""Once Nick Chopper was made entirely of tin he was no longer able to love the lady he had fallen for."" So it seems like when he's completely turned into tin including losing his heart. But wait in the story I know the Heartless is another character. The Heartless wanted Nick's heart but gave him a wish to return to Oz with one of Oz's Munchkins.  Wait no maybe the Heartless was someone else. Let me clarify:  In ""The Wizard of Oz "" there are several characters who have hearts that they want. The Wicked Witch of the East has a heart she wants and she makes an offer to the Heartless. The Heartless is someone with a heart of gold but is poor in Oz.  So perhaps the question is asking about Nick Chopper's desire for a heart? But according to the context given the Tin Man (Nick) can't love because he lost his heart when entirely turned into tin. So maybe the answer is that the Heartless wanted Nick's heart.  Wait but I think in the story the Wicked Witch offers her heart to the Heartless as a reward for finding the Munchkins' hearts. So perhaps the Heartless wanted the Munchkins' hearts and made a deal with the Wicked Witch to get them by offering her own heart.  But according to the context given the focus is on Nick Chopper being entirely of tin without his heart. So maybe in this specific version Nick didn't lose his heart but his limbs? Wait no the context says he lost all his limbs through prosthetics made of tin and then it's implied that he was unable to love her because his heart wasn't replaced. Or perhaps he did lose his heart.  Wait I think in some versions Nick loses his heart when he becomes entirely tin which is why he can't fall in love with the woman. But according to the given context the answer seems to be that someone (the Heartless) wants a heart from Nick because their wish requires one of Oz's Munchkins' hearts.  Wait no I'm getting confused. Let me parse the context again:  Context: Nick Chopper is a Tin Man who was made entirely of tin through prosthetics replacing his limbs. His axe was enchanted by the Wicked Witch which caused him to lose his limbs over time. The final part says that once he's all tin including losing his heart so he can't love her anymore.  But in reality in the story I know Nick didn't have a heart at first but later gained one after the Munchkins gave their hearts to the Heartless as a wish. So perhaps this context is different. The answer provided was that the Heartless wanted a heart from Nick because it's needed for their wish.  So based on this the question is who wants a heart in Oz according to the given context? It must be the Heartless.  The Heartless wanted a heart from Nick Chopper as part of their wish granted by the Wicked Witch.

Question: when did the song the joker come out
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out when ""The Joker"" came out. Let me look through the context provided.  I see a lot of information about Steve Miller Band's singles over several years. The first mention is in 1973 with two versions: one as part of the single cover for ""Fandango "" another as the B-side and ""The Joker"" on both sides? Wait actually looking closer it says ""Cover of the 1973 single Single by Steve Miller Band from the album The Joker B - side 'see track listings'."" Hmm that part is a bit confusing. Maybe I should parse each entry carefully.  Looking through all the singles listed:  - ""The Joker"" in 1973 as a single. - ""Take the Money and Run / The Joker"" live in 1983. - Reissued versions of ""The Joker"" in 1990 both regular and reissue. - Another mention: ""The Joker (live)"" in 1983.  Wait so there are at least two different releases of ""The Joker"": one from 1973 another live version from 1983 and a 1990 reissue. But the question is asking when it came out. If by ""came out"" they mean the initial release then that's 1973. Alternatively if considering all versions but typically when asked about a song's release date it refers to the first official release.  So the answer should be 1973.

The Selective Service Committee who presides over the draft procedures still have a large tumbler that holds all the number and dates that will be drawn to select candidates and the only thing that seems to have changed between the method of the past and the present one is that instead of using pieces of paper in blue capsules the SSC now uses ping pong balls with the dates and numbers on them .
Question: when did the us stop drafting for the vietnam war
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the United States stopped drafting for the Vietnam War. Let me start by recalling what I know about the draft system in the U.S.  From the context provided it mentions that the military draft method back in the 1950s and 1960s involved mixing dates and numbers randomly and drawing them to decide who would go to war. Today it's still done similarly but with ping pong balls instead of paper capsules. The Selective Service Committee (SSC) handles this process.  Now focusing on the Vietnam War which lasted from 1965 to 1975. I remember that the U.S. didn't have a draft during certain periods because of the war. Typically countries don't want their citizens in combat when they're at war so there's an exemption.  In the context given it says that the SSC still uses ping pong balls today implying the system is ongoing unless exempted. So for Vietnam the U.S. wouldn't have drafted anyone during the war years because of the exemption. Therefore the draft was suspended or stopped while the war was happening.  So the war ran from 1965 to 1975. The draft would only be in effect when it's not at war with another country. Since Vietnam was ongoing the draft must have been stopped then. Typically wars don't continue beyond a certain time frame so probably until 1975 or maybe later.  Putting this together I think the U.S. stopped drafting for the Vietnam War from 1965 onwards because they weren't at war anymore. But wait when did they stop? The exact end might be when the war ended in 1975 so the draft was stopped around then.  The United States stopped drafting for the Vietnam War starting in 1965 coinciding with the beginning of the war. The draft was suspended until after the conflict concluded in 1975.

Question: who performed the halftime show at super bowl 51
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who performed in the halftime show at Super Bowl 51. From what I remember the user provided information about Super Bowl LI which was in 2017 with Lady Gaga as the headliner. But now we're looking for Super Bowl 51 which is a few years later—specifically it took place on February 13 2017.  I'm trying to recall if I've heard about the performers for that specific game. I know that sometimes the halftime show features big names or artists with well-known songs. Lady Gaga did perform at Super Bowl LI but that was in 2017 as well not 51. Wait no actually the user said Super Bowl LI was in 2017 which is correct because that's Super Bowl LVI? Hmm I might be mixing up the numbering here.  Wait no Super Bowl LI would be the 50th game since Super Bowl I in 1967. So Super Bowl 51 would be the next one after that which was also in 2017 but later so February 13. I think the performers for that year were actually a bit different.  I believe that year featured a combination of artists rather than just one big headliner. I think it included some major pop stars and maybe some from the music industry. From what I remember the halftime show had a mix of performances by several artists to make it more dynamic.   One of the notable performers was Dua Lipa who did ""Old Town Road "" which is quite popular. There was also Maroon 5 performing another track.

Question: when was the first episode of scooby doo
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the first episode of ""Scooby Do"" was released. The context provided mentions that the gang is going to Canada in a deserted village called Bottomless Lake because a beast has scared everyone away.   Hmm but wait that's more about an episode or maybe a season? I remember that ""The Odd Couple"" and ""Scooby Do"" are both Abbott and Costello shows. The first one was ""The Odd Couple"" which came out in 1965. Then they did another series called ""Scooby Do "" but I'm not sure when the first episode was released.  I think ""Scooby Do"" started a few years after ""The Odd Couple."" Maybe around the early '70s? I recall that it ran for several seasons maybe 8 or so. So if each season is about an hour long and there were like 42 episodes in total each season probably had around 5-6 episodes.   But wait how does this relate to the context given? The context talks about a group going to Canada in a deserted village because of a beast. That sounds like it's part of ""Scooby Do "" but I don't think that gives the release date.  So perhaps I should just rely on my memory or what I can recall about when these shows started. Since ""The Odd Couple"" was 1965 and ""Scooby Do"" is another show by them maybe it's in the early '70s. Maybe around 1972? That seems familiar.  I think that's about as far back as I can remember without specific information on hand. So putting it together the first episode of ""Scooby Do"" was probably released in 1972.  The first episode of ""Scooby Do"" was released in 1972.

They subsequently won the 2017 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers , winning four games to three , earning the team , and Texas , its first World Series title .
Question: when is last time the astros won the world series
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the Astros won the World Series. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that the Astros played in the NL from 1962 to 2012. They were part of the West Division from 1969 to 1993 and the Central Division from 1994 to 2012. During their time in the NL they had one World Series in 2005 against the Chicago White Sox where they got swept in four games.  Then it says that in 2017 the Astros became the first franchise in MLB history to win a pennant in both the NL and AL. They defeated the New York Yankees in the ALCS and then won the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers winning four games to three. This was their first World Series title.  Wait so that would mean 2017 is when they won it again after 2005. So looking at the context there's no mention of any other World Series wins by the Astros beyond 2005 and this 2017 series.   So the last time was in 2017.  The Astros won the World Series for the last time in 2017 against the Los Angeles Dodgers winning four games to three.

Question: who is the speaker in shooting an elephant
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the speaker is in ""Shooting an Elephant."" From what I remember that's a story by George Orwell. The context provided mentions Moulmein and Orwell as the narrator who is a police officer during a time of intense anti-European sentiment.  Wait but the question is about ""Shooting an Elephant "" which is a different work by Orwell right? I think that story is about a hunter named Bingo who goes to Africa and faces various challenges there. In that story he ends up being shot at by a man named Jape. So the speaker in that particular story would be Jape.  But wait the context given is about Moulmein and Orwell's first-person narrative as a police officer dealing with anti-European sentiment. That seems to relate more to his other works like ""1984."" However the question specifically asks about ""Shooting an Elephant "" which I believe is a different story by him.  I should make sure I'm not confusing the stories. Let me think: ""Shooting an Elephant"" was written in 1952 and deals with themes of courage and moral ambiguity. The main character Bingo encounters various wildlife and faces situations that test his judgment. In one part Jape shoots him. So the speaker is Jape.  So putting it together the answer should be Jape.

The reverse features an engraving of the painting The Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull . Throughout the $2 bill 's pre-1929 life as a large - sized note , it was issued as a United States Note , National Bank Note , silver certificate , Treasury or `` Coin '' Note and Federal Reserve Bank Note . When U.S. currency was changed to its current size , the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note . Production went on until 1966 , when the series was discontinued . Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design . Two - dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand . This comparative scarcity in circulation , coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation , has also inspired urban legends and occasionally has created problems for people trying to use the bill to make purchases .
Question: when were 2 dollar bills stopped being made
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when two-dollar bills were stopped being made. Let me go through the context provided step by step.  First the context mentions that the $2 bill was a denomination of U.S. currency. It talks about different times it was issued before 1929 including as various types like United States Notes National Bank Notes silver certificates Treasury notes and coin notes. Then after changing to its current size in 1966 the $2 bill was only issued as a United States Note until 1966.  It then says that production went on until 1966 when the series was discontinued. After some time ten years passed which I think is from 1966 to 1976. Then in 1982 it was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design.  Wait so up until 1966 the $2 bill was being produced and used as a United States Note. After that production stopped. So the answer should be when production stopped which is 1966.

The lyrics are nostalgic talking about a past relationship affected by alcoholism and too much partying.  Looking at the question: it asks who sings the song ""It Ain't Me."" From the context it specifically mentions that Selena Gomez sings the track in a husky tone. So her voice is highlighted as part of what's notable about the song.  I don't see any other singers mentioned besides Selena and Kygo because Kygo is the DJ and producer so he might be more involved with production than singing.

Question: method used by a writer to develop a character
Answer: ","Okay so the user is asking about the method a writer uses to develop a character. Let me break this down.  First I need to look at the context they provided. It mentions several terms like anthropomorphism and the pathetic fallacy but those are about character traits or flaws rather than development methods.  The question specifically asks for how characters are developed in a story. The example given is from Romeo and Juliet where the description of April uses imagery related to winter. That's personification right? Personification gives non-human things human-like qualities.   So in the context there's another entry called ""pathetic fallacy "" which relates to projecting a character's mood onto inanimate objects or the environment. This is also about how characters are portrayed through their surroundings.  Putting it together both personification and pathetic fallacy are methods writers use. But since the question asks for the method used by a writer to develop a character I think they're referring to how the character is brought into the story—like making them real or giving them depth.  Looking at the example from Romeo and Juliet: April's description helps readers visualize her as someone with winter-like qualities like cold and strength. That's personification. It makes the character more relatable by giving her human traits through her environment.  So I should answer that the method is called ""personification."" But wait in the context it was mentioned under another term—Oedipus and Hamartia are about character flaws leading to tragic endings so maybe not directly relevant here.  Wait no the user's question is about how characters are developed. The examples given include personification (the April description) and pathetic fallacy (storm mirroring Lear's mental state). So both could be methods of development through portrayal rather than internal traits.  But since the example they provided for personification was a specific instance from Romeo and Juliet I think the intended answer is ""personification."" However considering that the question might also touch on how character moods are portrayed (pathetic fallacy) it's possible both could be answers. But in the context given the most direct method mentioned is personification.

Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out which organization is the major voice of the legal profession based on the context provided. The context mentions the National Legal Aid & Defender Association (NLADA). It says NLADA is the oldest and largest national nonprofit membership organization focused on advocating equal justice for all Americans established in 1911.  I'm thinking that since NLADA is described as being the largest it's probably the major voice. They advocate for equal justice so they must represent the interests of the legal profession. I don't recall any other major organizations mentioned here besides NLADA so I can assume that's the answer.  The National Legal Aid & Defender Association (NLADA) is the major voice of the legal profession.

Context: It was suggested that the interior of the 45 metre ( 147 ft ) wide dome should be covered with a mosaic decoration to make the most of the available light coming through the circular windows of the drum and through the lantern . Brunelleschi had proposed the vault to glimmer with resplendent gold , but his death in 1446 put an end to this project , and the walls of the dome were whitewashed . Grand Duke Cosimo I de ' Medici decided to have the dome painted with a representation of The Last Judgment . This enormous work , 3,600 metres2 ( 38 750 ft2 ) of painted surface , was started in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari and would last till 1579 . The upper portion , near the lantern , representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574 . Federico Zuccari and a number of collaborators , such as Domenico Cresti , finished the other portions : ( from top to bottom ) Choirs of Angels ; Christ , Mary and Saints ; Virtues , Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes ; and at the bottom of the cupola : Capital Sins and Hell . These frescoes are considered Zuccari 's greatest work . But the quality of the work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques . Vasari had used true fresco , while Zuccari had painted in secco . During the restoration work , which ended in 1995 , the entire pictorial cycle of The Last Judgment was photographed with specially designed equipment and all the information collected in a catalogue . All the restoration information along with reconstructed images of the frescos were stored and managed in the Thesaurus Florentinus computer system .
Question: who painted the ceiling of the florence cathedral
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out who painted the ceiling of the Florence Cathedral based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context talks about a project involving a dome decoration with mosaics and frescoes by various artists. It mentions that after Brunelleschi's death in 1446 the dome was whitewashed and later Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici decided to have the dome painted with a representation of ""The Last Judgment."" This huge work started in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari and lasted until 1579.   It also details that the upper portion near the lantern representing the 24 Elders from Apocalypse 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574. The other portions were painted by Zuccari and others like Domenico Cresti.  However the context specifically mentions that ""The Last Judgment"" was a ceiling painting but it actually refers to a fresco cycle covering much of the dome's interior. It doesn't mention any specific artist who painted just the ceiling.   Wait the initial question is about who painted the ceiling which I might have missed in the first read. The context mentions that Vasari and Zuccari worked on parts of ""The Last Judgment"" frescoes but not specifically on the ceiling alone. Since ""The Last Judgment"" was a large project covering most of the dome's interior it's possible that they painted part of the ceiling as part of this cycle.  But I don't see any specific mention of an artist solely painting the ceiling. The only painters mentioned are Vasari and Zuccari for parts of the fresco cycle. So perhaps no single artist is named for just the ceiling; instead it was part of their larger project.

Question: why does prince edward island have red sand
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out why Prince Edward Island has red sand. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context mentions that the coastline consists of various features like long beaches dunes red sandstone cliffs salt water marshes and bays. It specifically notes that the beaches dunes and sandstone cliffs are made of sedimentary rock with high iron concentration which oxidizes in the air.   Wait so if the sand is from red sandstone cliffs then it's probably because those cliffs erode over time. Red sandstone is a type of sedimentary rock that becomes eroded when exposed to ocean or coastal environments. When this rock erodes it breaks down into finer particles known as sand.  The high iron concentration in the sedimentary rock causes oxidation. Oxidation usually means the iron reacts with oxygen and moisture to form substances like rust or other minerals. This process makes the sand appear red because the minerals formed during oxidation give the sand its color. So over time these red sandstone cliffs erode into red-colored sand that can be found in places along the coast.  Looking back at Prince Edward Island which is a large island off Canada's east coast and part of Newfoundland and Labrador it has many barrier islands with dunes on their north shores. These dunes are home to birds plants and have archeological significance. The specific mention of Greenwich's dunes being significant suggests that similar features exist elsewhere.  Putting this together: the red sand is from the eroded red sandstone cliffs along Prince Edward Island. This erosion forms red-colored sediment which becomes sand after further weathering or transportation by wind and water.  The red sand on Prince Edward Island originates from the eroded red sandstone cliffs along its coastline which become weathered and transported to land resulting in the appearance of red sand due to iron oxidation.   Answer: The red sand is formed from the eroded red sandstone cliffs which oxidize over time to create a reddish color., red sand is formed from eroded red sandstone cliffs which oxidize over time to create reddish color,sedimentary rock and other material with a high iron concentration which oxidizes upon exposure to the air,0,0.125,3.4697464000055334,0.0012064173168725941,0.00035422896456604764,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: In probability theory , two events are independent , statistically independent , or stochastically independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other . Similarly , two random variables are independent if the realization of one does not affect the probability distribution of the other .
Question: when are two events said to be independent
Answer: ",Okay so I have this question about probability theory and independence between events. Hmm let me try to recall what I know. From my notes I remember that independent events are those where the occurrence of one doesn't affect the probability of the other happening. So if I flip a coin twice getting heads on the first flip doesn't change the chance of getting tails on the second flip.  Wait but how is this defined mathematically? Oh right! If two events A and B are independent then the probability of both happening together P(A ∩ B) should be equal to the product of their individual probabilities P(A) * P(B). That makes sense because if they were dependent one would affect the other's probability.  So putting it all together I think that's when two events are said to be independent. The occurrence of one doesn't influence the probability of the other and mathematically their joint probability equals the product of their individual probabilities.  Two events are said to be independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other occurring and their joint probability equals the product of their individual probabilities.,two events are said to be independent if occurrence of one does not affect probability of other occurring and their joint probability equals product of their individual probabilities,if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other,0,0.45000000000000007,1.9276296000025468,0.0006668469516365048,0.0001957999954895959,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when is the next episode of flash airing
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the next episode of ""The Flash"" is airing based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the data carefully.  Looking at the table each entry has a number (like 70 71 etc.) an episode title directed by written by original air date production code U.S. viewers in millions and some details about teleplay or collaborations.  The last few entries are from May 8 2018 up to May 22 2018. The most recent one is episode number 92 titled ""Think Fast "" which aired on May 15 2018.   Now the question asks for the next episode after that. I need to check if there's any entry after May 22 2018. Scanning through the list from entries 70 onwards up to 92 it seems like no new episodes are listed beyond number 92.   Each row represents a season or part of an episode series but looking at the numbers I notice that some have ""TBA"" for air dates and viewership which means those episodes haven't aired yet as of May 2018.  So based on this data the next episode after May 22 2018 isn't listed. Therefore there's no information provided about when the next episode will air.

Question: what is the first basic process in the light reaction of photosynthesis
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the first basic process in the light reaction of photosynthesis. Hmm from what I remember about photosynthesis it's divided into two main stages: the light reactions and the Calvin cycle (which is part of the dark reactions). The light reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.  I think the light reactions start with the absorption of light by chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs light primarily in the blue and green wavelengths which is why plants appear green. When photons hit the chlorophyll molecules they get excited and move to the electron transport chain within the thylakoids.  The first step after photon absorption should be the splitting of water. I remember something about water being split into oxygen hydrogen ions and electrons. This process is called photolysis. The energy from the photons breaks the bonds in water molecules releasing oxygen gas (O2) as a byproduct.   Wait but what exactly happens? So when light hits chlorophyll it provides energy to split water into two oxygen atoms. Each oxygen atom then becomes an O•• radical which combines with another molecule of water to form one oxygen molecule and release four hydrogen ions (H+) and electrons.  So the first basic process is definitely the splitting of water also known as photolysis. This step produces oxygen gas and provides electrons and H+ ions that are used in subsequent steps of the light reactions.  The first basic process in the light reaction of photosynthesis is the splitting of water (photolysis) which releases oxygen gas and provides electrons and hydrogen ions essential for the following steps.  Answer: The first basic process in the light reaction of photosynthesis is photolysis where water is split into oxygen and provides electrons and H+ ions., first basic process in light reaction of photosynthesis is photolysis where water is split into oxygen and provides electrons and h ions,energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centres that contain green chlorophyll pigments,0,0.16216216216216214,3.0895168999995803,0.0010680760634528856,0.0003136091240927135,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what is the longest pier in the uk
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out which pier in the UK is the longest. From the context provided it mentions that Southend Pier is the longest pleasure pier in the world and specifically in the UK. The context also states that it's over a mile long.  I remember seeing something about the Thames Estuary being significant for piers but since this context focuses on Southend Pier I should stick with that information. There might be other famous piers like Tynemouth or Harwich but according to the given data Southend Pier is explicitly stated as the longest in the UK.  I don't see any mention of another pier being longer than Southend's in this context. So unless there's additional information not provided here I can confidently say that Southend Pier holds the title based on what's written.

Question: who did cora marry in once upon a time
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who Cora married in ""Once Upon a Time."" The context provided mentions that Amy Ratcliffe from IGN gave the episode a rating of 9.5 out of 10. Hmm that's not directly helpful for determining who Cora married.  I think about what I know regarding the show. Cora is one of the main characters part of the Malum group along with Jo and Bonnie. They're involved in various conflicts like fighting against the Volsungs. But from what I recall Cora isn't married yet; she's usually portrayed as single or in relationships that are more temporary.  Wait maybe the show ended her story? Let me think. In ""Once Upon a Time "" there's an epilogue episode where things wrap up for the main characters. If Cora was married at some point before that perhaps she got married to someone else during the series. But I can't remember any names.  Alternatively maybe in one of the spin-offs or movies Cora has a romantic relationship. But since the question is about the main series ""Once Upon a Time "" I should focus on that.   I might be confusing her with another character who has married someone else. Like maybe Bonnie marries someone? No she gets engaged but doesn't end up with anyone major in the main story.  Another thought: could Cora have been involved with someone before the show ends? Perhaps a romantic relationship that's hinted at but not confirmed. But without more details it's hard to say for sure.  Since the context given is just IGN's episode rating which doesn't provide info onCor's marriage status I might have to rely on what I know up to now about ""Once Upon a Time."" Cora remains single through most of the series.  Cora remained unmarried throughout ""Once Upon a Time.""

From the context provided it says that the Muslim League was created by Khan Abdul Qayyum Khan when he split with the Council Muslim League to run for the 1970 general elections.   Hmm the question is about the location of the first session. The context mentions ""split"" and running for elections in 1970 but doesn't specify a place. Wait I remember that Muslim League was based in Britain at the time because it was formed by people escaping from Pakistan during British rule. Since the first session occurred when they decided to run for 1970 which is after their formation around then.  So if they were based in Britain before the split their first session would have been there. I think the Muslim League's initial sessions were held in London because that was a major city and center of political activity for British Muslims at that time.

Question: where is the emerald ash borer found in the us
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the emerald ash borer is found in the US based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by mentioning that the beetle is invasive in North America. The core population is in Michigan and surrounding states and provinces. Populations are more scattered outside this core area. It then goes on to specify the distribution range including places like the upper peninsula of Michigan northern Louisiana western Colorado eastern Massachusetts northern Europe where it was found in Moscow in 2003 and how it's spreading westward into Sweden from there.  Wait so focusing just on the US part. The core is Michigan and surrounding states. Then outside that it spreads to areas like the upper Michigan Louisiana north Colorado west and Massachusetts east. Northern Europe has a population but not in the US.  So putting that together the emerald ash borer is found in the US in Michigan (core) surrounding states as well as the upper part of Michigan northern Louisiana western Colorado and eastern Massachusetts.

Question: when does the champions league quarter finals start
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the Champions League Quarter-Finals started based on the given context. The context says that the draw for the quarter-finals was held on March 16 2018 at 12:00 CET.   Wait is the draw date and time related to when the matches actually start? I think in football competitions the draw usually determines the matchups but doesn't necessarily indicate the start time of the actual games. So if the quarter-finals are a stage after the round of 16 maybe each match starts once the Round of 16 is completed.  However sometimes tournaments have the Round of 16 matches happening before the Quarter-Finals on different days or even in the same day but at different times. But since the context only mentions the draw date and time I might need to make an assumption here.  If the draw was held at 12:00 CET on March 16 2018 maybe that's when the Quarter-Finals start. Alternatively sometimes matches are scheduled a few days after the draw for practical reasons like stadium availability or player preparation. But without more information it's hard to say exactly.  Wait but the user is asking specifically when the Quarter-Finals start based on the context provided. The only relevant info given is that the draw was held on March 16 at 12:00 CET. So perhaps they're implying that the Quarter-Finals begin around that time as well maybe immediately after or a few hours later.  So putting it all together I think the answer would be that theQuarter-Finals started on March 16 2018 at 12:00 CET. Alternatively if there's no specific mention of start times beyond the draw date perhaps they're using the same time slot for when matches begin.

Context: Coal power in the United States accounted for 39 % of the country 's electricity production at utility - scale facilities in 2014 , 33 % in 2015 , and 30.4 % in 2016 Coal supplied 16.5 quadrillion BTUs of primary energy to electric power plants in 2013 , which made up nearly 92 % of coal 's contribution to energy supply . Utilities buy more than 90 percent of the coal consumed in the United States .
Question: how much energy does coal produce in the us
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out how much energy coal produces in the US based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.  The context mentions that coal accounted for a certain percentage of electricity production each year from 2014 to 2016. Specifically it was 39% in 2014 33% in 2015 and 30.4% in 2016. It also states that coal supplied 16.5 quadrillion BTUs of primary energy to electric power plants in 2013 which was nearly 92% of its contribution to the overall energy supply.  Wait a minute the percentages are for electricity production not total energy supply. So maybe I need to clarify whether we're talking about energy used by the grid or the total primary energy from coal.  The key figure here is the 16.5 quadrillion BTUs supplied in 2013. That's a direct number related to coal's contribution. It says this made up nearly 92% of the country's energy supply so that would be the total energy used by all sources combined? Or just from coal?  Hmm the way it's phrased is ""Coal supplied 16.5 quadrillion BTUs ... which made up nearly 92 % of coal 's contribution to energy supply."" So I think it refers to the portion that coal contributes out of its total use.  But wait if utilities bought more than 90% of the coal consumed in the US does that mean that only about 10% is used elsewhere? Or perhaps not directly relevant here. Maybe we're focusing on the energy supplied through power plants first.  So the primary energy from coal was 16.5 quadrillion BTUs to electric power plants in 2013. Since it's nearly 92% maybe that's close enough for an approximate answer about how much energy coal produces overall?  But I'm a bit confused because the question is asking ""how much energy does coal produce in the us "" which could be interpreted as total production including all uses beyond just electricity.  Wait looking back at the context: ""Coal supplied 16.5 quadrillion BTUs ... to electric power plants in 2013."" So it's specifically about what went into power plants. Then later it says that utilities bought more than 90% of the coal consumed. Maybe this means that a significant portion is used by the grid (electricity) versus other uses like industrial processes.  But the question asks for total energy production. The context gives us 16.5 quadrillion BTUs as being supplied to power plants which was nearly 92% of coal's contribution. So if we consider that it's nearly 92% maybe the total primary energy from coal is approximately similar because ""nearly"" implies close to.  Alternatively perhaps the 16.5 quadrillion BTUs are all the energy produced by coal in 2013 as it mentions supply to power plants and their contribution. Since utilities bought over 90% of the consumed coal maybe that's the total consumption but we're looking at production.  I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to untangle this step by step.  1. In 2013 coal supplied 16.5 quadrillion BTUs to electric power plants. 2. This was nearly 92% of its contribution to the energy supply.  Does ""energy supply"" refer to total primary energy or just electricity? If it's referring to total primary energy then perhaps that number is close enough because only a small percentage might come from other uses like liquid fuel consumption elsewhere (as per utilities buying over 90%).  But the question asks for how much energy coal produces in the US. So if ""coal supplied"" refers to production which goes into power plants and maybe other places then perhaps 16.5 quadrillion is close enough as an approximate answer because it's nearly 92% of its total contribution.  Alternatively if we need a more precise figure but since no exact number beyond the primary energy is given I think using 16.5 quadrillion BTUs from 2013 would be acceptable.  Coal produced approximately 16.5 quadrillion BTUs in the US based on the context provided.

Question: who played adaline in the age of adaline
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who played Adaline in ""The Age of Adaline."" The user provided some context mentioning Blake Lively and Jennifer Larson. Hmm let me break this down.  First I know that ""The Age of Adaline"" is a film based on a series of books. It's an older movie so maybe from the early 2000s? I remember there was a casting search for the lead role because Adaline was originally played by someone else in the books.  Blake Lively is a actress known for movies like ""Mean Girls"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada."" She might have been cast as Adaline but I'm not entirely sure. Then there's Jennifer Larson; I think she had some role too perhaps supporting or maybe originally playing the character before Lively took over.  Wait actually from what I recall Jennifer Larson was indeed in a previous version of this role or maybe played another character. But she passed away recently so that might have affected her involvement. It's possible she had a minor part or wasn't the main actress but still appeared briefly.  So putting it together Blake Lively is the one who played Adaline in ""The Age of Adaline "" even though there was an original actress before her. Jennifer Larson may have had a small role that ended up being cut from the final version or had another minor part.  Blake Lively played Adaline in ""The Age of Adaline.""",blake lively played adaline in age of adaline,Blake Lively,0,0.4,2.5404257999907713,0.0008845833307012826,0.00025973187961110175,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what is the poorest county in the state of florida
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which county in Florida has the poorest economy based on the provided data. Let me start by understanding the question. The user is asking for the ""poorest"" county in Florida and they've given a context with various counties along with their per capita income numbers.  First I should identify what metrics are being used to determine poverty. Usually per capita income is a key indicator because it reflects the average income of people in an area. The lower this number the poorer the economy relative to the national average.  Looking at the context provided there's a table listing various counties in Florida along with their per capita income statistics: median county income median household income and median family income. Since the user is asking for the poorest county I should focus on these income measures.  I'll start by scanning through each county's numbers to find which one has the lowest median county income. The lower this number is compared to others the poorer the county is likely to be in terms of its economic standing.  - The first few counties listed are Collier St. Johns Martin Monroe and then Palm Beach. Palm Beach jumps out because it's at the bottom with a per capita income of $33 610.   Looking further down the list: - Sarasota is next with $33 045. - Indian River has $31 918. - Seminole follows with $29 795.  It seems like Seminole might be a strong candidate because its per capita income is significantly lower than others. But I should check if there's any county even lower than that. Scanning the rest of the list:  - Lee is at $29 445. - Nassau is much higher with $29 089. - Pinellas and Broward are also quite high.  Wait but Seminole has a per capita income of $29 795. Is there any county lower than that? Let me go through the list again to make sure I didn't miss anything.  After reviewing all counties it appears that Seminole is consistently at around $29k and others like Lee are slightly higher but not by much. The next lowest after Seminole might be St. Lucie with $23 296 but that's much lower than Seminole's 29k.  Wait no looking back I see Orange has a per capita income of $25 490 which is higher than Seminole's 29k. So Seminole seems to be the lowest among the ones listed after Indian River and Seminole.  But then again Florida's overall state per capita income is around $27k so counties below that are indeed poorer on average. However Seminole might not be the absolute lowest across all Florida but it's one of the lower ones.  Wait actually looking at the data again Seminole has a per capita income of $29 795 which is higher than some like Pinellas and Broward but much lower than others. However when comparing to other counties maybe there's another county even lower.  Wait I see that Indian River is at $31k Seminole at $29.8k and then Lee at 29.4k Nassau higher. So perhaps Seminole is the lowest among them.  But wait in the data provided Seminole's per capita income is actually lower than others like St. Johns ($36k) Martin ($35.7k) etc. but higher than counties like Pinellas and Broward which are around $41-42k.  Wait maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me check again:  Looking at the table:  Seminole: Per capita income is listed as 29 795.  Wait no actually in the data provided Seminole's per capita income is $31 062? Wait wait I might have misread earlier. Let me look carefully:  Looking at the table again:  Seminole: Per capita income is listed as 29 795.  Wait no let me check each county:  Starting from the top: - Collier: $37k - St. Johns: $36k - Martin: $35.8k - Monroe: $35.5k - Palm Beach: $33.6k (lowest so far) - Sarasota: 33 045 - Indian River: 31 918 - Seminole: 29 795 - Lee: 29 445 - Nassau: 29 089 - Pinellas: 28.7k (but higher than others) Wait hold on the numbers for Seminole are actually lower than I thought earlier.  But when looking at all counties St. Lucie has a per capita income of $23 296 which is much lower than Seminole's 29k. So maybe St. Lucie is even poorer?  Wait no in the data provided St. Lucie is actually listed with a per capita income of $23 296. But earlier I thought it was $18.7k for Levy county? Wait that can't be right.  Wait let me check each county's per capita income:  St. Johns: 36k Martin: 35.8k Monroe: 35.5k Palm Beach: 33.6k Sarasota: 33.045 Indian River: 31 918 Seminole: 29 795 Lee: 29 445 Nassau: 29 089 Pinellas: 28.7k? No wait looking back at the data:  Wait no in the table provided by the user each row has multiple columns. For example for Collier the per capita income is $37 615.  Let me parse the data correctly. Each line seems to represent a county with various metrics. The first part of each line is the median county income (per capita) then median household etc.  Wait perhaps I'm misinterpreting the columns. Let's clarify:  The table has columns labeled: Per Capita Income Median County Income Median Household Median Family. Then for each county it provides a number under Per Capita Income and another under Median County Income.  So for example Collier: $37k per capita income and median county income is also 37k? Or wait maybe the first number is per capita then median household etc. but that's unclear. Alternatively each line lists a single metric across all counties.  Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The user provided a table where each row starts with the county name followed by its per capita income (median county income) and then other metrics like median household and median family income.  So for example:  Collier: 37k St. Johns: 36k Martin: 35.8k Monroe: 35.5k Palm Beach: 33.6k Sarasota: 33 045? Wait no looking back at the data:  Wait perhaps each line lists a single metric across all counties. So for example the first line says ""Per Capita Income"" and then lists various counties with their respective numbers.  Looking again the table is structured as follows:  - The leftmost column is ""County"" followed by three metrics: Per Capita Income (median county income) Median Household Income Median Family Income. Then each row lists a county name followed by its per capita income median household and median family income.  Wait no looking at the data provided each line seems to represent a single metric across all counties not per county. For example:  - The first few lines are ""Per Capita Income"" then for each county listed under that header: e.g. Collier has 37k St. Johns 36k etc.  But looking at the data again I think it's structured such that each line represents a single metric (e.g. median per capita income) and then lists all counties with their respective numbers for that metric.  Wait no perhaps each row is a separate metric. For example:  - The first line: Per Capita Income  - Collier: 37k  - St. Johns: 36k  - Martin: 35.8k  - Monroe: 35.5k  - Palm Beach: 33.6k (lowest so far) - Then the next line is Median Household Income:  - Collier: perhaps some number etc.   Wait but looking at the data again each line seems to list all counties under a single metric. For example:  The first few lines are:  Per Capita Income Collier: $37k St. Johns: $36k Martin: $35.8k Monroe: $35.5k Palm Beach: $33.6k (lowest so far) Sarasota: perhaps higher but I need to check.  Wait no looking at the data as provided each line lists all counties with their respective metric values. So for example:  - Per Capita Income:  - Collier: 37 615  - St. Johns: 36 084  - Martin: 35 928  - Monroe: 35 661  - Palm Beach: 33 622 (lowest) - Median Household Income:  - Collier: perhaps some number  Wait no actually the data is structured such that each row represents a single metric and for each county listed under that metric. For example:  - Per Capita Income  - Collier: $37k  - St. Johns: $36k  - Martin: $35.8k  - Monroe: $35.5k  - Palm Beach: $33.6k (lowest so far) - Median Household Income:  - Same counties with their respective numbers.  Wait perhaps each line is a separate metric and under that metric the same counties are listed for all metrics. So it's a grid where each row represents a different economic measure and each column a county.  But in any case focusing on per capita income (median county income) which is likely the most relevant indicator of poverty because it reflects the average person's income in the area.  Looking through the per capita income numbers:  - Collier: 37k - St. Johns: 36k - Martin: 35.8k - Monroe: 35.5k - Palm Beach: 33.6k (lowest so far) - Sarasota: I think it's higher than others maybe around $33k. - Indian River: lower than some but higher than Palm Beach? Wait no looking at the data as provided:  Looking specifically for per capita income numbers in each county:  Palm Beach: 33.6k Sarasota: perhaps 32.5k (as per data line where Sarasota's per capita is listed after St. Johns and others) Indian River: 31 918 Seminole: 29 795 Lee: 29 445 Nassau: 29 089  So in terms of per capita income (median county) the order is:  - Seminole: $29 795 (lowest) - Lee: $29 445 - Nassau: $29 089 - Indian River: $31 918? Wait no that can't be because Indian River's per capita is higher than Seminole.  Wait perhaps I'm misreading. Looking at the data:  Sarasota's median county income is 31 457. Indian River's is 31 918. Seminole: 29 795 Lee: 29 445 Nassau: 29 089  So Seminole has the lowest per capita income among these. Then comes Lee and Nassau followed by Indian River.  Wait no because in reality the numbers are:  - Palm Beach: $33.6k (lowest) - Sarasota: higher - Indian River: 31 918? No wait according to the data provided:  Looking again at the per capita income for each county as listed in the table:  Collier: 37k St. Johns: 36k Martin: 35.8k Monroe: 35.5k Palm Beach: 33 622 (lowest) Sarasota: 31 457? Or perhaps I'm mixing up the lines.  Wait no looking at each line:  The first few lines are:  Per Capita Income  Collier: $37 615 St. Johns: $36 084 Martin: $35 928 Monroe: $35 661 Palm Beach: $33 622 (lowest) Sarasota: $31 457 Indian River: $31 918 Seminoe: $29 795 Lee: $29 445 Nassau: $29 089  Wait no that can't be because Indian River is higher than Seminole. So perhaps the per capita income for Indian River is 31k while Seminole is lower.  Then Seminole's per capita income is $29 795 which is the lowest among all counties listed here except for Palm Beach.  Wait but in reality Florida has over 60 counties and this table only lists about 60 or so. However focusing on the given data:  Seminole's per capita income is lower than Lee and Nassau who are higher up.  So based on the provided data Seminole appears to have one of the lowest median county incomes at $29 795.  Wait but looking back I think I might have misread Indian River's number. Let me check:  Looking at the line for Indian River: ""Indian River: 31 918""  Seminole is next with 29 795.  So Seminole is lower than Indian River and others listed.  Therefore based on per capita income (median county income) Seminole seems to be the poorest county in Florida according to this data.  The poorest county in Florida based on the provided per capita income data is **Seminole** with a median county income of $29 795.", poorest county in florida based on provided per capita income data is seminole with median county income of 29795,Union,0,0.0,27.20702980000351,0.009715710966325163,0.002852732787810117,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when did how you remind me come out
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out when ""How You Remind Me"" was released. From the context provided I see that it's part of the album ""Silver Side Up B - side 'Little Friend'"" which was released on August 21 2001. The question specifically asks about the release date of just the song not the entire album.   Looking through the information again under the ""Songwriter(s)"" section I don't see a direct mention of a separate release date for the song. It only states the album's release date and that it's from the ""Side"" series. Since albums typically include all songs as singles unless specified otherwise and considering Nickelback often released their major singles from their albums it's logical to assume ""How You Remind Me"" was released along with the album.  The other singles mentioned are ""Worthy to Say"" in 2000 and ""Too Bad"" in 2002. Since ""How You Remind Me"" is between those two in chronology it makes sense that it came out in 2001.

Question: in a microsoft access table what does a row of information represent
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out what a single row in a Microsoft Access table represents. From the context given earlier it mentions something about rows and columns but I need to think through this step by step.  I know that in spreadsheets like Excel each cell is part of a row and column making up a grid. Each row usually represents a record or an entity with multiple attributes. So maybe it's similar in Microsoft Access tables. If I create a table say for students the rows would probably be different students right? And columns could represent attributes like name ID etc.  So each row is essentially one student's information. That makes sense because if you have ten students you'd have ten rows each with their details. Therefore in a Microsoft Access table a single row represents one record or entity which is an instance of the data being stored.  A single row in a Microsoft Access table represents one record or entity within the database typically corresponding to a specific instance of the data it holds.

Question: once upon time in india kis film ka tag line hai
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the answer to ""once upon a time in India kis film ka tagline hai"" based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context talks about a book titled ""The Spirit of Lagaan -- The Extraordinary Story of the Creators of a Classic "" published in March 2002. It discusses the making of a film detailing the challenges faced by the crew while developing it from its concept to release.  Hmm so the question is asking for the Hindi tagline of a film that starts with ""once upon a time in India."" The context mentions Lagaan specifically because the book is about it. So I should look for any known taglines associated with Lagaan.  From what I remember Lagaan has the famous tagline ""Duniya Ki Dhaak se Chaliyenge Tere Liyan "" which translates to ""The world will run on your legs."" But wait that's in English. Since the question is in Hindi and starts with a Hindi phrase (""once upon a time in India"") I think it refers to Lagaan's traditional Hindi tagline.  Alternatively maybe the book itself doesn't provide the exact tagline but mentions that the film's making was challenging so perhaps the answer isn't directly from the context. But given that the question is about the tagline and the book is about Lagaan it's likely connected to Lagaan's tagline.  So putting it all together I think the answer should be ""Duniya Ki Dhaak se Chaliyenge Tere Liyan"" as it's a well-known Hindi tagline for Lagaan.  The tagline of the film is ""Duniya Ki Dhaak se Chaliyenge Tere Liyan.""", tagline of film is duniya ki dhaak se chaliyenge tere liyan,Lagaan (English: Taxation; also called Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India),0,0.0,3.084811399996397,0.001073657443495875,0.0003152479321948742,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who plays jimmy's mom in 8 mile
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who plays Jimmy's mom in ""8 Mile."" The user provided some context where Kim Basinger is playing the role of a character named ""Stephanie "" and it mentions that she is Jimmy and Lily's mother.   First I should check if this information is accurate. I know that ""8 Mile"" is a 2014 action thriller film directed by David Ayer. The main characters are Jimmy Barryman played by Taron Eggleton and Lily portrayed by Hannah Beachler. Their mother's role was played by Kim Basinger.  To make sure I'm not making a mistake I'll think about the movie plot briefly. It involves two brothers seeking revenge on a crime family and the story includes their mother as an important character figure who helps them navigate their way into getting revenge. Her presence is significant in the film's narrative.  Since the context provided directly states that Kim Basinger plays Stephanie who is Jimmy and Lily's mom I can confidently use this information.

Pauk advocated its use in his best - selling book How to Study in College .
Question: who invented the cornell method of note taking
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who invented the Cornell Method of note-taking. From what I remember it's a system for organizing notes that involves dividing pages into three sections. The user mentioned that Walter Pauk is associated with it. He was an educator and wrote a book called ""How to Study in College."" The Cornell Notes system was created in the 1940s by him at Cornell University.  Wait let me think again. Wasn't it designed for college students? I've heard of people using Cornell notes in classes because they're structured with the question/key words on the left and the body paragraphs on the right leaving space for cues. Yeah that's correct. So Pauk definitely came up with this system to help students study more effectively.  I don't recall any other inventors or developers for this method. It was his contribution specifically for educational purposes and he popularized it through his book which probably explained the method in detail.

Context: In 2006 , members of the film crew were honoured at a dinner event to celebrate the film 's 500th week since release . It was hosted by the Consulate General of Switzerland in Mumbai and by Switzerland Tourism . In 2010 , Yash Raj Films signed an agreement with Indian and Swiss tour companies to provide a tour package called `` YRF Enchanted Journey '' , to allow visitors to Switzerland to view filming locations used for famous Yash Raj films including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge . In 2014 , Yash Raj Films released Aditya Chopra Relives ... Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge ( As Told to Nasreen Munni Kabir ) , an attractive but expensive book about the making of the film . In response to Indian prime minister Narendra Modi quoting the line `` May the force be with you '' from the American film franchise Star Wars during a visit to the U.S. , President Barack Obama decided to quote a line from a Hindi film during his visit to India in January 2015 . He chose a line from this film , `` Senorita , bade bade deshon mein ... '' ( Miss , in large countries ... ) , and added `` you know what I mean '' .
Question: tujhe dekha toh yeh jana sanam movie name
Answer: ","Okay so the user is asking about a specific reference from the context provided. The question translates to ""tujhe dekha toh yeh jana sanam movie name"" which I think means ""You saw it; this is from a famous movie."" Looking at the context I need to find where such a quote is mentioned.  In 2015 President Obama quoted a line from a Hindi film during his visit to India. The line was ""Senorita bade bade deshon mein..."" and he added ""you know what I mean."" So that's the context we're looking for. Now I need to figure out which movie this quote comes from.  From the given information in 2014 Yash Raj Films released a book about making Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. But the specific quote by Obama is from the film ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge "" as he was quoting a line that's part of that movie's storyline.  Wait but in 2015 Obama used the quote at a time when Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge had just been released. So perhaps the user is connecting the dots between the film and the quote. The question is asking for the movie name based on this quote.   So putting it all together the context mentions that Obama quoted from ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge "" specifically using a line where he refers to large countries as deshon mein which in the context of the film might mean deshi or Indian. So the answer should be Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.

Context: The guitar , drums , and bass were recorded during a short time span during the sessions for All That You Ca n't Leave Behind , and by the time the recording of the album was finished The Edge realized that the song had been recorded so quickly he could n't remember how to play it . Because of this , the song was one of only three from the album never played live in its entirety , the other two being `` Peace on Earth '' and `` Grace '' . `` When I Look at the World '' was snippeted during one performance of `` Bad '' on the Elevation Tour in Kansas City - this is the only recorded performance of the song by U2 .
Question: when was i look at the world poem written
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when ""When I Look at the World"" was written. The context provided mentions that during the sessions for the album All That You Can't Leave Behind some songs were recorded quickly by The Edge leading him not to remember how to play them. Specifically ""When I Look at the World"" wasn't played live in its entirety and was snipped from another song called ""Bad"" on their Elevation Tour in Kansas City.  Hmm so if the album was recorded during a short time span for that session and this song is part of that album but only a snippet does that mean it's even older? Wait maybe I should look at the timeline. The album was finished after recording those sessions but ""When I Look at the World"" wasn't played live from its entirety. Snipped suggests it was taken out of another track so perhaps it's from an earlier version or a different session.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the question is about when the poem was written and the context mentions that it's snipped from ""Bad "" which might have been recorded before. If the sessions for All That You Can't Leave Behind were during a time frame leading up to September 1985 maybe the song was written earlier than that.  Alternatively perhaps the song itself was written after the sessions because The Edge couldn't remember how to play it due to being rushed. So if the album sessions happened in the late '80s ""When I Look at the World"" might have been written before those sessions or during a different period.  I'm not entirely sure but considering that it's an outtake from another song and only played as a snippet it could be that the original composition was written earlier than when the album was recorded. So maybe around 1985 or earlier.

Question: where does the white witch live in narnia
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the White Witch lives in Narnia based on the context provided. From what I remember the White Witch is a character from Neil Gaiman's ""The Problem of Susan"" which is part of his collection ""Fragile Things.""   In the story the White Witch seems like she has a home somewhere in Narnia because she mentions living there. There was an event where she went to a place called Lapith which sounds familiar—it might be a specific location within Narnia. Additionally in some versions or interpretations of Narnia lore it's suggested that many of the key characters like the White Witch actually come from our world but have adapted and exist in Narnia.  So putting this together the White Witch likely lives in Narnia itself. The context points to her having a place there because she visits Lapith which is part of Narnia. Also considering that other characters might be from our world within Narnia it makes sense that she resides there too.

Context: Luke -- Acts is an attempt to answer a theological problem , namely how the Messiah of the Jews came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church ; the answer it provides , and its central theme , is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the Jews rejected it . Luke -- Acts can be also seen as a defense of ( or `` apology '' for ) the Jesus movement addressed to the Jews : the bulk of the speeches and sermons in Acts are addressed to Jewish audiences , with the Romans serving as external arbiters on disputes concerning Jewish customs and law . On the one hand Luke portrays the Christians as a sect of the Jews , and therefore entitled to legal protection as a recognised religion ; on the other , Luke seems unclear as to the future God intends for Jews and Christians , celebrating the Jewishness of Jesus and his immediate followers while also stressing how the Jews had rejected God 's promised Messiah .
Question: who is the book of acts written to
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the book of Acts is written to. The user provided some context about Luke's ""Acts"" but it seems like there might be a bit of confusion in their question because they mention both Luke and Acts. Wait no actually the text says ""Luke -- Acts "" which probably refers to the person or work called Luke's Acts.  Looking at the context again: It mentions that Luke wrote Acts as an attempt to answer a theological problem about how the Messiah had a non-Jewish church. The answer given is that the message was sent to Gentiles because Jews rejected it. So Acts is presented as defending the Jesus movement against Jews with Luke addressing Jewish audiences.  So the question is asking who this book is written to. Based on the context it's talking about Luke's work defending or apologizing for the Jesus movement directed towards Jews. Therefore the people it's written to are the Jews. They're being defended from criticism because they rejected the movement.

Since Gómez is a Spanish name derived from Gomes I can infer that it likely carries similar meanings.

Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who started the State of the Union address. From what I remember reading earlier it's about U.S. presidents and when they gave these speeches. The context given says that every president since Woodrow Wilson did this except for Herbert Hoover. So I think Woodrow Wilson was the first one to give a State of the Union Address.  Wait but I should make sure I'm not mixing up any details. Wilson was the 26th President right? And he became president in 1913. So yes that would be early in his term when he got into office. Then each subsequent president has done this as well until Hoover who didn't give one but I think he stepped down before taking office or something.

The few color films still being made in the 2010s are of this type . The first color negative films and corresponding print films were modified versions of these films . They were introduced around 1940 but only came into wide use for commercial motion picture production in the early 1950s .

Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when color movies started coming out. The context provided mentions Kodachrome and Agfacolor from 1935 and 1936 respectively. These were the first integral tripack films which means they had three layers of different emulsion for color. It also says that these were mainly for amateur home movies and slides.

The user provided some context about Kaiser's cash reserves and their involvement in Proposition 45 but that part doesn't seem relevant here.  I remember that the name ""Kaiser"" might be related to a family or historical figure. Let me think... I believe it comes from the German name Kaiser Wilhelm which translates to ""Emperor."" So the Kaiser family has roots in Germany and other European countries.  Permanente is another part of the name. I'm not as sure about its origin.

Context: Gavin Shipman ( Mathew Horne ) - Gavin is 28 when the series starts . He is an only child , and when the series starts he still lives with his loving mother and father in Billericay , Essex . He gets on well with his parents . He works for a company called ICB and spends his spare time with his best friend Smithy ( James Corden ) along with his other friends Gary & Simon , Dirtbox , Fingers , Budgie , Swede , Chinese Alan and Jesus . He is a big fan of Tottenham Hotspur ( as is Mathew Horne ) and is often seen wearing his Spurs shirt . In the course of his job , he had to deal with a company called Bedmores , based in Barry . The Bedmores representative he had to correspond with was a woman called Stacey West ( Joanna Page ) . Gavin and Stacey had to speak regularly because of their jobs , and they found they got on very well . After months and months of talking and flirting , they agreed to meet up in London . They agreed that Gavin would bring his best friend Smithy with him , and Stacey would bring her best friend Nessa ( Ruth Jones ) with her . They met up and went clubbing . They had a great time , and got on very well . They went back to Stacey 's hotel room and had sex . The next day , Stacey had to go back to Barry , but she and Gavin promised to keep ringing each other and that this would not be the end of their relationship . While Stacey and Nessa boarded the coach back to Barry , Gavin and Smithy got a cab back to Billericay . Without waiting for Smithy , Gavin jumped in his car and drove all the way to Barry , and met Stacey when her coach pulled into the station , to her surprise . He and Stacey told each other they loved each other for the first time . Within 9 weeks , they had got engaged and married . Despite a few initial problems regarding Stacey being homesick , their relationship was successful , and Stacey became eventually pregnant . Gavin , and his father Mick ( Larry Lamb ) , often play the `` straight men '' in the series . Much of the comedy comes from the actions of those around them ( especially his mother Pam ( Alison Steadman ) and Smithy ) . It is clear that Gavin loves his friends and family very much . Despite the fact that his mother Pam often overreacts and acts without thinking , Gavin still loves her , despite being occasionally exasperated by her . His best friend Smithy is also prone to overreact , but Gavin sticks with him and loves him like a little brother . Gavin 's main personality flaw is that he is slightly spoiled , possibly due to being an only child , and reacts with irritation when he does n't get his way . He is also not particularly sensitive - he sometimes fails to understand the much more emotional Smithy and Stacey , and this occasionally puts strain on his relationship with both of them - when Stacey , who is very attached to her hometown of Barry , gets depressed and homesick upon moving to Billericay after she and Gavin marry , Gavin is more confused than concerned about this , and his responses are lacking in sensitivity about the matter . This can also be seen in the fact that Gavin is less talkative and expressive than Stacey is - while at dinner with their families after their honeymoon , Stacey is excited and full of conversation , while Gavin simply sits and listens to her . Despite all of this , Gavin loves Stacey enormously , and is very affectionate towards her , and his greatest display of love for her is when he decides to move to Barry with her despite having expressed a dislike of it previously , and he manages to get himself a new job in Wales so he can reside there . There , his boss Huw Davies and colleague Owain Hughes ( Steven Meo ) act very similar to Stacey 's uncle , Bryn ( Rob Brydon ) , talking incessantly and being over-friendly , personality traits that bewilder Gavin . Gavin is more reserved and less willing to discuss his private life than his wife . He finds it odd that Stacey is so eager and ready to spill information about their private life to Nessa , Bryn , her mother Gwen ( Melanie Walters ) and her brother Jason ( Robert Wilfort ) . When Gavin is applying for a job in Cardiff , the only people who know are Stacey and Mick .

Question: who plays stacey's mum in gavin and stacey
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who plays Stacey's mother in the show ""Gavin and Stacey."" From the context provided it mentions that in Series 3 Gavin agrees with Stacey to try having a baby but discovers she stopped taking her pill. It also says that while he is angry about Stacey not telling him the truth he becomes depressed due to his fertility issues.  Looking through the context there's mention of several characters related to Stacey and her family. It mentions that Stacey told her mother Gwen about knowing about their relationship which made Gavin annoyed because he didn't know either. Then it goes on to say that in Series 3 they try to have a baby but Stacey stopped taking the pill.  In the context provided the names of Stacey's family are mentioned: Nessa (Ruth Jones) is her best friend and then it talks about their coach going back to Barry. It also mentions that when Gavin tried to move to Wales with Stacey he found his boss Huw Davies and colleague Owain Hughes similar to Stacey's uncle Bryn.  Now looking for the part where Stacey's mother is mentioned. The context says that Gwen is Stacey's mother played by Melanie Walters. There are no other names given for family members beyond that. So the answer should be Melanie Walters as she plays Gwen who is Stacey's mum.  Stacey's mother Gwen is portrayed by Melanie Walters in ""Gavin and Stacey.""

Context: The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate , the one - mile - wide ( 1.6 km ) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean . The structure links the American city of San Francisco , California -- the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula -- to Marin County , carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait . The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco , California , and the United States . It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers .
Question: how long is the famous suspension bridge in san francisco and what is it called
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the length of the Golden Gate Bridge and its name based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The first sentence mentions that the Golden Gate Bridge spans the Golden Gate strait which is one mile wide or about 1.6 km. That's a start but it doesn't directly give the bridge's length yet.  Next it says the structure connects San Francisco to Marin County and carries both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1. Hmm not sure if that helps with the length.  Then looking for specific details about the bridge itself: ""The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols..."" Wait I'm interested in the length here. The context says it's declared a Wonder of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. Oh right! There's more information there: ""It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.""   Wait no that doesn't directly say the length. I think maybe I missed it earlier. Let me check again. The first sentence says it's a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate strait which is about 1 mile or 1.6 km wide. But does that mean the bridge itself is that long? No because bridges usually span across water but their length can be longer than just the width of the waterway.  Looking again: ""The structure links the American city... to Marin County..."" So from San Francisco to Marin County. I think Golden Gate Bridge's main span might be around 4200 feet long or so making it one of the longest suspension bridges in the world. But how do I confirm that? The context doesn't explicitly state the length but implies it's famous as a bridge over such a wide strait.  Wait maybe there's another clue. In some contexts the Golden Gate Bridge is about 4200 feet long from end to end which is approximately 1300 meters or a bit over a kilometer in one direction? No wait that seems too short because the straight-line distance of the strait is about a mile. So maybe it's more than that.  I think I remember reading that the main span of the Golden Gate Bridge is 4200 feet long which translates to roughly 1300 meters or about 0.8 miles. But how does that fit with the context? The strait itself is one mile wide so maybe the bridge's length across the water is a bit longer than that.  Wait perhaps the context doesn't provide the exact length but indicates it's famous and declared as a modern wonder. However I think there should be specific information in the provided text about its length.  Looking again: The first sentence says it spans the strait which is one mile wide or 1.6 km. So maybe that's referring to the width over the water rather than the bridge's actual length. The bridge itself must be longer than that because bridges are structures not just across a gap.  But since the context doesn't explicitly say the length in feet or meters I might have to rely on general knowledge beyond the provided text. However if only this context is available perhaps there's no direct answer about the length. But wait maybe I missed it. Let me check once more: ""The structure links..."" That part doesn't give lengths.  Wait actually in some sources the Golden Gate Bridge has a main span of 4200 feet (1300 meters) from tower to tower. So putting that together with the context I can infer that even though it spans one mile across its length is longer due to the towers and other structures.  But since the question asks for both the name of the bridge and its length I think the answer would be that the Golden Gate Bridge is about 4200 feet long.  The famous suspension bridge in San Francisco is called the Golden Gate Bridge. It spans approximately 1300 meters or 4200 feet from end to end.", famous suspension bridge in san francisco is called golden gate bridge it spans approximately 1300 meters or 4200 feet from end to end,"8,981 ft (2,737.4 m),[2] about 1.7 mi (2.7 km)",0,0.0,6.6989326999901095,0.0023615490855216376,0.0006933994361957335,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: the outer layer of the skin that contains no blood or nerve supply is the
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which part of the skin doesn't have any blood or nerve supply. The question mentions the ""outer layer"" specifically.  I remember from biology class that the skin has multiple layers. There's the epidermis which is the top layer. I think it's the thinnest and consists mostly of dead flattened keratinocytes—like dead skin cells. These cells are covered by a layer of hair called lanum or pilose.  Now about blood supply: I recall that deeper layers like the dermis have nerves and blood vessels because they're involved in sensation and temperature regulation. So if the question is asking for a layer without any of those it can't be the dermis.  The inner layers include things like fat and connective tissues. The subcutaneous tissue is right beneath the skin's surface and contains some nerves but probably not as much as the dermis or hypoderm. Wait no I think the deeper part has more nerve endings because they're responsible for detecting things like pain.  So putting it all together: the outer layer (epidermis) doesn't have any blood vessels—only the subcutaneous tissue does a bit—but definitely not nerves. So the answer should be the epidermis.

Question: what genre is the magic tree house books
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the genre of the Magic Tree House books. From the context provided it mentions that it's a ""Children's historical fantasy."" Let me see if there are any other details that might help.  The author is Mary Pope Osborne and she's known for writing children's books especially historical fiction. The illustrator is Sal Murdocca from the USA and Ayana Amako from Japan. That's interesting because it shows a multicultural influence on the book's art style which might blend different cultures into the fantasy elements.  The country listed is the United States but since Ayana Amako is from Japan maybe the books have some Japanese influences too? The language is English so that's straightforward—everyone can read it in their native tongue.

Question: rain sleet or snow that contains a high concentration of acids is called
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the answer to this question. The question is asking about what it's called when there's rain sleet or snow with a high concentration of acids. From the context provided I remember that acid rain was mentioned before. Let me go through the context again.  The context starts by defining acid rain as having elevated levels of hydrogen ions and low pH causing harmful effects on plants animals and infrastructure. It says it's caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide reacting with water in the atmosphere to form acids. Then it mentions that some governments have been trying to reduce these emissions since the 1970s with positive results.  Further down it explains more about the impacts of acid rain on forests freshwater soils etc. and even touches on human health effects. But wait the question is specifically asking for what it's called when there's high acid concentration in precipitation—rain sleet or snow.  Looking back at the context: ""acid rain"" was defined as such a phenomenon with elevated hydrogen ions. So since the question lists sleet and snow along with rain I think they're all included under the same term because acid rain can refer to any form of precipitation that's acidic not just rain. The natural sources include volcanic eruptions (sulfur dioxide) and lightning strikes (nitrogen oxides) so it's consistent.  I don't see any other terms mentioned in the context related to this specific question. There isn't something like ""acid sleet"" or ""acid snow "" but since acid rain can affect all forms of precipitation including snowfall it makes sense that the term applies broadly.

Context: An error does not count as a hit but still counts as an at bat for the batter unless , in the scorer 's judgment , the batter would have reached first base safely but one or more of the additional base ( s ) reached was the result of the fielder 's mistake . In that case , the play will be scored both as a hit ( for the number of bases the fielders should have limited the batter to ) and an error . However , if a batter is judged to have reached base solely because of a fielder 's mistake , it is scored as a `` hit on error , '' and treated the same as if the batter had been put out , hence lowering his batting average .
Question: does reaching base on an error count as an at bat
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out whether reaching base on an error counts as an at bat. From what I remember in baseball an at bat is when the batter has the first opportunity to hit the ball. But errors can complicate things.  The context provided says that an error doesn't count as a hit but still counts as an at bat unless... something about how the fielder's mistake limited the bases. If the batter reaches safely because of the fielder's error it might be considered a hit on error instead of just an out or a double play.  Wait so if the fielder makes a mistake that allows the batter to reach base without any other extra bases (like a ground ball single) then what happens? The context mentions that in some cases it's scored as a hit and an error. But if the batter reached only because of the fielder's error is it treated differently?  I think when a fielder's error results in the batter reaching base safely without any other extra bases (like a single) it's considered a ""hit on error."" This means it counts as a hit towards the batting average and also as an at bat. So even though technically there was no hit the batter did reach first base and thus has the at bat.  But I'm a bit confused because sometimes errors can result in double plays or other outcomes where more bases are scored but maybe that's when it's considered just an error without affecting the batting average as a hit. So if the error only gets to first base safely then yes it counts as a hit on error and still counts as an at bat.  Reaching base on an error can count as a hit on error which is scored as a hit (thereby counting toward the batting average) but not as an official hit. This situation occurs when the fielder's mistake allows the batter to reach first base without any other extra bases. Thus it still counts as an at bat.  Answer: Yes reaching base on an error can count as a hit on error and thus as an at bat.",yes reaching base on error can count as hit on error and thus as at bat,"counts as an at bat for the batter unless, in the scorer's judgment, the batter would have reached first base safely but one or more of the additional base(s) reached was the result of the fielder's mistake",0,0.1739130434782609,3.5696298999973806,0.0012399670290948132,0.00036407985086861933,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: The pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood to the lungs , where carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is picked up during respiration . Arteries are further divided into very fine capillaries which are extremely thin - walled . The pulmonary vein returns oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart .
Question: where does blood go when it leaves the pulmonary artery
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where blood goes after it leaves the pulmonary artery. Let me start by recalling what I know from the context provided.  The context says that the pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood to the lungs and there oxygen is picked up during respiration. Then these arteries are divided into very fine capillaries with extremely thin walls. Also the pulmonary vein returns oxygenated blood back to the left atrium of the heart.  So putting this together: when blood leaves the pulmonary artery it's coming from the right ventricle after it has delivered deoxygenated blood to the lungs. Once in the lungs carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is absorbed through the capillaries in the tissues. After that process the blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein.  Wait but does blood leave the pulmonary artery directly into something else? I think the pulmonary arteries branch off from the right ventricle go down into the lungs exchange gases and then the oxygenated blood goes back up through capillaries. Then these meet the pulmonary veins which bring it to the left atrium of the heart.  So when the question is asking where the blood goes after leaving the pulmonary artery I believe the answer is that it returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein.

Question: who were the bands in pitch perfect 3
Answer: ","Alright so I'm trying to figure out which bands were in ""Pitch Perfect 3."" From what I remember ""Pitch Perfect"" was a movie where a group of friends tried to get back into singing after a band got famous. In the first film they formed a band called The Perfect right?  Now for ""Pitch Perfect 3 "" I think the main characters might have formed their own band. Let me recall the names of each character: Taylor Jordan Alex Grant and Casey. Taylor is the lead singer I believe. So maybe her band name would include Taylor? Like Taylor's Soul but that doesn't seem right.  Wait in previous movies sometimes bands are named after other groups or just have a catchy name. Maybe it's something like The Jordan Band or The Alex Group? Hmm not sure. Alternatively the band could be called The Perfect 3 since they're part of the same series. That might make sense because each movie has a ""Perfect"" group.  Also Grant is a drummer and Casey plays guitar. They have some famous friends from the first film like the Four Tops. So maybe their band name includes that? Like The Four Tops in the Perfect 3? But I think the answer is simpler than that. Probably something along the lines of ""The Jordan Band"" since Jordan was the main singer's name.  Wait actually looking back at previous answers for similar questions sometimes it's called ""The Jordan Band."" That might be the case here too. So putting it all together their band in Pitch Perfect 3 is The Jordan Band.  The band formed by the characters in ""Pitch Perfect 3"" is **The Jordan Band**.

Question: who has the most yards per carry in nfl history
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out who has the most yards per carry in NFL history based on the context provided. Let me break this down step by step.  First looking at the context given it's talking about Emmitt Smith and his career with the Dallas Cowboys from 1990 to 2002 and then with the Arizona Cardinals from 2003 to 2004. The numbers mentioned are 4 409 yards and 18 355 carries which averages out to about 4.2 yards per carry.  Wait a second the question is asking for the most yards per carry in NFL history. So I need to check if Emmitt Smith holds that record or if someone else does. I know that rushing leaders often have high yards per carry stats especially during their prime years.   Smith had 18 355 carries over his career which is a lot. His average was 4.2 yards per carry but I'm not sure if that's the highest ever recorded. I remember hearing about other players like Emmitt Smith himself having impressive numbers but maybe he's not at the top.  Looking up some stats in my head I think Joe Montana with the San Francisco 49ers had an average of around 5.8 yards per carry during his time there. That seems higher than 4.2. Wait but maybe that was more recent and someone else has a higher number now?  Oh right there's also Walter Payton who averaged about 4.6 yards per carry for the Cleveland Browns. So 4.2 might not be the highest anymore.  But according to the context given here it specifically mentions Smith with 18 355 carries averaging 4.2. Maybe in his entire career that's the highest he had at any point but other players have higher averages over their careers. However since the question is about the most yards per carry ever perhaps someone else has a higher average.  Wait I think in recent times there might be players like Dalvin Chocolate with the Miami Dolphins who averaged around 5.1 yards per carry. That would make him the highest. So maybe Smith isn't the one with the most yards per carry overall but he's still considered one of the best.  But based solely on the information in the context provided which focuses on Smith it's possible that his 4.2 average is being highlighted as his career mark or the peak for him. However if we're looking for all-time other players might have higher averages.  Hmm I'm a bit confused now because the question asks for the most yards per carry in NFL history so maybe the answer isn't just Smith but someone else who has beaten that average. But since the context only provides information about Smith perhaps he's the one they're referring to.  Based on the provided context Emmitt Smith holds the record with an average of 4.2 yards per carry in his NFL career.

Answer: ","Alright so I'm trying to figure out who commissioned the first Christmas card in 1943. The context provided mentions that ""Santa Claus clothes"" were involved but I'm not sure how exactly that connects. Maybe it's about designing the cards or creating something related?  I know that in the early days of Christmas cards companies started producing them as a marketing tool around the 1800s and 1900s. However specifically in 1943 for Santa-themed cards... I'm not certain if there was an official commission at that time.  Wait perhaps the context is referring to a specific event or company. Maybe it's about the U.S. military or something related? Or maybe it's from a particular brand known for designing Christmas cards featuring Santa Claus.  I recall that in 1943 during World War II there were official military Christmas cards possibly commissioned by the government. If that's the case perhaps the United States Army Air Forces was involved since they had a branch called the Air Bend which did Christmas card production.   So putting it all together the commission might have come from the U.S. Army Air Forces specifically someone in charge of the Christmas cards during World War II.

And even if life smiles on him in this life , he will surely be punished in the World to Come .
Question: bible verse about honor thy mother and father
Answer: ","Okay so I need to find the Bible verse that talks about honoring one's parents. The user provided a context from somewhere maybe a religious text or a commentary. In the context given it mentions that the punishment for not honoring parents is severe leading to harsh decrees and suffering. It also says that even if someone does well now they'll be punished in the afterlife.  I know that the Bible has several passages about respecting family members especially parents. The most famous one is from Proverbs 6:1-7 which states something like ""Hear O My Son and Take thy Office; And Upon thy Hand shall I put My Favor."" That's often paraphrased as honoring your father and mother.   Wait but the user provided a context that seems to be from a specific religious tradition or book perhaps from the Talmud or Midrash since it mentions ""shechinah"" which is associated with Jewish thought about God's presence. So maybe the Bible verse they're referring to isn't exactly from Proverbs but another source.  Looking at the context again: ""the reward for honouring father and mother is very great; the punishment for transgressing it is very great."" That sounds a lot like Proverbs 6:1-7 which talks about the good that comes from honoring one's parents.   But then there's another part in the context about being separated from God (shechinah) if you afflict your parents leading to harsh decrees and suffering even if life is good now. This might be from a Midrash or Talmudic teaching rather than the King James Version Bible.  The user asked for the Bible verse so I should stick to what's in the Bible. Proverbs 6:1-7 definitely addresses this. So the answer would reference that passage.  Proverbs 6:1-7 states: ""Hear my words O My Son; Take thy office upon thine hand And upon thine hand shall I put My favor.""",proverbs 617 states hear my words o my son take thy office upon thine hand and upon thine hand shall i put my favor,Exodus 20:1–21,0,0.0,3.3930033999931766,0.0011782467993890961,0.0003459575205972745,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what was the result of the revolt of 1857
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what happened during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 which is also known as the Revolt of the Rings. I remember that it was a significant event in British history involving India. The question asks for the result of this revolt.  First I recall that the revolt was primarily led by a group called the Ringras who were Hindus. They rebelled against British rule because they wanted self-governance and freedom from colonial oppression. The revolt started around 1857 in Punjab India.  Now what happened after that? Well the British government responded with military force to put an end to the rebellion. The Indian army was part of this effort. I think the battle took place near the village of Jallianwala Bagh. It's a well-known event because it was one of the first major battles fought by an Indian army against British forces.  The result as I remember from history classes was that the revolt failed. The British successfully put an end to the insurrection and restored control over India. This victory boosted the morale of the British military but also led to increased tensions with India setting the stage for future conflicts like the First War of Independence in 1857-1858.  So putting it all together the result was that the British defeated the Indian rebels leading to the end of the revolt and control returning to the British authorities.  The result of the 1857 Indian Rebellion was the defeat by British forces at the Battle of Jallianwala Bagh leading to the restoration of colonial rule in India., result of 1857 indian rebellion was defeat by british forces at battle of jallianwala bagh leading to restoration of colonial rule in india,"led to the dissolution of the East India Company, and forced the British to reorganize the army, the financial system, and the administration in India, through the passage of the Government of India Act 1858",0,0.19999999999999998,2.791797099998803,0.0009615579225964885,0.000282333204711123,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges , where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge . Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year .
Question: where does new crust come from in sea floor spreading
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the new crust comes from at the seafloor spreading. Let me think about what I know from the context provided.  The context mentions that seafloor spreading occurs at mid-ocean ridges. There's a process where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity. That makes sense because I've heard before that volcanoes are sites of seafloor spreading and they release molten rock which forms the new crust.  Wait so if it's formed through volcanic activity then the magma from the mantle must be rising up to form this crust. The context also says that when oceanic plates diverge tensional stress causes fractures in the lithosphere. So maybe the magma is coming up from the mantle and filling these cracks.  The idea of plate tectonics ties into it too because spreading helps explain how continents drift over time. But back to the question: new crust comes from where? The context clearly states that basaltic magma rises up the fractures which then cools on the ocean floor to form the new seabed. So the source is the magma in the mantle.  Putting it all together the new crust forms from the molten rock (magma) rising from deep within the Earth's mantle and cooling at the mid-ocean ridge where spreading occurs.  The new crust is formed from molten magma rising from the Earth's mantle through fractures at mid-ocean ridges during seafloor spreading. This magma cools and solidifies to create the oceanic crust on the ocean floor.

Question: which animal on earth has the longest life span
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out which animal on Earth has the longest lifespan based on the context provided. The context mentions a Swedish man who claimed that a European eel named Ale was 155 years old when it died in 2014. If this is correct then the Ale would have been the oldest animal ever having been hatched in 1859.  Hmm so first I should consider whether this information about the eel being 155 years old is accurate or not. The fact that it's from a man who might be claiming it doesn't necessarily mean it's true. But even if it were true would the Ale really have the longest lifespan? I know that some marine creatures live for a long time because they're in environments where food and harsh conditions are constant.  But wait I remember hearing about a few animals known for having extremely long lifespans. For example some turtles can live up to 100 years or more. Then there's the dugong (or dragonfish) which can live around 67 years. But the Ale eel is said to have lived over 155 years which seems longer than many other animals I know.  So maybe the Ale eel holds the record for the longest lifespan among all animals. Even if that's a bit hard to believe because 155 years sounds quite old it might actually be true based on the information given. The context says it would have been hatched in 1859 and died in 2014 which is about 155 years later.  I should also consider if there are any other animals with longer recorded lifespans. I'm trying to think of any. Maybe some corals or sea anemones live a long time but I don't recall specific numbers for them being that high. I think the Ale might stand out because 155 years is quite significant.  Therefore based on the information provided in the context if correct the European eel Ale would have the longest lifespan among animals.  The European eel Ale if its claim of 155 years is accurate holds the record for the longest lifespan among animals., european eel ale if its claim of 155 years is accurate holds record for longest lifespan among animals,tortoise,0,0.0,3.6955863000039244,0.0012918578377195133,0.0003793160607211704,0.0,0.0,0.0

That is in contrast with a personal check , in which the bank does not debit the amount from the customer 's account until the check is deposited or cashed by the recipient .
Question: where do you get a cashiers check from
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where you can get a cashier's check from. The context provided says that when someone asks a bank for a cashier's check the bank immediately debits their account and takes responsibility for covering it. It also mentions that this is different from a personal check which isn't deducted until deposited or cashed.  Hmm so the key here is understanding what a cashier's check is. I know that both cashier's checks and personal checks are types of checks issued by banks. The main difference seems to be how they're handled once issued.   In this case when someone asks for a cashier's check from a bank the bank does two things: it immediately takes money out of their account (debit) and assumes responsibility for covering it. That means if there are any issues with the check like if the recipient doesn't deposit it or cashes it the bank is on the hook to cover those costs.  So putting this together a cashier's check must come from a bank because that's where they can issue checks that require immediate payment and have the bank handle the risks associated with them. If someone else made the check like a non-bank entity it might not be called a cashier's check but perhaps just a personal check or another type of check.  Wait no actually the context says in contrast to a personal check where the bank doesn't debit until it's deposited or cashed. So for a personal check you can write it yourself and then the recipient handles it whereas with a cashier's check the bank is doing both the issuing and covering immediately.  So the answer should relate to getting it from a bank because that's where the immediate debit and responsibility for issues come into play.

Question: where is the highest level of fluoride stored in the teeth
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the highest level of fluoride is stored in the teeth. Hmm from what I remember about fluoridation it's usually applied to toothpaste or the mouth during a visit. But sometimes people get fluoride tablets for their teeth at home.   I think that the fluoride in those tablets gets absorbed into the enamel which is the outer layer of the tooth. If that's the case then maybe the highest concentration would be there since it's right on the surface. On the other hand when you apply fluoride to the mouth or brush does all of it get distributed evenly? Or does some stay on the surface longer?  Wait I've heard that the mouth and teeth are different areas in terms of fluoride application because of the flow of saliva. When you swallow saliva moves over the tongue and through the throat which is where mouthwash goes. But teeth don't have that same circulation. So maybe fluoride from mouthwash doesn't stay as long on a tooth compared to something applied directly.  So if someone uses fluoride tablets they're ingesting it and their body distributes it into the bloodstream first before it gets into the teeth. That means when you take the fluoride via mouthwash or toothpaste some of it goes into systemic circulation rather than getting directly absorbed by the teeth.   Therefore the highest concentration in the teeth might actually come from the fluoride tablets because they're taken internally and then absorbed more directly into the enamel. Whereas external applications like mouthwash or toothpaste have a portion that ends up elsewhere not as concentrated in the teeth.  Also I think that when you take the fluoride via a tablet it gets distributed throughout the body's tissues before being available for teeth. So maybe after some time the concentration in the teeth is highest from those tablets because they're more targeted to the teeth compared to external applications which have more variability.  The highest level of fluoride storage in the teeth occurs when individuals take fluoride via fluoride tablets as this directly absorbs into the enamel (the outer layer of the tooth) and doesn't get distributed into systemic circulation. External sources like mouthwash or toothpaste may end up elsewhere within the body.

Question: in the early 1800s california society was dominated by which group
Answer: ",Alright so I'm trying to figure out what group dominated California society in the early 1800s. The context provided mentions the founding of the League of California Cities in 1898 which seems related to city government and possibly some political aspects around cities fighting corruption and coordinating strategies.  Hmm the question is about the early 1800s so that's a bit before 1898. I'm not sure if the context directly relates but maybe it gives clues about the political environment. The League of California Cities was formed to fight corruption and work on issues like electrification by coordinating city strategies. That suggests a focus on cities and perhaps business interests since electrification would involve industries.  In the early 1800s especially in California industrial growth might have been significant due to the expansion of railroad networks and the development of the state's resources. The construction of railroads was a major project that required funding and coordination among different groups. This could mean that business magnats or railroad companies were influential.  Also considering California's history with gold discoveries in the mid-1850s although that's later than 1898 it indicates an era where resource development was key. However for the early 1800s the emphasis might have been on setting up infrastructure like roads and railroads to support economic activities.  I recall that in many societies during this period the wealthy elite dominated including landowners merchants and business leaders. They would fund public projects and influence government policies through lobbying and other means. So it's likely that a group of industrialists or businessmen was the dominant force in California society during the early 1800s.  Putting it all together while I don't have explicit information from the context about the early 1800s the emphasis on city issues with organizations like the League suggests that business and industrial interests were key players. They might have been involved in initiating projects to improve cities which would tie back to their desire for infrastructure development.  So my answer is that industrialists or businessmen dominated California society in the early 1800s.  Industrialists or businessmen dominated California society in the early 1800s.,industrialists or businessmen dominated california society in early 1800s,Spanish,0,0.0,3.6393649999954505,0.0012764467272435793,0.00037479104136812043,0.0,0.0,0.0

It flows about 2,621 kilometres ( 1,629 mi ) from its headwaters in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso to its confluence with the Paraná River north of Corrientes and Resistencia .
Question: where does the paraguay river start and end
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the Paraguay River starts and ends. The context provided says that it flows about 2 621 kilometers from its headwaters in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. It then mentions that it confluences with the Paraná River north of Corrientes and Resistencia.  Wait let me read that again to make sure I get it right. The context says it runs through Brazil Bolivia Paraguay and Argentina. So starting in Brazil's Mato Grosso which is a state then flows through those other countries until it meets the Paraná River.   So putting that together the source of the Paraguay River is the headwaters in Mato Grosso Brazil. Then it flows all the way down to where it meets the Paraná River. The end point would be the confluence with the Paraná River north of Corrientes and Resistencia.  I think I got that right. So the starting point is Mato Grosso Brazil and the ending point is near the Paraná River in Argentina or Bolivia.

Question: when do we find out luke and leia are siblings
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa learn that they're siblings. Let me go through the provided context step by step.  First in the original Star Wars movie from 1977 Leia is introduced as the princess of Alderaan and a member of the Imperial Senate. She's involved in various conflicts but isn't mentioned to have any children yet.  Then moving on to The Empire Strikes Back (1980) Leia commands a Rebel base and evades Darth Vader. Here she falls in love with Han Solo but nothing about her siblings is mentioned here.  Next up is Return of the Jedi (1983). In this film it's revealed that Leia is Vader's daughter and the twin sister of Luke Skywalker. So that's where we find out they're siblings.  I should make sure there are no other mentions in the later parts like The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi because sometimes they might clarify things further but according to the context given Return of the Jedi is the key point.

Question: who wrote the original little red riding hood story
Answer: ","Alright I'm trying to figure out who originally wrote the Little Red Riding Hood story based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  Okay so it mentions that the origins of the story can be traced back to various European countries and possibly before the 17th century. It says some versions are significantly different from the one we know today.   The context also gives a couple of sources. First it's told by French peasants in the 10th century and recorded by Egbert of Liege a cathedral schoolmaster. Then in Italy it was told by peasants in the 14th century with some versions called ""La finta nonna"" or ""The False Grandmother "" written by Italo Calvino.  Additionally there's a note suggesting that this early tale might have roots in similar East Asian tales like ""Grandaunt Tiger.""

128,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: In meteorology , precipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls under gravity . The main forms of precipitation include drizzle , rain , sleet , snow , graupel and hail . Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor , so that the water condenses and `` precipitates '' . Thus , fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions , because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate . Two processes , possibly acting together , can lead to air becoming saturated : cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air . Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud . Short , intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called `` showers . ''
Question: what are the four main types of precipitation
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the four main types of precipitation based on the given context. Let me read through the context again to make sure I don't miss anything.  The context starts by defining precipitation in meteorology as any product of atmospheric water vapor that falls under gravity. Then it lists several main forms: drizzle rain sleet snow graupel and hail. It explains that precipitation happens when the air becomes saturated with water vapor causing condensation to fall.  The context mentions fog and mist aren't precipitation because they're just suspensions without enough condensation. It talks about two processes leading to saturation: cooling the air or adding more water vapor. Finally it says precipitation forms when smaller droplets coalesce in clouds and showers are short intense rains in scattered areas.  Looking at the main forms listed—drizzle rain sleet snow graupel and hail—I need to pick four of them as the primary types. From what I know drizzle is usually light rain or a steady amount with small droplets. Rain is more substantial. Sleet is ice particles falling as rain while snow is just ice crystals. Graupel can form when raindrops冻结 into冰粒 and hail comes from melting ice.  So the four main types would be drizzle rain sleet and snow.  The four main types of precipitation are:  1. Drizzle 2.

Question: when was the movie cool hand luke made
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out when the movie ""Cool Hand Luke"" was made. The user provided some context mentioning that Nashville-based Christian alternative rock band Cool Hand Luke is named after the film. Hmm wait but actually the name of the band coincides with the title of the movie? Or maybe it's just a naming nod without being directly related to the timing.  I know ""Cool Hand Luke"" is a well-known movie but I'm not exactly sure when it was released. Let me think... I recall it's an old Western or something similar. Maybe around the 70s? The band Cool Hand Luke is from Nashville and plays Christian alternative rock which might be a bit different but perhaps their music is inspired by that movie.  Wait maybe I can break it down more carefully. ""Cool Hand Luke"" was directed by Stuart Rosenberg. I think it's one of his earlier films. I'm trying to remember if it's from the late 60s or early 70s. Maybe mid-1970s? Let me see does that sound right?  Alternatively could it be from the early '80s? No that might be too long ago for a movie I associate with the band. Or perhaps it's in the late '60s to early '70s range. I think I heard it was released before 1975.  Wait another approach: the band Cool Hand Luke is a Christian alternative rock band from Nashville. Maybe their music references ""Cool Hand Luke "" but that doesn't necessarily tell me when the movie came out. However perhaps the movie was made around the same time as the band's rise or something else? But I don't think there's a direct link between the movie's release date and the band's activity.  So maybe I should just recall the movie's release year. Let me try to remember: ""Cool Hand Luke"" is an American Western film right? Directed by Stuart Rosenberg. It stars Paul Newman as a correctional officer with a drug problem who uses his influence over the inmates to get out of prison and live on the rails.  I think it came out in 1975 or maybe earlier. Let me try to visualize the timeline: The late '60s had a lot of important films but ""Cool Hand Luke"" seems like it might have been made in the early part of the 70s. So perhaps around 1973? Wait no I think it was actually released in 1975.  Wait is that right? Let me try to confirm by thinking about other films from the same director or similar time period. Stuart Rosenberg did ""The Last American Virgin"" in 1986 so he must have directed earlier films as well. Maybe ""Cool Hand Luke"" was before that. So perhaps 1975.  Wait actually I think it's 1973. Because Paul Newman often worked with Stuart Rosenberg on films from the early '70s onwards. Let me check in my mind: The movie ""Heat"" is a bit later but ""Cool Hand Luke"" might have come out earlier. Alternatively maybe it was made around 1968? That's when he starred in ""The President of the United States Is a Man."" Hmm.  I'm getting confused now. Maybe I should think about the context again: The band is named after the movie so perhaps that's more of a cultural reference than an exact date link. So without external knowledge maybe it's best to just recall based on common knowledge that ""Cool Hand Luke"" was released in 1975.  ""Cool Hand Luke "" directed by Stuart Rosenberg and featuring Paul Newman was released in 1975.

Question: what is the minimum wage in france per hour
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the minimum wage in France per hour. Let me start by going through the provided information step by step.  First I'll scan through all the countries listed to see if there's anything about France. Looking at the list I notice entries for many countries like Canada Germany Spain etc. but no entry specifically for France. Hmm that means I might have to infer or look up additional information since it's not provided here.  I remember that in the United States the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour as of 2017. However France has its own system. From what I know France uses something called ""heures de base"" to calculate overtime and other pay factors. The standard workweek is typically 39.3 hours (or 48 hours with overtime).   I think the minimum wage in France was recently updated but maybe around €10-€11 per hour as of 2023. I should check if there's any information about specific dates or changes but since it's not provided here I'll go with the general figure.  So putting it all together even though the data doesn't list France directly based on my existing knowledge the minimum wage in France per hour is approximately €10 to €11.  The minimum wage in France per hour is approximately **€10 to €11**.   Answer: The minimum wage in France per hour is approximately €10 to €11.", minimum wage in france per hour is approximately €10 to €11,€9.88 per hour.,0,0.28571428571428575,3.491163799990318,0.0012259985828888774,0.000359978427449937,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who presides over the joint sessions of parliament
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who presides over the joint sessions of parliament based on the given context. Let me start by looking at the context provided. It lists three bills that were passed in a joint session: Dowry Prohibition Bill in 1961 Banking Service Commission (Repeal) Bill in 1978 and Prevention of Terrorism Bill in 2002.  Hmm but the question is about who presides over these joint sessions. The context doesn't directly mention a current or past sitting president or prime minister so I might need to recall some general knowledge here.  I remember that in many countries like the United States and India the Prime Minister presides over joint sessions of parliament when both houses are present. However I'm not entirely sure if this is universally true for all parliaments. Let me think about other places. The UK's Prime Minister usually presides right? And in Canada it's also the Prime Minister.  Wait but the context mentions years like 1961 1978 and 2002. These could be from various countries so I need to determine which country this is referring to. If it's India then the Prime Minister presides over joint sessions when both houses are present.  So putting this together if a bill was passed in a joint session and assuming that context refers to India then the Prime Minister would be the one presiding. Alternatively maybe the President is involved in some countries. I think in the US it's the President who presides over joint sessions when the House of Representatives is present.  But since the bills were passed in a joint session without specifying which country I might need to make an assumption based on common practices. The most general answer would probably be that the Prime Minister presides unless otherwise stated but given the years listed it could also vary depending on the country's current leader.  Wait no actually when two houses meet jointly it's typically presided by the Prime Minister in many systems. So I think that's the most accurate answer based on general knowledge.  The Prime Minister presides over joint sessions of parliament when both houses are present., prime minister presides over joint sessions of parliament when both houses are present,President,0,0.0,3.7871810000069672,0.001316721857662234,0.0003866166489306396,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who sang with eternal on i wanna be the only one
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who sang with Eternal on the song ""I Wanna Be the Only One."" Let me start by recalling what I know about this song. It's a pretty well-known song from The Backstreet Boys' album ""IWantItNow "" right? But wait the question is specifically asking about who sang with Eternal on that particular track.  Hmm I think Eternal is one of the main male vocalists in the group. So maybe he's the lead singer on this song. But does he sing it alone or with someone else? I'm a bit fuzzy on that detail. I know that some songs have featured singers or backup singers contributing but which one is it for ""I Wanna Be the Only One""?  Let me try to remember the song structure. ""I Wanna Be the Only One"" is a duet between two of the Backstreet Boys isn't it? Wait no it's actually a duet with some other artist. I think it's with another male singer who provides backup vocals.  Oh right! It was featured on the song ""I Wanna Be the Only One "" and the main male singer is Eternal. But in that track he wasn't singing solo; instead he had a backing vocalist. The female vocalist for the song was probably someone like Anabel Perales who's known as Missy from The Backstreet Girls.  So putting it together: Eternal sang with the backing vocals on ""I Wanna Be the Only One "" and his partner was Missy Perales. That makes sense because I remember hearing that the track had both male and female vocals contributing.  Eternal sang with a backing vocalist named Anabel Perales (Missy) on ""I Wanna Be the Only One.""

Question: what is an international system in international relations
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what an international system is within international relations based on the context given about the Union of South American Nations (UNASOM). Let me start by recalling what I know about international systems.   I remember that in international relations there are different types of systems like military or political. But here it's asking specifically about an ""international system."" From my studies I think this refers to a framework where multiple states interact with each other based on certain rules and norms.  Wait the context mentions UNASOM. What do I know about that? Oh right it was a union formed by South American countries to promote unity in response to external threats like the Cold War. This shows that international systems involve cooperation among nations under specific agreements or rules.  So putting this together an international system probably refers to the set of rules norms and institutions that govern how states interact globally. It includes things like treaties UN Charter and various summits where countries meet to discuss global issues.   I should make sure I'm not confusing it with other systems. For example sometimes people talk about military alliances or trade blocs but those are different because they're more focused on specific areas. The international system in international relations is broader covering everything from diplomacy to economics.  So based on the context of UNASOM and what I know about how states interact under rules like the UN Charter I can conclude that an international system involves the collective behaviors and agreements among nations to manage global affairs.  An international system refers to the framework of rules norms and institutions that govern the interactions among states in international relations.

Context: A diastema ( plural diastemata ) is a space or gap between two teeth . Many species of mammals have diastemata as a normal feature , most commonly between the incisors and molars . Diastemata are common for children and can exist in adult teeth as well . Diastemata are primarily caused by imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of teeth . If the labial frenulum ( lip tissue ) pulls , it can also push the teeth apart and cause a diastema between the center of the two front teeth .
Question: what is the name of the gap between two front teeth
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what the name of the gap between two front teeth is. Let's see from the context given earlier about diastemas... Hmm diastema refers to a space or gap between two teeth. The context mentions that many mammals have diastemata normally between incisors and molars. Wait but we're specifically talking about front teeth here.  The question is asking for the name of this specific gap between front teeth. So in mammals the front teeth are typically the incisors. The context says diastemata are common in children and can exist in adult teeth too. It also mentions that these gaps can be caused by an imbalance in jaw relationship or the labial frenulum pulling which pushes the teeth apart.  So putting it all together since the gap is between two front teeth (incisors) and the term used for any such gap is diastema then specifically between incisors and molars? Wait no because incisors are front teeth. Maybe I'm confusing molars with the front ones. Let me clarify: in mammals including humans the primary teeth are incisors on the front followed by molars.  Wait but when talking about diastema it's between two teeth and often mentioned as being between incisors and molars. So maybe that refers to a gap caused between an incisor and a molar? But in this case the question is specifically about the gap between two front teeth which are both incisors.  Wait no actually diastema can occur between any two adjacent teeth where they could potentially space apart. In mammals it's commonly between incisors (front) and molars because those are often more prominent. But for front teeth themselves maybe there isn't a specific term like ""diastema "" but the general term is still ""diastema.""  Alternatively perhaps the correct answer is ""dental diastema"" or something else but from the context given it's just referred to as a diastema. So in this case since the gap is between two front teeth (incisors) and diastema applies generally I think the term would still be diastema.  Wait maybe there's a more specific term for gaps between incisors? But from what the context says it doesn't mention anything else besides diastema. So unless another term is introduced in the context which isn't included here the answer should stick with diastema.

Question: how many steps does the cn tower have
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out how many steps the CN Tower has. The question is asking for that number but looking at the context provided it's a bit tricky because the information given isn't directly about the CN Tower. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by talking about a metal staircase that reaches the main deck level after 1 776 steps and then goes up to SkyPod 100 meters above with 2 579 steps. It mentions this staircase is the tallest metal staircase on Earth but clarifies it's intended for emergency use only and not open to the public except twice a year for charity stair-climb events.  Then there are details about climbing records—Brendan Keenoy climbing in 7 minutes and 52 seconds and Jeff Adams using a wheelchair. It also mentions that originally these stairs were on one side of the tower facing north with glass views but were later moved inside the core after being replaced by another elevator pair.  Wait a minute the context is about a staircase at Skyline Towers in Toronto which I think is actually the CN Tower. I remember that the CN Tower has multiple staircases for different purposes. So perhaps the numbers given are from one of its staircases.  The first number mentioned is 1 776 steps to reach main deck level. The second staircase goes up to SkyPod with 2 579 steps. But the question is asking about how many steps the CN Tower has. I'm a bit confused because in reality the CN Tower doesn't have just one staircase; it has several. There's the SkyPod which requires climbing approximately 1 800 steps to get there from ground level or around 2 579 steps for the full height.  Wait no—the context says that after 1 776 steps they reach the main deck level and then another staircase takes them up to SkyPod at 328 feet (which I think is 100 meters) with 2 579 steps. But when looking it up I know the CN Tower has a total of about 3 150 steps for its full height. So maybe in this context they're referring to one specific staircase that goes up partway.  But since the question is asking how many steps the CN Tower has which typically refers to the main stairwell it's around 3 176 steps from ground level to the top of the SkyPod (which is about 340 meters). However in this context they mention two different staircases: one with 1 776 steps to main deck and another with 2 579 to SkyPod. So perhaps the CN Tower has at least two staircases but the question is asking for the total number of steps it has.  Wait no—the way the context is structured might be talking about a specific staircase inside the tower that goes up after already being moved into the core. The original staircase was on one side with glass views but was later replaced by an elevator and moved inside. So maybe this staircase that's now windowless and inside has 2 579 steps to SkyPod.  But I'm not sure if the context is accurate or if it's mixing information about different parts of the tower. It might be best to stick with known facts. The CN Tower's main stairwell from ground level to the top (which goes up around 340 meters) has approximately 1 800 steps for some people and more than that for others.  However looking at the context again it says ""the metal staircase reaches the main deck level after 1 776 steps"" and then SkyPod after 2 579. So maybe this is referring to two different staircases: one from ground to main deck (1 776) and another inside from that point up to SkyPod (another 803 steps). But since the question is about how many steps the CN Tower has in total perhaps it's asking for the number of steps for the entire tower.  But I think the answer might be based on a staircase within the tower. The context mentions that these stairs were moved inside after being replaced by another elevator pair so maybe this specific staircase now has 2 579 steps to SkyPod. But in reality the CN Tower's main stairwell from ground level is about 3 176 steps for a full ascent.  Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The question might be referring to one of the staircases mentioned in the context. So if they climbed after moving into core and used 2 579 steps to get to SkyPod maybe that's how many steps the staircase has now but I think the actual total number is higher.  Alternatively perhaps the answer refers to the first part: reaching main deck level with 1 776 steps. But in reality climbing from ground to main deck (which is around floor 25) only takes about a thousand steps so that might not be accurate.  Wait maybe I should check my facts again. The CN Tower has two staircases: one on the southern side and another inside. The northern staircase was moved into the core in 1986 and has about 3 000 steps total to reach the top of the SkyPod (340 meters). So maybe the answer is around 3 000 or so.  But according to the context provided after moving the original stairs inside they take another 2 579 steps to get to SkyPod. So perhaps that's the number for this particular staircase within the tower now.  The CN Tower has approximately 2 579 steps on its current windowless stairwell from the main deck level to SkyPod at around 340 meters height.

Question: what is the meaning of gorakh dhanda in urdu
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out how to answer this question about ""gorakh dhanda"" in Urdu. Let me start by recalling any information I have on the word. From the context provided it says that Naz Khialvi was awarded the ""Excellence in Radio Compering Award"" in 2000. Hmm but that doesn't directly relate to ""gorakh dhanda."" Maybe I need to connect this award somehow?  Wait maybe ""gorakh dhanda"" is a term related to radio or perhaps a specific award given to Naz Khialvi? The word ""dhanda"" sounds like it could be part of an award name. But in Urdu awards are usually named after notable figures or concepts.  Let me think about the meaning of ""gorakhat."" I believe it refers to a mountain peak in Pakistan and India—Gorak hatred in the region. So perhaps ""gorakh dhanda"" is an award? If Naz Khialvi won this award in 2000 maybe it's related to journalism or radio.  Wait the user asked about the meaning of ""gorakh dhanda"" in Urdu. Since I don't have direct knowledge of its translation from English I'll need to look up its Urdu equivalent. From what I remember ""dhanda"" can mean a type of dance like Bharatanatyam but that might not be relevant here.  Alternatively considering the award context and the fact that it's called ""Excellence in Radio Compering "" maybe ""gorakh dhanda"" is an award given to recognize excellence in radio journalism. So perhaps the Urdu term for this award would involve words related to recognition or honor in the radio field.  But since I can't be certain I'll go with my initial thought that ""dhanda"" might refer to a dance so putting it all together: Gorakh is the mountain peak and dhanda could mean dance. So maybe the Urdu term is ""gorakhati dance."" But I'm not entirely sure if this is correct.  Alternatively perhaps ""gorakh dhanda"" translates to something else in Urdu related to awards or recognition. Maybe I should check a reliable Urdu dictionary or translation tool for an accurate meaning.  The Urdu equivalent of ""gorakh dhanda"" could be interpreted as **gorakhati舞蹈**. This term combines the mountain peak Gorakhat with the concept of dance suggesting it might relate to an award in the radio field honoring excellence in journalism.

Question: votes required to pass a bill in indian parliament
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out what the question is asking. The user provided some context about Jammu and Kashmir's federal status and related legal provisions but wants me to answer about the votes needed to pass a bill in the Indian Parliament.  Hmm first I remember that in India the Parliament has two houses: the Lok Sabha (Lower House) and the Rajya Sabha (Upper House). Each has its own majority required for bills.   Wait in the Lok Sabha which is the Lower House a bill usually requires two-thirds of the total votes. But this can change if certain conditions are met like urgency or with certain members. For example 273 members make up 60% of the total 450 seats so that's the threshold for passing a bill without any exceptions.  Then there's the Rajya Sabha which is the Upper House. They require one-third majority to pass a bill. So they need 1/3rd of 200 members which would be around 67 votes or more.  I should make sure I'm not mixing up the numbers. Sometimes especially in times of urgency the threshold can drop even below two-thirds in Lok Sabha but under normal circumstances it's definitely two-thirds there.  So putting it all together: for a bill to pass in the Indian Parliament in Lok Sabha you need two-thirds majority (273 votes) and in Rajya Sabha one-third majority (67 votes). That seems right based on what I remember from previous studies.

Question: all time highest goal scorer in spain national team
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the all-time highest goal scorer for the Spain national team based on the provided context. Let me look at the data given.  First I see a list of players with their career stats. Each entry includes the player's name start year end year caps (number of games played) goals and average goals per game.   Looking through each player:  1. David Villa: He has 59 goals across his career. 2. Raúl: With 44 goals. 3. Fernando Torres: 38 goals. 4. David Silva: 35 goals. 5. Fernando Hierro: 29 goals. 6. Fernando Morientes: 89 goals which seems higher than the others so far. 7. Emilio Butragueño: 69 goals. 8. Alfredo Di Stéfano: 31 goals. 9. Julio Salinas: 56 goals. 10. Míchel: 66 goals.  Wait a minute Fernando Morientes has the highest number of goals listed here with 89. So he must be the top scorer. But I should make sure there aren't any other players mentioned elsewhere that are not in this list who might have more goals. The context provided only includes these ten players so based on this data alone Fernando Morientes is the highest.  The all-time highest goal scorer for Spain's national team based on the provided context is **Fernando Morientes** with 89 goals., alltime highest goal scorer for spains national team based on provided context is fernando morientes with 89 goals,David Villa,0,0.0,2.7397223000007216,0.0009437826257513612,0.00027711401156108923,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when was the last time minnesota vikings was in the super bowl
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out when the Minnesota Vikings were in the Super Bowl based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again.  It mentions that since the team's first season in 1961 they have had one of the highest winning percentages in the NFL. As of 2017 they've won at least three games every season except 1962 and are among six teams with at least 15 wins per regular season.  They won an NFL Championship in 1969 before the league merger with the AFL. After that from 1970 onwards they qualified for the playoffs 27 times which is third-most in the league.  The team has played in Super Bowls IV VIII IX and XI. It also notes they didn't win any of those Super Bowls. Additionally they lost in their last six NFC Championship Game appearances since 1978.  They currently have 14 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  So focusing on the Super Bowl appearances: IV (1969) VIII (1972?) wait no let me check the numbers. Wait the Super Bowls they played in are listed as IV VIII IX and XI.  IV was 1969 right? Because the Super Bowl happens each year after the NFL season so if their first championship was in '69 that would be Super Bowl III maybe? Hmm wait I think there's some confusion here. Let me double-check: The NFL started its current version in 1967 with Super Bowl I on January 15 1967. The Vikings won their first championship in 1969 which would have been Super Bowl III because they played after the 1968 season.  But wait the context says they've played in Super Bowls IV VIII IX and XI since 1970. So let me list those years:  - IV: 1970 - VIII: 1974 (since Super Bowl I is '67 II '68 III '69 IV '70) Wait no that doesn't add up because if their first season was in 1961 they might have started in the NFL before '67. Maybe I'm mixing up the years.  Alternatively perhaps the context is simplified and just lists the Super Bowl numbers without exact years beyond those four: IV (1970) VIII (1974?) but that doesn't make sense because there's a gap between 1969 and 1970. So maybe I'm overcomplicating.  Wait let me look again. The context says ""since the league merger in 1970 they have qualified for the playoffs 27 times... played in Super Bowls IV VIII IX and XI.""  So that means their appearances were in Super Bowls 4 8 9 and 11.  Now what are the years corresponding to those Super Bowl numbers? Let me recall:  Super Bowl I: January 15 1967 Super Bowl II: January 14 1969 Super Bowl III: January 10 1971 Super Bowl IV: January 13 1972 Super Bowl V: January 12 1975 Super Bowl VI: January 11 1976 Super Bowl VII: January 14 1981 Super Bowl VIII: January 10 1985 Super Bowl IX: January 13 1988 Super Bowl X: January 12 1993 (Wait no actually Super Bowl X was in 1977?)  Hmm maybe I'm getting the years wrong. Alternatively perhaps a better approach is to note that the Vikings played in Super Bowls IV VIII IX and XI.  Assuming that:  - Super Bowl IV: 1972 - Super Bowl VIII: 1984? Wait no because between IV (1972) and VIII there's a gap. Maybe I'm mixing the numbering with the years incorrectly.  Wait perhaps it's better to look up when each Super Bowl occurred based on their number:  Here's a quick reference:  - Super Bowl I: 1967 - II: 1969 - III: 1971 - IV: 1972 - V: 1975 - VI: 1976 - VII: 1981 - VIII: 1985 - IX: 1988 - X: 1993? Wait no. Actually Super Bowl X was in 1977.  Wait I think there's a mistake here because after the 1960s come into play and the Vikings first played in the NFL in 1961 but their first championship came in '69 (Super Bowl III) then perhaps they started playing in Super Bowls starting from IV onwards.  But according to the context given they've played in Super Bowls IV VIII IX XI since 1970. So let's figure out those years:  IV: 1972 VIII: 1984? Wait no because after IV (1972) there's V in '75 VI in '76 VII in '81 then VIII in '85.  So the Vikings played in Super Bowl IV in 1972. Then again in 1985 (VIII) 1988 (IX) and 1993 (XII?) Wait but the context says they played in XI as well which would be 1995? Hmm.  Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking for when they were in the Super Bowl so based on the context it's listed as IV VIII IX and XI. So the answer should include those years. But to get the exact years:  - Super Bowl IV: 1972 - Super Bowl VIII: 1984? Wait no that can't be right because after VII (1981) then VIII is in '85.  Wait maybe I'm confusing the numbering with the actual years. Let me list them:  1. Super Bowl I - Jan 15 1967 2. II - Jan 14 1969 3. III - Jan 10 1971 4. IV - Jan 13 1972 5. V - Jan 12 1975 6. VI - Jan 11 1976 7. VII - Jan 14 1981 8. VIII - Jan 10 1985 9. IX - Jan 13 1988 10. X - Jan 12 1993? Wait no because after the '80s the Super Bowl moves to later years but I think the correct year for VIII is 1985.  Wait maybe a better way is to use known facts: The Vikings won an NFL Championship in 1969 (Super Bowl III). Then since 1970 merger they've played in several Super Bowls. According to the context they have played in IV VIII IX and XI.  So:  IV: 1972 VIII: 1985? Wait no that's incorrect because between VII (1981) and VIII would be '84 or something?  Wait maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me check an external source to confirm the years for each Super Bowl number.  But since I can't access external sources perhaps it's better to answer based on the context given. The context says they've played in Super Bowls IV VIII IX and XI after 1970. So the exact years are:  IV: 1972  VIII: 1984? No that can't be right because between VII (1981) comes VIII in '85.  Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should just list them as per the context. The user is asking for when they were in the Super Bowl so based on their context:  They played in Super Bowls IV VIII IX and XI.  So the years would be 1972 (IV) 1984? Wait no because after VII (1981) comes VIII in '85. So maybe it's:  IV: 1972  VIII: 1985  IX: 1988  XI: 1993?  Wait but I think the correct years are:  Super Bowl IV: February 6 1972 (but wait no Super Bowl IV was in January. Let me get this right.  Actually here's a corrected list based on known facts:  - Super Bowl I: Jan 15 1967 - II: Jan 14 1969 - III: Jan 10 1971 - IV: Jan 13 1972 (won by the Dallas Cowboys) - V: Jan 12 1975 (St. Louis Rams) - VI: Jan 11 1976 (Miami Dolphins) - VII: Jan 14 1981 (Pittsburgh Steelers) - VIII: Jan 10 1985 (Dallas Cowboys again) - IX: Jan 13 1988 (Minnesota Vikings) – Here they won their only Super Bowl in 1988 - X: Jan 12 1993 (Denver Broncos) Wait no that can't be right because the Vikings played in Super Bowl XI as well.  So based on this:  The Vikings have played in Super Bowls III (1969) which they won and then IV (1972) but according to the context they started playing in Super Bowls after 1970. So maybe their first appearance was IV (1972).  Wait but the context says ""since 1970"" so starting from that year which is correct because the merger happened in '70.  So:  IV: 1972 VIII: 1985 IX: 1988 (where they won) XI: ?  Wait but after 1969 they played in III and then IV. So perhaps their appearances are in Super Bowls from IV onwards.  But the context lists them as IV VIII IX XI. So let's map those:  IV: 1972 VIII: 1985? No because between VII (1981) and VIII would be '84 or so. Wait no actually after 1981 comes Super Bowl VII in January 1981 then the next is Super Bowl VIII on January 10 1985.  Then comes IX: January 13 1988  And XI would be two years later? Wait no because between 1988 and when?  Wait maybe it's better to just note that based on the context provided the Vikings have played in Super Bowls IV VIII IX and XI.  So their appearances were in these specific games. Therefore the answer is that they were in Super Bowls in 1972 (IV) but since the question is asking for when perhaps it's better to list those years based on the context without exacting the precise year from the number because I might not have all the details correct.  But given the user's context they specifically mention that the Vikings played in Super Bowls IV VIII IX and XI since 1970. So perhaps:  The Vikings were in the Super Bowl during Super Bowls IV (1972) VIII (1985) IX (1988) and XI.  But I think I'm mixing up some years here. Alternatively maybe it's better to just list those Super Bowl numbers as per the context without trying to map them exactly to the correct year.  The Minnesota Vikings were in the Super Bowl during Super Bowls IV VIII IX and XI. Specifically:  - **Super Bowl IV**: 1972 - **Super Bowl VIII**: 1985 - **Super Bowl IX**: 1988 (they won this one) - **Super Bowl XI**: 1990  However based on the context provided it's likely they played in these Super Bowls after their merger with the AFL. For a more precise answer focusing on when they were in the Super Bowl:  The Vikings played in Super Bowls IV (1972) VIII (1985) IX (1988) and XI (1990).", vikings played in super bowls iv 1972 viii 1985 ix 1988 and xi 1990,XI,0,0.13333333333333333,22.412137999999686,0.007975722606156001,0.002341836378616093,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: location of khasi hills on map of india
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the location of the Khasi Hills on a map of India. From what I remember these hills are in the northeastern part of the country. The names given include places like Bhowal Cherra (also known as Sohra and capital Cherrapunji) and others. Cherrapunji is actually the capital city of Meghalaya state. Since the Khasi Hills are associated with this region I can guess they're in Meghalaya.  I think Meghalaya is located in northeastern India between the states of Assam to the south and Meghalaya State itself being more towards the north. So on a map it should be somewhere near the northeast border but closer to the east side because Meghalaya is actually in the northern part compared to other northeast states.  I'm pretty sure that the Khasi Hills are an important cultural or geographical feature of Meghalaya. They might even have some significance like being the highest peaks there or having a specific climate maybe monsoon regions given the capital city's weather patterns.  Putting it all together the Khasi Hills should be situated in Meghalaya State on a map of India.  The Khasi Hills are located within Meghalaya State on a map of India., khasi hills are located within meghalaya state on map of india,"part of the present Indian constitutive state of Meghalaya (formerly Assam), which includes the present districts of East Jaintia Hills district, headquarter Khliehriat, West Jaintia Hills district, headquarter Jowai, East Khasi Hills district, headquarter Shillong, and West Khasi Hills district, headquarter Nongstoin",0,0.196078431372549,2.2573859999974957,0.0007831920525606843,0.00022996131268582178,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who has won 2017 women's singles korean open series badminton championship
Answer: ","Alright let's try to figure out who won the 2017 women's singles Korean Open Series Badminton Championship. I'm a bit new to this so I'll take it step by step.  First I remember that in the context provided there are some matches listed under the Semifinals Final 5 section. The participants include P.V. Sindhu He Bingjiao Nozomi Okuhara and Akane Yamaguchi. Each of them has four sets of scores: for example P.V. Sindhu has two sets at 21-17 one at 21-21 and another at 6-21? Wait that doesn't make sense because usually a badminton match is played in three or four sets.  Looking closer I see the scores like 21-17 21-21 etc. Maybe each participant has their scorecard for multiple matches they played. But how does this relate to who won the championship?  Wait perhaps the numbers are the total number of wins? Let's look: P.V. Sindhu has four sets with scores adding up to 21+17+21+6 = 65 points He Bingjiao has 10+21+16+5=52 Nozomi Okuhara has 20+21+18+8=67 and Akane Yamaguchi has 17+18=35. But that doesn't seem right because the championship is a singles event so points don't add up like that.  Wait maybe each number represents the sets they won in each match? For example P.V. Sindhu might have played three matches: first set 21-17 win second 21-16 loss third 21-8 win but I'm not sure. Alternatively perhaps it's total points.  Alternatively maybe the context is from a tournament where each player has their performance in four different matches and we need to see who won the most matches overall. But looking at the scores P.V. Sindhu seems to have more higher scores like 21-17 and 21-6 which might indicate wins.  Wait but I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The question is about the 2017 women's singles Korean Open Series Badminton Championship winner. Maybe it's a multi-year tournament where each year they have a series of matches and in 2017 someone won it.  Wait perhaps the context lists the scores for semifinalists or winners from previous years? If P.V. Sindhu has three sets at 21-17 then maybe she's the top scorer with the highest points each time she plays. Alternatively since Badminton scoring can be tricky because a player serves and wins multiple games.  Wait perhaps the numbers after her name are the number of singles titles she's won? Like P.V. Sindhu has 2017 He Bingjiao 21 Nozomi Okuhara 20 Akane Yamaguchi 18? That would make sense because the user might have copied down their current titles or something else.  Wait no looking at the context again: ""Semifinals Final 5 P.V. Sindhu 21 17 21 6 He Bingjiao 10 21 16 5 P.V. Sindhu 22 11 21 8 Nozomi Okuhara 20 21 18 8 Nozomi Okuhara 21 21 Akane Yamaguchi 17 18""  This seems to be a list of matches where each participant has four sets maybe. But how does that help determine who won the championship?  Wait perhaps the last line ""Akane Yamaguchi 17 18"" refers to her final score or total points in some way. If I think about Badminton scoring usually a match is split into games and then sets. Each game can be 11 points but sometimes it's extended to 21.  Wait maybe the numbers after each player are their scores across different matches? So P.V. Sindhu has four matches with scores of 21 17 21 and 6. Maybe these are her total points in those matches or something else.  Alternatively perhaps it's a typo and should represent wins against opponents: e.g. P.V. Sindhu won three sets (each time beating someone). But I'm not sure.  Wait maybe the context is from a specific tournament where each player has four matches with their scores listed and we need to figure out who won more points overall or had the best performance in 2017. If that's the case P.V. Sindhu might have higher numbers because she appears twice with 21s.  Alternatively perhaps it's a cumulative score where each number represents points in each set and we need to add them up for total points. Let me try adding:  For P.V. Sindhu: First match: 21 + 17 = 38 Second match: 22 + 11 + 21 + 8? Wait no the numbers seem too varied.  Alternatively maybe each number is a set result like win or loss. For example 21-17 would be a win so in her first four sets she has two wins (assuming 21-17 and 21-6) and one loss? But the context isn't clear.  I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about known winners of the Korean Open Series Badminton Championship in 2017. From what I recall P.V. Sindhu won several tournaments including that. So perhaps she's the winner.

Context: The Geographic South Pole is located on the continent of Antarctica ( although this has not been the case for all of Earth 's history because of continental drift ) . It sits atop a featureless , barren , windswept and icy plateau at an altitude of 2,835 metres ( 9,301 ft ) above sea level , and is located about 1,300 km ( 800 mi ) from the nearest open sea at Bay of Whales . The ice is estimated to be about 2,700 metres ( 9,000 ft ) thick at the Pole , so the land surface under the ice sheet is actually near sea level .
Question: where is south pole located on a map
Answer: ",Okay I need to figure out where the South Pole is located on a map based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that the Geographic South Pole is situated atop an icy plateau in Antarctica. It's at an altitude of about 2 835 meters above sea level and lies about 1 300 km (or roughly 800 miles) from the nearest open sea which is the Bay of Whales.  So putting that together on a map the South Pole would be in Antarctica. It's near an icy plateau so I should probably look for Antarctica on the map and then note where within it this specific area is. The exact point is about 1 300 km from the Bay of Whales which might help pinpoint its location more accurately.  I don't have a map here but in general terms when people talk about the South Pole on a map they always refer to Antarctica because that's where it is located. So even though the exact point is specific for most purposes it's within Antarctica.  The South Pole is located near the icy plateau in Antarctica specifically about 1 300 km from the Bay of Whales.  Answer: The South Pole is located near an icy plateau in Antarctica approximately 1 300 kilometers from the Bay of Whales., south pole is located near icy plateau in antarctica approximately 1300 kilometers from bay of whales,on the continent of Antarctica,0,0.2,2.3917403999948874,0.0008306619171661849,0.00024389944234636673,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: tiger shroff and shraddha kapoor new movie name
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out the answer based on the given context. The user is asking about Tiger Shroff and Shraddha Kapoor's new movie name.  Looking at the context provided it mentions that Tiger Shroff posted a first look poster on 1 May 2017. It also talks about the film being directed by Ahmed Khan produced by Sajid Nadiadwala along with Fox Star Studios and another entity. The film was released worldwide on March 30 2018.

Context: The text of 36 U.S.C. § 301 is suggestive and not regulatory in nature . Failure to follow the suggestions is not a violation of law . This behavioral requirement for the national anthem is subject to the same First Amendment controversies that surround the Pledge of Allegiance . For example , Jehovah 's Witnesses do not sing the national anthem , though they are taught that standing is an `` ethical decision '' that individual believers must make based on their `` conscience . ''
Question: when did it become law to stand for the national anthem
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out when the law requiring people to stand for the national anthem became effective. The context given mentions something about U.S.C. § 301 being suggestive but not regulatory and that failure to follow suggestions isn't a legal violation. It also talks about a First Amendment debate similar to the Pledge of Allegiance with an example involving Jehovah's Witnesses who don't sing the anthem because they believe it's unethical.  Hmm I think this might be referring to something specific in U.S. law history. The Pledge of Allegiance is something kids recite in schools and the national anthem thing could be related. Maybe it's about a law that was passed requiring people to stand for the anthem during official events?  Wait I recall there being debates over the years about whether the national anthem should be sung or just stood. I think it might have been in 1865 with the Civil War but no that's when the war ended and the national anthem became prominent. Maybe it was a later law.  Oh right! There was a Supreme Court case called McCulloch v. Maryland in 1819 where they talked about states not having certain powers but I'm not sure if that relates directly here.  Wait maybe it's the National Anthem Act of 1863? No that's related to the Civil War. Or perhaps it was later. Let me think... Oh! I remember now reading somewhere that in 2019 President Trump signed an Executive Order about standing for the national anthem or a substitute song during certain events.  But wait that might be more recent. The context here is about when the law became effective regarding standing. Since the answer given was 2019 I think that's correct because of the mention of it being signed into law by Trump in December 2018 or January 2019.  So putting it together the law requiring people to stand for the national anthem during official events became effective with President Trump's Executive Order in 2019. That aligns with the example provided about Jehovah's Witnesses not singing it but being exempt because their conscience says so.

Question: who has the most international goals of all time
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who has the most international goals in history based on the data provided. Let's see... The context is a list of country names with their respective players their international goals caps and goals per match.   I remember that the player with the highest number of goals would be the one we're looking for. I should go through each row and pick out the 'International goals' column to find the maximum value.  Starting from the top:  1. Iran: 109 2. Hungary: 84 3. Portugal: 81 4. Japan: 80 5. Zambia: 79 6. Iraq: 78 7. Brazil: 77 8. Kuwait: 75 9. Malawi: 71 10. Saudi Arabia: 71 ...and so on.  As I scroll down I notice that Iran has 109 goals which seems higher than the others listed. Let me check a few more to make sure:  - Germany: 71 - Mexico: 101 (Wait no Mexico is after some other entries). Wait looking again Mexico is in position 43 with 101? No checking the data provided Mexico has 101. So that's higher than some but still lower than Iran.  Wait let me make sure I'm reading this correctly. The list goes from Iran at 109 down to some other numbers. Let me confirm the top entries:  After Iran with 109 the next highest is Hungary with 84. Then Portugal has 81 Japan 80 Zambia 79 Iraq 78 Brazil 77 and so on.  Looking further down I see Mexico at position 63 with 101 goals. Oh that's higher than some but less than Iran. So the highest is indeed Iran with 109 international goals.  Iran has the most international goals with a total of 109 goals across their caps.

Question: who takes over the presidency if the vice president cant
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out who would take over the presidency if the vice president can't. The context provided mentions that under certain circumstances like death or resignation with no viable candidates left the Speaker of the House acts as President.   Wait but does it specify whether this applies only when both the President and Vice President are incapacitated? I think so because if one is unable to take over maybe the other isn't the one who steps in. So according to the context it's the Speaker who would step in during those specific scenarios.  If there is no viable President or Vice President due to their incapacitation the Speaker of the House of Representatives assumes the presidency under such circumstances.

150,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: Mendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants : plant height , pod shape and color , seed shape and color , and flower position and color . Taking seed color as an example , Mendel showed that when a true - breeding yellow pea and a true - breeding green pea were cross-bred their offspring always produced yellow seeds . However , in the next generation , the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow . To explain this phenomenon , Mendel coined the terms `` recessive '' and `` dominant '' in reference to certain traits . ( In the preceding example , the green trait , which seems to have vanished in the first filial generation , is recessive and the yellow is dominant . ) He published his work in 1866 , demonstrating the actions of invisible `` factors '' -- now called genes -- in predictably determining the traits of an organism .
Question: who is the father of genetics and what did he study
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the father of genetics is based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again.  The context starts by talking about Gregor Mendel and his work with pea plants. It mentions several traits like plant height pod shape seed shape color and flower position and color. Then it specifically uses seed color as an example to explain his experiments. He crossed true-breeding yellow and green peas and observed the results in their offspring.  In the first generation (F1) all seeds were yellow but in the next generation (F2) there was a 3:1 ratio of yellow to green seeds. Mendel came up with terms like ""recessive"" and ""dominant"" to explain why the green peas reappeared. He published his work in 1866 which is now recognized as laying the foundation for genetics.  So from this context it's clear that Gregor Mendel was the father of genetics because he studied heredity and came up with the basic principles involving dominant and recessive traits using pea plants.  Gregor Mendel is considered the father of genetics. He studied the inheritance patterns in pea plants particularly focusing on seed color demonstrating how certain traits can be passed from parents to offspring through factors now known as genes. His work laid the foundation for modern genetics with his concepts of dominant and recessive traits.",gregor mendel is considered father of genetics he studied inheritance patterns in pea plants particularly focusing on seed color demonstrating how certain traits can be passed from parents to offspring through factors now known as genes his work laid foundation for modern genetics with his concepts of dominant and recessive traits,Gregor Mendel,0,0.07547169811320754,2.4225922000041464,0.000835693873630211,0.0002453769283730213,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: The stratum lucidum ( Latin for `` clear layer '' ) is a thin , clear layer of dead skin cells in the epidermis named for its translucent appearance under a microscope . It is readily visible by light microscopy only in areas of thick skin , which are found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet .
Question: skin that covers the palms fingertips and soles of the feet
Answer: ",Okay I'm looking at this question about skin parts. The question is asking for the skin covering the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.  From the context provided it mentions something called the stratum lucidum which is a thin clear layer under the epidermis. But wait that's not directly related to the areas mentioned in the question. The key part here is about where these specific areas are found.  The context says that the stratum lucidum is visible only on thick skin like the palms of hands and soles of feet. So those areas have a lot of dead skin cells forming this clear layer under the microscope. But for the answer to the question about the skin covering those parts I don't need the detailed description of the stratum.  The answer should simply state where that skin is located based on what's given. Since it says the thick skin is found there the skin covering the palms and soles is likely referring to the epidermis or maybe even deeper layers like dermis. But more accurately since stratum lucidum is part of the epidermis the entire skin area would be the epidermis.  Wait but the question isn't about the layer; it's just asking for what covers those areas. So probably the answer is referring to the epidermis or dermis as covering those parts. But from the context the stratum lucidum is part of the epidermis. However the main covering would still be the skin.  Wait no maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question is straightforward: what covers the palms and soles? The answer should just state that it's the skin specifically the thick skin areas which include the epidermis with stratum lucidum.  The skin covering the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet is referred to as thick skin., skin covering palms of hands and soles of feet is referred to as thick skin,"The stratum lucidum (Latin for ""clear layer"")",0,0.0,3.2743607000011252,0.0011365083768412232,0.0003337022603361898,0.0,0.0,0.0

In addition to the seven claimed national titles the NCAA also recognizes 10 others : 1915 , 1949 , 1953 , 1957 , 1967 , 1973 , 1978 , 1980 , 1986 , and 2003 .
Question: when was the last time oklahoma won a national championship in football
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when Oklahoma won its last national championship in football. Let's start by looking at the context provided.   The context mentions that the team has captured 47 conference titles including some impressive streaks and divisional championships. It also lists seven claimed national championships: 1950 1955 1956 1974 1975 1985 and 2000. Additionally the NCAA recognizes ten other national championships outside of those seven but I don't think that affects my answer because the question specifically asks about Oklahoma's own national championships.  So focusing on the seven Oklahoma national titles listed: 1950 1955 1956 1974 1975 1985 and 2000. I'm looking for the most recent one among these. Let's list them in order:  - 1950 - 1955 - 1956 - 1974 - 1975 - 1985 - 2000  Looking at these years the last one is 2000. So that must be when Oklahoma won their latest national championship.  Wait but I should make sure there aren't any other national championships after 2000 mentioned elsewhere in the context. The context also lists ten others up to 2003. However those are probably not Oklahoma's just other teams' championships. So the last time Oklahoma won would still be 2000.

Question: what is the meaning of the movie wonder
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the meaning of the movie ""Wonder."" Let me start by recalling what I know about the movie. It's based on a novel by R.J. Palacio called ""The Wonder "" right? The film stars Julia Roberts Owen Wilson and Jacob Tremblay. I remember that it's about a child with Treacher Collins syndrome trying to fit in.  Wait so the main character is Daniel Tammet who has an autism-like condition. He faces challenges fitting into a normal world where people often misunderstand him because of his different abilities. The movie explores themes like inclusion and understanding diversity. It shows how he navigates school social interactions and his family dynamics while striving to be accepted.

Context: In 1980 , The Shining became the basis for a film adaptation directed by Stanley Kubrick . Kubrick 's vision for the movie differed from King 's significantly in many ways , including the portrayal of the Overlook Hotel . The exteriors of Kubrick 's Overlook were supplied by the Timberline Lodge on the slopes of Mt . Hood in Oregon . Inspiration for the interior sets ( erected at Elstree Studios in England ) came from the 1927 Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park . The management of the Timberline Lodge , fearful that guests would refuse to stay in their Room 217 if it were featured in a horror movie , insisted that Kubrick change the haunted room in the film to Room 237 .
Question: where is the hotel used in the movie the shining
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the hotel used in the movie ""The Shining"" is located. From the context given it says that the hotel's exterior was supplied by Timberline Lodge on the slopes of Mount Hood in Oregon. That part makes sense because I know Mount Hood is a place with mountainous terrain so having a lodge there would fit the eerie and isolated vibe of the movie.  Then it mentions that inspiration for the interior sets came from the 1927 Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. The Ahwahnee is an old hotel known for its historic charm and suspenseful atmosphere which aligns with the horror elements of ""The Shining."" However there's a specific note about Room 217 being changed to Room 237 because of fears that guests might refuse to stay in it if it was featured in a horror movie.  Wait so the question is asking where the hotel used in the movie is. The context mentions two places: Timberline Lodge and Ahwahnee Hotel. But I think the answer refers specifically to the exterior as being based on Timberline Lodge while the interior took inspiration from Ahwahnee. However the hotel that's actually built for the film would be a combination of these elements.  But since the question is asking where it is located and considering the context only mentions Timberline Lodge in Oregon as the source for exterior shots I think that's the main answer they're looking for. The interior details are more about inspiration than the actual hotel's location.  The hotel used in ""The Shining"" has its exteriors based on Timberline Lodge located on the slopes of Mount Hood in Oregon.

The current version of Mega Millions uses a 5 / 70 ( for the white balls ) plus 1 / 25 ( for the `` Mega Ball '' ) double matrix to select its winning numbers .
Question: what is the cash option for the mega millions
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the cash option for Mega Millions. Let me think through this step by step.  First from the context provided it mentions that Mega Millions's current format uses a 5/70 and 1/25 system. So they draw 5 white balls from 70 and 1 Mega Ball from 25. That part I understand; it's about how the winning numbers are selected.  The question is specifically asking about the cash option for Mega Millions. The context provided earlier talks about lotteries in general advertising jackpots as nominal annual installments but that might be a bit different since Mega Millions uses its own system now.  Wait looking back at the context again: it says ""the usual choice"" when someone wins the jackpot is to take an approximate present value of the installments. That sounds like they're talking about the cash value option being available as a present value rather than waiting for annual payments.  So putting that together Mega Millions's cash option must be offering the winner a lump sum payment instead of the growing annuity. Since it mentions ""approximate present value "" I think that means the cash value is calculated based on an immediate payout discounted at some rate over the years. The exact amount isn't provided in the context but from what I know generally Mega Millions offers a cash prize which is less than the jackpot advertised as annual installments.  I don't have specific numbers here so maybe the answer is just to state that the cash option provides an approximate present value of the installments. That seems consistent with how lotteries typically offer their cash prizes.  The cash option for Mega Millions provides an approximate present value of the jackpot's future payments rather than the advertised annual installments.  Answer: The cash option for Mega Millions is the approximate present value of the jackpot installments.", cash option for mega millions is approximate present value of jackpot installments,whether they wish to collect a jackpot prize in cash or annuity,0,0.17391304347826086,3.1480184999963967,0.0010910355446616133,0.00032035050051511455,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who won the battle of saratoga in 1777
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who won the Battle of Saratoga from the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.  The context mentions that the Battles of Saratoga marked a decisive victory for the Americans over the British during the American Revolutionary War. It talks about General John Burgoyne leading a large British army southward from Canada hoping to meet other British forces but they didn't arrive as expected. The battle occurred on September 19 and October 7 1777.  Wait but then it says that British General Burgoyne fought two small battles in the same area near Saratoga which were 18 days apart. Both of these failed attempts by the British to break through American forces. So if those British attempts failed does that mean the Americans won? The context clearly states that the Americans had a decisive victory at Saratoga.  So putting it all together: The battle was between the Americans and the British. The British tried twice but failed leading to the Americans' success. Therefore the answer should be that the Americans won.

Question: what does the ghost of christmas present sprinkle from his torch
Answer: ","Alright I need to answer the question about what the Ghost of Christmas Present sprinkles from his torch in the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that the spirit transports Scrooge around the city and shows him festive and depraved scenes with a little warmth from his torch as he travels. It also talks about interactions with the nephew Bob Cratchit's family and especially Tiny Tim but those aren't directly related to the question.  So focusing on the torch part: ""sprinkling a little warmth."" That seems to be the key detail here. The Ghost uses his torch to give Tiny Tim warmth which is part of Scrooge's interest in him.  Wait does he sprinkle more than just warmth? The passage says ""a little warmth from his torch "" so I should stick to that unless there's something else mentioned later. There's no mention of anything else like fire light or any other elements related to the torch beyond the warmth.

However I should make sure if ""nominees"" refers to the candidates including both president and vice-president or other positions. But since the focus here is on the President's term starting in 2017 Kovind would be the person elected as President of India.

Question: who drafted the document of the un declaration of human rights
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who drafted the UN Declaration of Human Rights. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.  I remember that the UN Declaration on Civil and Political Rights was adopted in 1948. It was a significant document because it established many fundamental rights that are now enshrined in international law like freedom of speech and religion.  Now who was involved in drafting it? The names given include Eleanor Roosevelt Peng Chun Chang from the Republic of China (which is now Taiwan) Charles Habib Malik from Lebanon William Roy Hodgson from Australia Hernán Santa Cruz from Chile René Cassin from France Alexander E. Bogomolov from the Soviet Union Charles Dukes from the United Kingdom John Peters Humphrey from Canada and others.  I think Eleanor Roosevelt was involved because she was the First Lady of the United States at the time when many UN members were attending the General Assembly. She often drafted resolutions to support the UN's goals. So it's plausible that she was one of the drafters along with Peng Chun Chang since she represented China which has a more direct claim on human rights issues there.  Peng Chun Chang is notable because her region (China) has had ongoing efforts regarding human rights despite the Chinese government's stance and suppression. So including her makes sense as someone who would contribute to such an international document.  Charles Habib Malik from Lebanon—I'm not sure about his specific role in drafting this particular document but he was a prominent figure involved with other UN documents related to the Middle East issues around that time.  I don't recall Alexander E. Bogomolov being directly associated with the Declaration on Human Rights so maybe he wasn't part of the drafting team for it. The same goes for René Cassin from France; I know he was a prominent human rights lawyer but may have contributed to other documents or committees rather than this specific UN Declaration.  So putting it together Eleanor Roosevelt and Peng Chun Chang are likely the ones who drafted the UN Declaration on Civil and Political Rights of 1948. They worked alongside other representatives from various countries to create this foundational document.  The UN Declaration on Civil and Political Rights was drafted by Eleanor Roosevelt (USA) and Peng Chun Chang (Republic of China now Taiwan).

From the context provided it mentions that upon its release Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead received critical acclaim. The reviewer Clive Barnes from The New York Times described it as ""very funny very brilliant very chilling.""   Hmm so I know that this play is part of Tom Stoppard's works and he was active in the late 20th century. He wrote a lot of plays around the 1990s. But does that mean the specific play was written in the early or late '90s?   Wait Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is a relatively short play compared to some others by Stoppard like Arcadia.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who has won the most games in the NFL in 2017. The context provided mentions ""32 Cincinnati Bengals 19 5 14 . 263 2015 AFC North."" Let me break this down.  First it looks like a season record or some sort of game summary. The numbers could represent wins and losses. So 32 games in the regular season right? For the Cincinnati Bengals they have 19 wins and 5 losses. Wait that adds up to 24 games not 32. Maybe I'm missing something here.  Oh maybe it's not per team but overall. Let me think again. The numbers could be cumulative stats for all teams combined in the AFC North division during 2017. So each team's record is represented as wins and losses. If that's the case the Bengals have 19-5 which would mean they've won more games than any other team in the division.  But the question is about who has the most wins in the entire NFL in 2017. So perhaps I need to consider all teams. The context only gives one team's record: Cincinnati Bengals with 19 wins and 5 losses. If that's the highest then they would be the answer. Alternatively maybe another team has more.  Wait no the context doesn't mention any other team's win totals beyond the Bengals' 19-5. So I think in this case it's safe to assume that Cincinnati Bengals have the most wins with 19.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the cast of the movie ""Pride of the Marines."" The user provided a context with names and their roles from another movie. Hmm let me think.  Wait but actually I remember that ""Pride of the Marines"" is a different film than whatever those names are associated with. Maybe they're from another show or movie? Like maybe ""M*A*S*H""?

I think ""Pride of the Marines"" was directed by Billy Wilder and stars Steve Martin and Michael Peña. But beyond them I don't remember exact names off the top of my head. Maybe I should cross-check if these names from the context are relevant to that movie.  Looking at the names provided: John Garfield (Al) Rosemary DeCamp (Virginia) Ann Doran (Ella May Merchant) etc. These seem familiar from other movies but not necessarily this one. So perhaps those aren't the right names for ""Pride of the Marines.""  Alternatively maybe the user confused two different movies with similar casts?

Maybe some cameos or smaller roles aren't as famous. Without more information it's hard to list the entire cast accurately from memory.

He teaches history at two different schools: John Quincy Adams Middle School for the first two seasons and Abigail Adams High School starting from the third season.

He has roles beyond just being a parent because he takes on the mentorship responsibilities with his students.  I think I've got all the necessary information here.

Question: who destroyed the first temple and exiled the two tribes of judah to babylon
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who destroyed the First Temple and exiled the two tribes of Judah to Babylon based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions Nebuchadnezzar returning after defeating the Egyptians and besieging Jerusalem leading to its destruction in 587 BCE. After that he destroyed the city wall and the Temple along with important citizens' houses. Then Zedekiah and his sons were captured; the sons were executed in front of Zedekiah who was later blinded and taken to Babylon with many others.  So from this Nebuchadnezzar is clearly mentioned as the one who destroyed the First Temple. Also the destruction resulted in the exiling of Judah's two tribes—Zedekiah and his sons—to Babylon.   I remember that the Two Tribes of Judah were Zehudah (the son of Zedekiah) and Abiail but according to the context Zedekiah was taken with many others including his sons who were executed. So Nebuchadnezzar is the one responsible for both destroying the Temple and exiling these tribes.  I think that's all the information provided here. There's no mention of anyone else involved in this action so Nebuchadnezzar must be the answer.

Context: Transition economics is a special branch of economics dealing with the transformation of a planned economy to a market economy . It has become especially important after the collapse of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe . Transition economics investigates how an economy should reform itself to endorse capitalism and democracy . There are usually two sides : one which argues for a rapid transformation and one which argues for a gradual approach . Gérard Roland 's book Transition and Economics . Politics , Markets and Firms ( MIT Press 2000 ) gives a good overview of the field . A more recent overview is provided in Transition Economies : Political Economy in Russia , Eastern Europe , and Central Asia by Martin Myant and Jan Drahokoupil .
Question: what was the initial effect of the transition from command to market economies in eastern europe
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the initial effects of transitioning from a command economy to a market economy in Eastern Europe. From the context given it mentions that transition economics deals with this transformation and that there are two main approaches: rapid versus gradual.  The context also references Gérard Roland's book and another by Myant and Drahokoupil but I don't have those details here. However I remember from general knowledge that transitioning to a market economy often comes with challenges. In the initial stages many workers in command economies were dependent on state jobs because they didn't have other options. When the transition happens these workers might lose their jobs or see their living standards drop.  I think about countries like Poland and Czech Republic where this transition happened. They probably faced issues like high unemployment reduced income levels and social unrest as people struggled to adapt to new economic structures. There was also likely a loss of political control over the economy since command economies are centrally planned whereas market economies rely more on private enterprise and market forces.  So putting it together the initial effects would include job losses decreased income increased inequality and possible social uprisings as people adapt to the new economic system.  The initial effects of transitioning from a command to a market economy in Eastern Europe included high unemployment rates reduced income levels increased inequality and potential social unrest. Many workers lost their jobs due to the shift leading to hardship and political instability as the economy moved away from central planning towards private enterprise., initial effects of transitioning from command to market economy in eastern europe included high unemployment rates reduced income levels increased inequality and potential social unrest many workers lost their jobs due to shift leading to hardship and political instability as economy moved away from central planning towards private enterprise,Inequality of opportunity,0,0.07692307692307691,2.64920020000136,0.0009108222957571288,0.00026743618001613207,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: where does the papillary layer of the skin lie
Answer: ",Alright I need to figure out where the papillary layer lies based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that the papillary dermis is the uppermost layer of the dermis. It mentions that it intertwines with the rete ridges of the epidermis and is composed of fine and loosely arranged collagen fibers.  So putting this together since it's part of the dermis and described as the uppermost layer that would place it just below the epidermis in the skin structure. The dermis is divided into layers: papillary reticular and lamellar. The papillary layer being on top means it sits above the other layers.  I should make sure I'm not confusing this with the epidermis or the hypodermis. The context clearly states it's part of the dermis so no need to involve other layers like the stratum basale in the epidermis.  The papillary layer lies within the dermis specifically as the uppermost layer of the dermal tissue., papillary layer lies within dermis specifically as uppermost layer of dermal tissue,the uppermost layer of the dermis,0,0.5,1.9271270000026561,0.0006542910883548327,0.00019211333550279362,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: total goals scored by ronaldo in la liga
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out how many goals Cristiano Ronaldo scored in La Liga based on the provided context. Let me start by looking at the data given.  I see a table with several players' names and some stats. The columns are Rank Nat (nationality) Years Goals Apps (appearances) Ratio. Wait that's interesting because the first three columns have numerical values but ""Nat"" is actually a name not a number. That might be a mistake in formatting.  Looking at each row:  1. Lionel Messi: 2004 years? No wait the table shows ""Years"" as 2004 for Messi which doesn't make sense because his stats would cover more than one year. Maybe that's a typo or an error. Similarly Cristiano Ronaldo has ""Years"" listed as 2009 but that seems off because he has multiple seasons.  Wait maybe the ""Years"" column is just indicating the starting year of their career in La Liga not all years. Or perhaps it's supposed to show something else but I'm a bit confused there. But regardless I need to find Ronaldo's goals in La Liga.  Looking through the rows:  Cristiano Ronaldo is listed as Rank 2 with ""Years"" 2009 Goals 309 Apps 290 and Ratio 1.06. Wait that ratio doesn't seem right for a striker's stats. Maybe it's goals per game or something else.  But the question specifically asks for total goals scored in La Liga. So looking at Ronaldo's row: Goals is 309 which probably refers to his total goals in La Liga. The Applications (apps) are 290 but that might not be necessary here since we're only asked about goals.  So based on this data it seems like the answer should be 309 goals.

175,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: The kudzu plant was introduced to the United States from Japan in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia . Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition . The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi . It has been recorded in Nova Scotia , Canada , in Columbus , Ohio , and in all five boroughs of New York City .
Question: when was kudzu introduced to the united states
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the kudzu plant was introduced to the United States. From what I remember reading earlier there's some information about its introduction tied to expositions.  The context mentions that it was first brought to the U.S. from Japan in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. Then in 1883 it was introduced further south to the Southeast at the New Orleans Exposition.   I think the question is asking for the general time of introduction into the U.S. not specifically the southeastern part since that's more regional. The first mention is in 1876 which seems to be the main point. Even though it spread later to other areas the initial introduction was in 1876.  So I should make sure my answer reflects when it was introduced overall into the U.S. not just where or when that specific part happened. The key detail is the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.

Question: largest state in the us by land mass
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out which is the largest state in the United States by land area. Hmm let me think. I remember that Alaska and Texas are really big states but I'm not sure if either of them is the biggest.  First I should probably recall some basic facts about these two states. I know Alaska is one of the biggest maybe even the largest in terms of total area when including water. But then there's Texas which I think is also quite large. How do they compare?  Wait I remember something about the Four Corners where all four states meet: Arizona Colorado New Mexico and Texas. I believe Texas is one of the largest by land mass in the contiguous 48 states. But what about Alaska? Isn't she bigger overall when you include water? So maybe the total area including water makes her larger.  Also I think Rhode Island is really small so it's probably not a contender here. And states like Wyoming are pretty big but might be smaller than Texas or Alaska.  Another thought: I've heard of Wyoming being one of the biggest in terms of per capita land area which would make sense since it's sparsely populated and has lots of open space. But again that's not necessarily the largest by total area.  Wait so if I consider all the states including water Alaska is definitely the largest. Texas might be the second or third biggest in terms of land area alone. So perhaps the answer is Texas being the largest contiguous state but when considering all areas (including water) Alaska is the biggest overall.  But the question just asks for the largest by land mass so maybe it's Texas then. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes Alaska includes the ocean as part of its total area which would make her larger than Texas. So if we're strictly talking about land area without including water Texas might be the largest.  I think I need to verify this information. From what I recall Texas is indeed one of the largest states in terms of land mass especially when you exclude water areas like lakes and rivers. Alaska's total area including water makes it larger than Texas overall. So if the question is about land mass without considering water Texas might be the answer but if we're talking about total area including water then Alaska.  But since the user provided data that includes various metrics for states I need to check which state has the highest land area based on the given information. Looking at the data I see ""Land Area"" listed for several states:  - Texas: 268 594 mi² - Alaska: 663 267 mi² (but this might include water) - Arizona: 113 990 - California: 155 596 - and so on.  Wait but in the data provided earlier there's a ""Contiguous United States Total"" which is $3 120 426.47$ for Land Area. The states listed under this are all contiguous except Texas maybe? Or wait no—Texas isn't included in that total because it's part of the 50 states plus DC.  Looking at the provided data again:  - For the Contiguous United States Total: $3 120 426.47$ for Land Area and $8 081 867$ for Total Area (including water? Or just land?) Wait looking at individual states some have ""Total Area"" that includes water.  Wait a second in the data given earlier each state has entries like ""Land Area"" ""Total Area"" and sometimes ""Population"". For example:  - Texas: 268 594 (Land Area) and maybe more for Total Area. But in the data provided by the user it's hard to tell because some states list both Land Area and Total Area.  Wait looking at the first entry after the question:  The first line is ""70010324 809 504"". Maybe that represents something else but perhaps each state has multiple entries with different metrics like population or area.  But actually now I realize that this might be a formatting issue where each state's data is split into multiple lines. For example:  - The first entry after ""Question:"" starts with 7001... which probably corresponds to a state code and then numbers for various statistics.  However it seems the user provided a list of states with various metrics like population area etc. but in an unformatted way. So I need to parse through these lines correctly.  Looking at the data:  - The first entry is ""70010324 809504"" which might be a state code followed by some numbers. But given that it's hard to interpret without proper formatting perhaps each line represents a different statistic for a state.  Wait actually looking at the data:  Each state has two lines: one starting with ""7001..."" and another with ""7002..."". The 7001 probably refers to population-related stats while 7002 includes area or total.  For example: - ""70010324 809504"" might be a state's population. - Then ""7002100000000000000 ♠ 68.34 177 7002100000000000000 ♠ 61.05 158"" seems to be area stats.  But without knowing exactly what each number represents it's a bit confusing. However I can try to make sense of the patterns.  Assuming that ""7001xxxxx"" relates to population and other demographic stats while ""7002xxxxx"" includes area metrics like total land area or water area.  So for each state:  - 7001 entry: likely population. - 7002 entry: likely area (maybe total area including water? Or just land?)  But some states have two entries with the same base number which might be a formatting issue. For example ""7001946900000000000 ♠ 94.69 %"" so perhaps this is population with a percentage.  Similarly ""7002100000000000000 ♠ 68.34 177 7002100000000000000 ♠ 61.05 158"" might be area stats but it's unclear.  Given the complexity of parsing this data without proper formatting or headers I might need to make an educated guess based on my existing knowledge.  From general US state facts:  - Alaska is the largest by total area when including water. - Texas is the second-largest in terms of land mass alone. - California is also very large but perhaps not as much as Texas or Alaska depending on how you count (including water).  So if we're strictly talking about land mass Texas might be larger than Alaska. But since the data includes ""Total Area"" which probably adds water making Alaska bigger overall.  But in the question it's just asking for largest by land mass so maybe Texas is the answer because when you exclude water she's smaller but her land area alone makes her very large as well.  Wait no—Alaska has a much larger land area compared to Texas. Let me double-check:  Upon checking reliable sources (in my mind) Alaska's land area without water is about 663 267 square miles while Texas' land area is approximately 268 594 square miles.  So if we're strictly talking about land mass excluding water Texas would be the largest. But including water Alaska is still larger overall.  But since the question asks for ""largest by land mass "" it's likely referring to total land without including water. Therefore Texas might be the answer based on this data set.  Wait but in the provided data Texas has a Land Area of 268 594 mi² (from earlier) while Alaska's is under Total Area at 3 531 905.43 and 7001930200000000000 ♠ 93.02 %. Hmm it's confusing because the data might be mixing population percentages with area.  Alternatively perhaps the ""Total Area"" for Alaska includes water making her larger than Texas' land mass alone.  But I think in this context the answer expected is Texas as the largest state by land mass excluding water while Alaska is the largest when including water.

Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who sings ""Somebody's Watching Me"" alongside Michael Jackson. Let me start by recalling what I know from the context provided.  The song is a single by Rockwell released in 1984 as his debut single and lead single from his album of the same name. It was released by Motown. The context mentions that it features former Jackson 5 members Michael Jackson on vocals in the chorus and Jermaine Jackson providing additional backing vocals.  Wait so both Michael and Jermaine are mentioned as part of the song's performers. Michael is featured in the chorus which suggests he has a prominent role in the vocal delivery.Jermaine is listed as having additional backing vocals meaning he contributes harmonically but perhaps not as lead vocal as Michael.  So putting that together the song features both Michael Jackson and Jermaine Jackson from the Jackson 5. That makes sense because they were part of that group before Michael left to pursue his solo career.  I should make sure I'm answering who sings it with Michael Jackson.

It's become a tradition where they play against another team from their division since it makes sense to have home support during the bye week after the regular season.  Wait who are their usual opponents? I think it's either the Redskins or the Rams because those are the other teams in Washington. Redskins make sense because they're nearby and have been around for a long time while Rams might come from Southern California but play on Monday night games sometimes due to scheduling.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who sang ""I Put a Spell on You"" from the movie Hocus Pocus. The context given mentions that Bette Midler covered the song in the film and performed it again during her 2015 tour with a similar costume.   Wait but the question specifically asks about ""i put a spell on you "" not ""I Put a Spell on You."" Oh maybe there's a different version where a different artist sang that exact title? Or perhaps I'm mixing up song titles from the movie.  Looking back at Hocus Pocus the main songs are ""Hocus Pocus"" and ""You Can't Handle the Heat "" but I think some other songs might have been covered or arranged differently. Bette Midler did her version in the film with some dance moves so maybe that's where the song in question comes from.  I'm trying to recall if there was another performer who sang ""I Put a Spell on You."" Maybe it's not the same track but a similar-sounding song?

Epidemiologists can also work in for - profit organizations such as pharmaceutical and medical device companies in groups such as market research or clinical development .
Question: epidemiologists attempt to explain the link between health and variables such as
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what epidemiologists study. The question is asking about the variables epidemiologists look at when explaining links between health and certain factors.  Looking back at the context provided it mentions that epidemiologists work in various settings including public health services where they investigate and combat disease outbreaks. So their main job involves studying diseases and how they spread or don't spread.  The question specifically asks about the variables they examine. From what I remember epidemiology is all about understanding the distribution and determinants of health outcomes. That includes looking at factors that might influence disease occurrence like environmental conditions behaviors genetic makeup etc.  In the context given it's mentioned that they work on investigating outbreaks which would involve looking into what variables could be causing those outbreaks. For example they might look at where the disease started how it spread who was affected and what differed between cases and non-cases.  So putting this together epidemiologists study variables such as environmental factors (like contaminated water) behaviors (like poor sanitation leading to illness) genetic factors (maybe certain inherited traits that predispose someone to a condition) social factors (like living conditions or access to healthcare) and other health-related attributes like exposure to pathogens or vaccines.  I should make sure not to include things that are outside of their scope like personal choices or unrelated environmental issues. They focus more on the measurable and modifiable factors that can influence disease spread and occurrence.

Context: Plasmodesmata ( singular : plasmodesma ) are microscopic channels which traverse the cell walls of plant cells and some algal cells , enabling transport and communication between them . Plasmodesmata evolved independently in several lineages , and species that have these structures include members of the Charophyceae , Charales , Coleochaetales and Phaeophyceae ( which are all algae ) , as well as all embryophytes , better known as land plants . Unlike animal cells , almost every plant cell is surrounded by a polysaccharide cell wall . Neighbouring plant cells are therefore separated by a pair of cell walls and the intervening middle lamella , forming an extracellular domain known as the apoplast . Although cell walls are permeable to small soluble proteins and other solutes , plasmodesmata enable direct , regulated , symplastic transport of substances between cells . There are two forms of plasmodesmata : primary plasmodesmata , which are formed during cell division , and secondary plasmodesmata , which can form between mature cells .
Question: what are plasmodesmata and what is their function
Answer: ",Okay so I need to answer the question about what plasmodesmata are and their function based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by explaining that plasmodesmata are microscopic channels found in plant cells and some algal cells. These channels allow for transport and communication between cells. It mentions that they evolved independently in several lineages including specific groups of algae like Charophyceae Charales Coleochaetales and Phaeophyceae as well as all embryophytes which are land plants.  It also notes a key difference from animal cells: almost every plant cell has a polysaccharide cell wall surrounding it. So neighboring plant cells have two layers of cell walls with the middle lamella in between forming an extracellular domain called the apoplast. However plasmodesmata function even though cell walls are somewhat permeable to small molecules and solutes.  The context then explains that there are two types of plasmodesmata: primary ones formed during cell division and secondary ones that form between mature cells. Their main function is enabling direct regulated symplastic transport of substances between cells.   So putting this together the answer should include what plasmodesmata are (microscopic channels in plant and some algal cells) and their function (allowing transport and communication via symplastic pathways). I need to make sure it's concise and direct without extra details.  Plasmodesmata are microscopic channels found in plant cells and certain algal cells that facilitate transport and communication between them.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what type of novel ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" is based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that the book is a psychological fiction. That's one aspect right there. Psychological fiction typically deals with themes like mental health sanity and the effects of society or personal choices. It often explores complex human emotions and internal conflicts rather than external events.  Looking at the other details provided: it's by James Hilton who was known for his novels that delve into deep psychological aspects especially concerning isolation and mental state. The illustrator is Ethel 'Bip' Pares but I don't think that affects the genre type directly; she might have contributed to the artwork rather than the narrative style.  The publication dates are June 1934 in the USA and October 1934 in the UK which suggests it's a relatively old novel published before the mid-20th century. The OCLC number is given as 8462789 but I don't think that helps with determining the genre.  Since the context explicitly states it's psychological fiction that should be sufficient to classify it.

Hmm from what I remember this has to do with how neurons communicate via signals called neurotransmitters. I think it was someone in the mid-1800s or maybe early 1900s.   I recall learning about both Santiago Ramón y Collado and Ivan Pavlov. Collado worked on how nerves transmit electrical impulses but wasn't his work about electricity? Wait no I might be mixing that up with another scientist like John5 or someone else. Maybe it was someone else entirely.

That leaves me thinking maybe it's Santiago Ramón y Collado who discovered the role of chemicals in neural communication but I'm not entirely sure about the exact details. Alternatively could it be another scientist like Hans Eysing or someone else from that time?  I think the correct answer is Santiago Ramón y Collado. He was an Argentinean neurophysiologist who contributed to understanding how nerves transmit electrical impulses through a chain of chemical reactions in the 1860s. That makes sense because he studied the effects of electric currents on nerves and found that there were both electrical and chemical changes happening which led him to propose that chemicals play a role in transmitting signals between neurons.

Dr. Dudrick collaborated with Dr. Willmore and Dr. Vars to complete the work necessary to make this nutritional technique safe and successful .
Question: which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through tpn
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out which condition would most likely require nutrition delivered through TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition). From what I remember in my studies TPN is used when a patient can't eat or needs extra calories and nutrients.   The context provided mentions Dr. Dudrick's work with Beagle puppies and newborn babies with catastrophic gastrointestinal malignancies. Catastrophic gastrointestinal issues probably mean severe or life-threatening problems like cancer or other serious diseases affecting the gut. These conditions often lead to malnutrition because the body isn't functioning properly so they can't absorb nutrients through their intestines.  So if a patient has such a condition TPN would be necessary to provide them with essential nutrients via IV directly. This makes sense because their digestive systems are compromised and they might not have the enzymes needed to break down certain foods or absorb what they eat.  I don't think chronic conditions like diabetes would need TPN unless there's severe complications but the context specifically talks about gastrointestinal malignancies which are more likely to require this. Also burns or Trauma can sometimes use TPN if absorption is hindered but again the question points towards a gastrointestinal issue.  Therefore the condition described in the context—catastrophic gastrointestinal malignancies—would most likely require TPN because of the severe malnutrition resulting from the disease.

He claims to have been the only man whom Flint ever feared .

His relationship with Jim Hawkins , the novel 's protagonist and narrator , is interesting , as he serves as a mentor and eventually father - figure to Jim , creating much shock and emotion when it is discovered that he is in charge of the mutiny , and especially when Jim must confront and fight him later on . Although willing to change sides at any time to further his own interests , Silver has compensating virtues : he is wise enough to pay attention to money management , in contrast to the spendthrift ways of most of the pirates , and is physically courageous despite his disability ; for instance , when Flint 's cache is found to be empty , he coolly stands his ground against five active seamen despite having only Jim , a boy in his teens , to back him .
Question: how did long john silver lose his leg in treasure island
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out how Long John Silver lost his leg in Treasure Island based on the provided context. Let me read through the given information carefully.  The passage mentions that Long John Silver had a pet parrot named Captain Flint who would nibble on seeds. It also states that Silver claimed to have served in the Royal Navy and lost his leg under ""the immortal Hawke."" Then it describes the injury: his left leg was cut off close by the hip and he carried a crutch hopping about on it like a bird.  So putting this together the context clearly says that Silver lost his leg under the circumstances described.

Question: who did the mavericks beat in the finals
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the Mavericks lost to in the Finals based on the context provided. Let me read through the context carefully.  The Heat started the season with five straight wins. They finished second in the Eastern Conference behind the Chicago Bulls with 46 wins. Then they went to the Finals and beat the Knicks Pacers and Celtics in five six and seven games respectively. After losing Game 1 to the Thunder they won four straight to capture their second NBA championship.  Wait the Mavericks are mentioned here as a team that lost to the Heat in Game 1 of the Finals. So the Mavericks were the opponent when the Heat lost their first game.  I think the Mavericks are another team maybe from Texas since Mavericks usually refers to Dallas. But in this context it's about the Heat and their opponents in the Finals. The Heat played against the Knicks (in Game 5) Pacers (Game 6) and Celtics (Game 7). Then they lost Game 1 to the Thunder.  So the Mavericks would be a different team perhaps the Los Angeles Clippers or something else. But according to the context given I don't see them being named as one of the teams beaten in the Finals by the Heat. The Heat only mentioned beating Knicks Pacers Celtics in their first three games of the Finals.  Wait maybe there's confusion here between Mavericks and something else. Let me recheck: the user is asking about the Mavericks losing in the Finals. But in the context it's the Heat that lost Game 1 to the Thunder not the Mavericks. The Mavericks might be a different team altogether perhaps a local one like Dallas.  But since the context doesn't explicitly mention who the Mavericks played against in the Finals maybe I need to infer from what's given. Wait no looking back: ""After losing Game 1 to the Thunder the Heat would win four straight games to capture their second NBA championship."" So the Mavericks aren't directly mentioned as one of the teams they played in the Finals. They only lost to the Thunder in Game 1.  Hmm maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The user might be confused between the Mavericks and the Heat's opponent. Since the context doesn't specify who the Mavericks were against in the Finals perhaps it's a different team altogether. But without more info I can't determine that.  Wait but looking again: ""the Heat would beat the New York Knicks  Indiana Pacers and Boston Celtics in five  six  and seven games respectively."" So those are their opponents before they went to the Finals against the Mavericks? No wait the Mavericks were an opponent after Game 1. Or perhaps the Mavericks lost to the Heat in Game 1 but the question is about who the Mavericks lost to in the Finals.  Wait no the context says that after losing Game 1 to the Thunder they won four straight to win the championship. So the Mavericks weren't part of those games; it was against the Heat's previous opponents: Knicks Pacers Celtics.  So maybe the user is mixing up the teams. The Mavericks lost before reaching the Finals? Or perhaps the Mavericks didn't lose in the Finals because they were the ones who lost Game 1 to the Heat.  Wait this is getting confusing. Let me try to outline it:  - Heat starts with five wins. - They make the Eastern Conference finals and beat Knicks (5) Pacers (6) Celtics (7) in Games 5 6 7 respectively. - Then they lose Game 1 of Finals to Thunder. - Then they win four straight games after that to win their second championship.  So the Mavericks are mentioned as losing Game 1 to the Heat. So who did the Mavericks beat in the Finals? The context doesn't say because the Heat didn't face them again; it's about the Mavericks losing before reaching the Finals but maybe they were a different team altogether.  Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The user is asking who did the Mavericks lose to in the Finals. But according to the given context the Mavericks only played the Heat and lost Game 1. They didn't play in the Finals because the Heat proceeded further. So maybe the answer isn't provided here.  Alternatively perhaps the Mavericks are the same as the Clippers or another team not mentioned but without info I can't say. The user might be confused between the Heat's opponent (Mavericks) and their own journey.  So in conclusion based on the context given the Mavericks didn't play against any other teams in the Finals because they were knocked out early by the Heat.  The Mavericks did not lose to any team in the NBA Finals based on the provided context. The Heat proceeded further after losing Game 1 to the Thunder and never faced the Mavericks again.

Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out when coffee was first made into a drink. The context given says that the earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in Yemen's Sufi monasteries during the middle of the 15th century.   Hmm okay so the key points here are ""middle of the 15th century"" and ""Yemen's Sufi monasteries."" I think this means that around the mid-1400s or maybe late 1400s coffee was being consumed in Yemen through Sufi practices. But does that mean it was made into a drink then?  Wait the context mentions both drinking and knowledge of the tree. So perhaps earlier than that people knew about coffee beans but didn't make them into drinks yet? Maybe they used them for tea or something else.  So if the earliest credible evidence is in the 15th century it's likely that coffee was being consumed as a drink then. I don't think it's much earlier because before that maybe people just ground the beans but didn't make a proper drink out of it. So probably the answer is around mid-15th century.

Context: Proinsulin is synthesized on membrane associated ribosomes found on the rough endoplasmic reticulum , where it is folded and its disulfide bonds are oxidized .

Question: mention the chemical change that proinsulin undergo to be able to act as mature insulin
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out this question about proinsulin and why it can become mature insulin. The context given talks about how proinsulin is synthesized on ribosomes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It mentions that proinsulin has disulfide bonds which are oxidized. Then it's transported to the Golgi apparatus where it gets packaged into secretory vesicles and processed by proteases.  The question asks for the chemical change that proinsulin undergoes to become mature insulin. From what I remember when proteins are synthesized certain modifications happen. Proinsulin is an precursor to insulin so it's going through some changes during processing.  In the context it says that during transport to the Golgi apparatus proinsulin is processed by proteases into mature insulin. Proteases are enzymes that break down proteins right? So maybe this means that certain parts of proinsulin are being cut off or modified chemically.  Wait the question specifically asks about a chemical change. Oxidation of disulfide bonds would be a chemical change because it involves breaking and forming sulfur bonds. But does this oxidation help in making mature insulin?  Let me think again. Proinsulin has 35 fewer amino acids than mature insulin. So some part is being removed. The context says that the C-peptide is abstracted from the center of the proinsulin sequence while the B and A chains remain connected by disulfide bonds.  So to become mature insulin which doesn't have those disulfide bonds (since it's mature) maybe the disulfide bonds are cleaved. But oxidation would typically form more sulfur bonds not break them. So perhaps that's not the case here.  Alternatively if proteases process proinsulin into mature insulin by removing parts of it this might involve hydrolysis reactions where proteins are broken down into smaller peptides or amino acids. That would be a chemical change because it involves breaking chemical bonds between amino acids.  So putting this together the oxidation of disulfide bonds is part of the initial processing in the rough ER but to make mature insulin proteases must process proinsulin further by breaking it chemically maybe cutting off parts or cleaving bonds. The removal of 4 amino acids and forming the C-peptide suggests that some part of proinsulin is being excised.  Wait I'm a bit confused. If disulfide bonds are oxidized in proinsulin does that mean they become oxidized into something else? Or do they stay as is but get broken down further?  I think mature insulin doesn't have the disulfide bonds anymore because those bonds are usually present in pre-insulin but then cleaved during processing. So maybe when proteases work on proinsulin they break the disulfide bonds by adding hydrogen peroxide or another oxidizing agent causing them to be cleaved into smaller peptides.  But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively perhaps the oxidation is part of the initial step where the proinsulin becomes suitable for transport through the Golgi apparatus but once it's there other proteases break down specific parts chemically to form mature insulin.  In any case the key point is that a chemical change occurs in processing and oxidation might be one such change. But since the question mentions the chemical change proinsulin undergoes to become mature insulin maybe it's the cleavage of disulfide bonds via oxidative proteases activity.  The chemical change proinsulin undergoes to become mature insulin involves the cleavage of disulfide bonds through oxidation by proteases allowing the formation of mature insulin without disulfide bonds., chemical change proinsulin undergoes to become mature insulin involves cleavage of disulfide bonds through oxidation by proteases allowing formation of mature insulin without disulfide bonds,post translational modification,0,0.0,5.912286799997673,0.0020810486236364474,0.0006110387250353,0.0,0.0,0.0

Fructose is found in honey , tree and vine fruits , flowers , berries , and most root vegetables .
Question: where does the sweetness of fruit come from
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the sweetness of fruits comes from. Let me think about what I know regarding fruits and their sugar content. From the context provided earlier fructose is mentioned as one of the three dietary monosaccharides—along with glucose and galactose. These are absorbed directly into the blood during digestion.  Hmm so if fructose is a key component in sweetness maybe that's where it comes from. I remember that fruits like apples pears and cherries have high fructose content. Also some root vegetables such as carrots and beets contain fructose too. That makes sense because without enough fructose these fruits wouldn't taste sweet.  Wait but how exactly does fructose contribute to sweetness? I think it's a sugar that the body perceives as sweet after being absorbed from the intestines. The absorption part is important here—without the digestive system breaking down and absorbing it we wouldn't get the sweet sensation.  So putting this together the sweetness must come from the presence of fructose in fruits. It works alongside other sugars like glucose to give that sweet taste that we enjoy in various foods.

Question: the probability of making a type i error when retaining ho at the .05 level of significance is
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out this statistics question. The question is about the probability of making a Type I error when we retain the null hypothesis (HO) at the 0.05 significance level.   First I remember that in hypothesis testing there are two types of errors: Type I and Type II. Type I error happens when we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis when it's actually true. The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by alpha (α) which is also called the significance level.  The question mentions setting the significance level at 0.05 so α = 0.05 or 5%. This means that there's a 5% chance of rejecting HO when it's true. But wait the question is asking about making a Type I error when we RETAIN HO not when we reject it.  Hmm if the significance level is 0.05 that's the probability of a Type I error when you reject HO. But what about when you fail to reject HO? Actually failing to reject HO doesn't mean there's no effect; it just means there's not enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. The probability related to Type I errors is specifically when you incorrectly reject HO.  So if we're retaining HO at 0.05 significance level the probability of a Type I error in that scenario would be zero because Type I error only occurs when you reject HO when it's true. Retaining HO isn't an error in this context; it means no error is made regarding Type I or Type II.  The probability of making a Type I error when retaining HO at the 0.05 significance level is **zero** because Type I errors occur only when rejecting a true null hypothesis not when failing to reject it., probability of making type i error when retaining ho at 005 significance level is zero because type i errors occur only when rejecting true null hypothesis not when failing to reject it,5%,0,0.0,3.0412835000024643,0.0010593946575529413,0.00031106008456890537,0.0,0.0,0.0

Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who sings the song ""The Windmills of Your Mind."" From what I remember about The Beatles they had a lot of hits during their Fab Four days. Let me think... I know that ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" is from their album ""Let It Be "" which was released in 1979.   Wait but when was that? Oh right that's after The Beatles split up. John Lennon and Paul McCartney were still together at the time. Did they write it themselves or collaborate on a different song?  I recall that ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" was written by Lennon and McCartney because I remember hearing them sing it in their early days before the split. There's also another version called ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "" which was written by Lennon and released after the breakup.   So putting it together since ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" is from ""Let It Be "" that must mean John Lennon and Paul McCartney sang it. They didn't split until later so they were still working together at that point.

Question: where will the next summer and winter olympics be held
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out where the next Summer and Winter Olympics will be held. Let me start by looking at the data provided.   First I see a list of events with various details like location dates and types of sports. The years go all the way up to 2030 which is when W026 XXVI is scheduled. From what I understand the Olympics are held every four years alternating between Summer and Winter events.  Looking at the data I need to identify the next two entries after 2018 because that's where the last event mentioned is. Let me scan through them:  - W023 XXIII is in 2018 with events on February 9 and 25 in Tokyo. - Then there's W024 XXIV for 2020 which is also in Tokyo I believe but looking at the details it mentions Beijing China. Wait no actually W024 XXIV for Summer is in Paris from July 24 to August 9 2020. - After that W025 XXV is for 2022 in Los Angeles United States North America specifically the Summer Olympics. So that would be the next Summer Games after Tokyo.  Now since the Winter Olympics alternate every four years as well I need to check if there's a mention of any Winter events beyond W023. Scanning through W016 XVI was in 1992 at Barcelona and then W017 XVII in 1994 in Lillehammer Norway for the Winter Games.  Wait actually looking more carefully after W023 XXIII in 2018 (Summer) W024 XXIV is Summer 2020 in Paris. Then W025 XXV is Summer 2022 in LA. So there's no mention of any Winter Olympics scheduled beyond W017 XVII which was in 1994.  So the next Winter Olympics after 1994 would be in 2026 right? Because every four years alternates between Summer and Winter. Let me check if that's covered. Yes under W025 XXV for 2030 there's a TBD entry under S34 XXXIV which is the next Summer Games. So the prior Winter Games would be in 2026.  Wait actually I'm getting confused because the data goes up to 2030 but the last explicitly mentioned event is W025 XXV for the Summer in Los Angeles in 2022 and then S34 XXXIV for 2028. So perhaps the Winter Olympics after 1994 isn't listed here beyond 1994.  Wait no looking again: the data lists up to W026 XXVI in 2030 with a TBD but before that under S33 XXXIII for 2024 and S34 XXXIV for 2028 both are TBD. So maybe the next Winter Olympics after 1994 is not listed here. Alternatively perhaps it's in 2026.  Wait let me think: The 1994 Winter Games were in Lillehammer Norway (W017 XVII). Then the next Winter Games would be in 1998? But looking at the data I don't see any mention of a Winter event in 1998. Maybe it's not listed because they're held only every four years.  Wait no actually the correct answer is that after 1994 the next Winter Games were in 2006 in Salt Lake City (S19 XIX). Wait looking at the data: W017 XVII was in 1994. Then S19 XIX in 2002. No wait that's Summer. Oh no under the data I see:  Looking back W016 XVI was in 1992 (Barcelona) W017 XVII in 1994 (Lillehammer). Then S19 XIX was in 2002 (Athens) for Summer and maybe another Winter event after that? But according to the data there's no mention beyond 1994. Wait perhaps I'm missing something.  Wait looking at W018 XVIII which is in 1998 but it's marked as TBD because it might not have been scheduled yet when this data was entered. Then S20 XX in 2006 would be the next Summer Games in Salt Lake City (S20 XX). So after that W21 XXI in 2010 and so on.  But according to the data provided the next Winter Olympics beyond 1994 isn't listed. Therefore perhaps the answer is that the next Winter Games will be in 2038 in Albertville France (W26 XXVI). Wait no: looking at W025 XXV for 2022 and W026 XXVI for 2026 both are Summer Games. So maybe there's a gap between 2026 and the next Winter Games in 2038.  Alternatively perhaps the user provided data only up to 2030 so the next Winter Games after 1994 would be in 2026 or 2030. Wait but according to my knowledge the 2026 Winter Olympics were planned in Albertville France by February 2026.  Wait I'm getting confused because when looking at W025 XXV for 2022 and then S34 XXXIV for 2028 are both TBD. So perhaps the next Winter Games after 1994 would be in 2026 which is under W026 XXVI but that's for Summer.  Wait no I'm mixing up Summer and Winter here. Let me structure it:  - 1994: Winter Olympics in Lillehammer Norway (W017 XVII) - Next Winter Games would be in 1998? But the data doesn't list an event for that year.  Wait no the correct answer is that after 1994 the next Winter Games were in Salt Lake City in 2002 as part of S19 XIX. Then the next would be in 2006 in_February 2006? Wait no: looking at W018 XVIII for 1998 is marked as TBD so maybe it's not scheduled yet.  But according to my knowledge the Winter Olympics were held every four years after 1948. So from 1994 next would be in 2006 then 2010 etc. But perhaps based on the data provided the only Winter event listed is in 1994.  So going back to the data: under W017 XVII (1994) then S19 XIX for Summer in 2002 which would be the next Summer Games after 1994. Then W20 XX for Winter in 2006? Wait but looking at the data W018 XVIII is marked as TBD for 1998.  Wait no perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The user provided a list where the next Summer Games after 2018 would be in 2022 (Los Angeles) and then the Winter Games in 2026 but according to my knowledge the 2026 Winter Olympics were scheduled in Salt Lake City.  But looking at the data S34 XXXIV for 2028 is TBD. Hmm maybe I'm missing something here.  Wait perhaps based on the data provided the next Summer Games after 2018 would be in Los Angeles in 2022 (S33 XXXIII) and then the Winter Games would be in 2026 but according to W025 XXV for 2022 is Summer in LA so maybe the next Winter would be in 2026. But under S34 XXXIV it's for 2028.  Wait no perhaps I'm miscounting. The data shows:  - W017 XVII: 1994 (Winter) - Then W018 XVIII: 1998 is marked as TBD - So maybe the next Winter Games after 1994 would be in 2030? But according to my knowledge that's not correct.  Wait no perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The data shows entries up to W026 XXVI (2030) but the only Winter event mentioned is W017 XVII in 1994. So maybe based on this data there are no plans for a Winter Olympics scheduled after 1994 listed.  Alternatively perhaps the user's data is incomplete or incorrect beyond 2026. But given that I think the next Summer Games will be in Los Angeles in 2022 and the next Winter Games would be in Salt Lake City in 2026.  The next **Summer Olympics** will be held in **Los Angeles United States** in **July 29 to August 7 2022** (S33 XXXIII). The **Winter Olympics** are scheduled for **Salt Lake City United States** from **February 8 to February 19 2026** (W26 XXVI)., next summer olympics will be held in los angeles united states in july 29 to august 7 2022 s33 xxxiii winter olympics are scheduled for salt lake city united states from february 8 to february 19 2026 w26 xxvi,"Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Olympics, Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics",0,0.2040816326530612,18.000624599997536,0.006417720313375117,0.001884374825930519,0.0,0.0,0.0

Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out what the three dots (∴) mean in math. From the context provided it says that the therefore sign is used before a logical consequence like the conclusion of a syllogism. So the three dots represent ""therefore."" In mathematics this symbol is often used when stating a result or conclusion based on previous reasoning. It's complementary to another symbol ∵ which I think stands for ""because.""

Here I can see that ""Photograph"" is listed under 1973 with the song details: Artist - Ringo Starr Song Title - Photograph Album - Ringo B - side and then the format as a 7-inch single.   Additionally there are other singles like ""Back Off Boogaloo "" ""You're Sixteen "" etc. but these might not directly help with who wrote ""Photograph.""   Wait in another part of the context under ""Singles (Compilation) "" Ringo's track listing includes 10 tracks. On side one number four is ""Photograph"" by Ringo Starr. So that confirms it was released on side one.  But I'm looking for who wrote it. The context doesn't explicitly mention the writers of each song in the singles compilation except when providing details like album and format. However there's another section with song listing under the track listing: ""I'm the Greatest"" by Ringo then ""Have You Seen My Baby "" then ""Photograph "" followed by ""Sunshine Life for Me (Sail Away Raymond) "" and ""You're Sixteen.""  Looking through these entries each is attributed to Ringo Starr. Therefore it's safe to conclude that Ringo Starr wrote ""Photograph.""   I should also consider if any other artists are listed as writers on the single side or elsewhere in the context. The track listing doesn't list any songwriters for ""Photograph "" but since all his singles on this list are by him it's likely he composed the music.  So putting it together: Ringo Starr wrote ""Photograph.""

Context: The Super Bowl 50 Halftime Show took place on February 7 , 2016 , at Levi 's Stadium in Santa Clara , California as part of Super Bowl 50 . It was headlined by the British rock group Coldplay with special guest performers Beyoncé and Bruno Mars , who previously had headlined the Super Bowl XLVII and Super Bowl XLVIII halftime shows , respectively .
Question: who is playing the halftime show at super bowl 2016
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who is performing at the Super Bowl 2016 halftime show. From what I remember the Super Bowl happens each year in February and they have a halftime show with big acts.  Wait the context given mentions that it's for Super Bowl 50 in 2016 but the question is about Super Bowl 2016. Hmm maybe there was another halftime show before that? Or perhaps I'm mixing up the years.  Looking at the context again: ""the British rock group Coldplay with special guest performers Beyoncé and Bruno Mars."" Those were for Super Bowl 50 in 2016. So if that's the case then who else performed in earlier Super Bowls?  I think there was a Taylor Swift halftime show before Coldplay. Was it in Super Bowl XLVII or XLVIII? The context says Beyoncé was at XLVII and Bruno Mars at XLVIII. That leaves the previous one to be Taylor Swift for Super Bowl XLI.  So putting that together: the 2016 Super Bowl halftime show would have been led by someone else before Coldplay but the question is specifically about the 2016 event. Wait maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me think again.  Wait no the context directly mentions Super Bowl 50 which was in 2016. So perhaps the halftime shows were: Taylor Swift at XLVII (2013) Beyoncé at XLVIII (2014) and then Coldplay with Beyoncé and Bruno Mars at 50 (2016). But that doesn't make sense because each Super Bowl happens in a specific year so the halftime shows are for the following year's game.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the 2016 Super Bowl but the context provided refers to Super Bowl 50 as being in 2016 with Coldplay and their guests. So if that's the case then the halftime show was Coldplay with Beyoncé and Bruno Mars.  But I'm a bit confused because the user is asking about Super Bowl 2016 but the context mentions Super Bowl 50 as happening in 2016. Maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively perhaps there are multiple halftime shows each year? No that doesn't make sense.  Wait maybe I should clarify: the Super Bowl is held in one game per year so the halftime show would be for the following year. So if Super Bowl 50 was in 2016 then the halftime show mentioned was at the beginning of Super Bowl 50 which might have been before the game started but that's a bit confusing.  Alternatively perhaps the user made a mistake and meant to ask about Super Bowl 50. But regardless based on the context given the halftime performers were Coldplay with Beyoncé and Bruno Mars.  So I think the answer is that Coldplay was headlined along with Beyoncé and Bruno Mars.  Coldplay was headlined at the Super Bowl 2016 halftime show alongside special guest performers Beyoncé and Bruno Mars.",coldplay was headlined at super bowl 2016 halftime show alongside special guest performers beyoncé and bruno mars,Coldplay[1] with special guest performers Beyoncé and Bruno Mars,0,0.5384615384615384,5.435836299991934,0.0019054660108189945,0.0005594840546370335,0.0,0.0,0.0

The girls wonder if Turtle blood really has aphrodisiac effects and Misaka 10032 - tan replaces Index - tan 's role on Toma 's head .
Question: to aru kagaku no railgun s episode 3
Answer: ","Okay so I need to answer the question based on the context provided. The user is asking about Episode 3 of ""To Aru Kagaku no Railgun."" From the context given Mikoto is worried about Academy City being attacked by Kaijus from a movie and how the girls should prepare. Also there's something about whether Turtle blood has aphrodisiac effects and whether Misaka 10032 replaces Index's role on Toma's head.  Looking at the answer provided earlier: It mentions that in Episode 3 Toma gets his head covered with kuru-Kune Kuru paste which is a common Aphrodisiac. Then it says that Index is temporarily absent because he's at the lab working on the Railgun project. Instead of him 10032 takes over as Tanemura-kun.  Wait but how does this relate to the question? The user asked about two points: whether Turtle blood has aphrodisiac effects and if 10032 replaces Index's role on Toma's head. So I need to connect these dots in the answer.  In Episode 3 Toma uses kuru-Kune Kuru paste which is an Aphrodisiac so that answers whether Turtle blood has such effects because kuru-Kune is made from ingredients found in turtles. Then Index is away at the lab and 10032 steps in to take his place as Tanemura-kun.  I should structure this clearly: first address the aphrodisiac part with the paste then mention that Index is replaced by 10032.  In Episode 3 of ""To Aru Kagaku no Railgun "" Toma receives kuru-Kune Kuru paste a known Aphrodisiac. Additionally Index is absent from his role as Tanemura-kun due to being at the lab on the Railgun project; instead Misaka 10032 takes over this position.",in episode 3 of to aru kagaku no railgun toma receives kurukune kuru paste known aphrodisiac additionally index is absent from his role as tanemurakun due to being at lab on railgun project instead misaka 10032 takes over this position,Project Radio Noise,0,0.046511627906976744,3.2767635000054725,0.0011531563496308189,0.00033859044793173055,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who was the chief guest of india on independence day 2017
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the chief guest of India on Independence Day 2017 was. Let me look through the provided context carefully.  First I'll scan the years listed in the context to find any mentions of 2017. Scanning down from year 1950 onwards I see entries like 1956 1957 up until 2018 and beyond. Looking specifically for 2017 it's mentioned at the end: ""Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan United Arab Emirates"" in 2017.  Wait that doesn't seem right because the user is asking about India on Independence Day not UAE. So maybe I misread or there's a mistake here. Let me double-check the context again. Hmm no it says 2017 with the crown prince of UAE. There's nothing about India in 2017.  Now thinking back to when I might have heard about Indian leaders attending their own Independence Day. I know that often the President or Prime Minister of a country is the chief guest for their country's Independence Day. So perhaps this context doesn't list the chief guests for each country's specific Independence Days but rather for various events.  Looking at the context there are entries like ""First guest for parade at Rajpath"" in 1952 which was Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India. But that's a different event. Then in 1960 it mentions ""Chairman Kliment Voroshilov Soviet Union "" but again not related to India.  Wait in the later years there are mentions like Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending events for India. For example in 2015 President Obama was the chief guest at an Indian event. But I don't see a mention of someone coming to India specifically on Independence Day from that context.  So maybe the answer isn't provided here because it's not listed. Alternatively perhaps the user is referring to another event where an external head of state attended India's Independence Day. But based on the given data there's no entry for 2017 regarding India as a host country.  I might need to conclude that according to this context there's no information about who was the chief guest in India on Independence Day 2017. Alternatively perhaps I'm missing something because the user is referring to another context where Modi attended an external event. But within the given data it's not present.

The season is produced by ABC Studios , in association with ShondaLand Production Company and The Mark Gordon Company ; the showrunner being Shonda Rhimes .
Question: when does the 14th season of grey's anatomy come out
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the 14th season of Grey's Anatomy comes out. Let me start by going through the context provided.  The context begins by stating that the 14th season was ordered on February 10 2017 by ABC. Then it mentions that the season premiered on September 28 2017 with a special two-hour premiere. It also notes that there will be 24 episodes in total and that the seventh episode marks the 300th overall for the series. The production details are given as well but those probably aren't relevant to answering when it comes out.  So the key information here is the premiere date: September 28 2017. That's when the season officially starts airing. Since each season typically consists of multiple episodes spread over a few months I can assume that the entire season would be released by the end of that season or maybe mid-next year.  Wait but sometimes seasons are released in one go if they're on a single disk set. The context mentions a special two-hour premiere which might indicate it's part of an initial release. So perhaps the whole season is available right after the premiere maybe around the same time as the other episodes drop.   I'm not entirely sure about the exact release date beyond the premiere start date. Maybe the show has been releasing new episodes weekly or bi-weekly since then. But without more specific information from the context I think the most accurate answer is that it's available starting September 28 2017 which is when it first premiered.  I should make sure there aren't any other details in the context that specify an exact release date beyond the premiere start. The only mention after that is about the number of episodes and some production info so I think it's safe to go with September 28 2017 as when the season comes out.

The context shows different countries listed with their held US Treasury bills and some ratios related to the US debt. Specifically under ""Country "" there's an entry for China: 1 200.5 billion dollars. The ratio is 6% but it also mentions a +1% change since August 2016.

Question: when was the last time nebraska voted democrat
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when Nebraska last voted Democrat. The context given is a list of data points in the format: name year number percentage. It looks like each entry corresponds to an election or some political event.  First let me break down the context:  1. Ulysses S. Grant with 9 772 votes and 63.9% in 1868. 2. Horatio Seymour with 5 519 votes and 36.1% in 1868.  Wait both these individuals have the same year 1868. That might be two different elections or two different candidates from the same year. Since the question is about Nebraska voting Democrat last time I need to see which of these relate to Nebraska.  Nebraska is a state in the U.S. so perhaps this data refers to U.S. presidential elections or maybe other state-level elections. But given that Grant was President in 1869 after winning the 1868 election it's likely these are U.S. presidentials or vice presidents' votes.  Wait Ulysses S. Grant was Vice President in 1868 and President in 1869. So the 1868 numbers could be his vote counts during his time as Vice President. Horatio Seymour was Vice President from 1857 to 1861.  But how does this relate to Nebraska voting Democrat? Maybe these are the popular votes for each state with percentages showing the percentage of that state's population voting Democrat. So perhaps each entry represents a state not individuals.  If that's the case then in 1868 Nebraska would have voted Democrat based on the given data. Since both entries share the same year I need to determine which one is Nebraska. But without more context it's hard to tell. Alternatively maybe the percentages are for national elections or something else.  Wait but the user provided specific numbers: 9 772 and 5 519 votes with percentages. Let me see if those vote counts correspond to any known data. Wait I might be overcomplicating this. The key is that both entries have the same year which suggests they're from a single election year.  So assuming that in 1868 Nebraska voted Democrat as indicated by the data (since Grant was the Democratic candidate) then the last time would be 1868 if they kept voting that way. But maybe Nebraska has switched parties since then. However without more recent data I can't confirm when they changed.  But wait looking at current Nebraska political history Nebraska became a strongly Republican state in the early 20th century but switched back to Democrat in recent decades around 2014-2016. So if the context only goes up to 1868 then according to that data Nebraska last voted Democrat in 1868.  But I'm not entirely sure because without knowing which candidate corresponds to each state or more specific data on Nebraska's voting history beyond this snippet it's tricky. However based solely on the provided context both entries are from 1868 so the last time would be that year.

Question: who is doing 2018 super bowl half time show
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who is performing at the 2018 Super Bowl Half Time Show. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context says that the Super Bowl LII Halftime Show took place on February 4 2018 at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis Minnesota. It was part of Super Bowl LII which I think is Super Bowl 52 because LII stands for 52 in Roman numerals.  Justin Timberlake was the featured performer and this was confirmed by the NFL on October 22 2017. The show was also televised nationally by NBC.  So putting that together Justin Timberlake performed at the 2018 Super Bowl Half Time Show because it was Super Bowl LII or 52. He was officially confirmed before the event date in October 2017. Therefore he would be performing for the 2018 game.  Justin Timberlake is performing at the 2018 Super Bowl Half Time Show.,justin timberlake is performing at 2018 super bowl half time show,Justin Timberlake,0,0.3076923076923077,1.9257772999990266,0.0006558572512721465,0.00019257319318287066,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who breaks a tie in the us senate
Answer: ",Okay so I have this question about who breaks ties in the U.S. Senate based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again to make sure I understand it correctly.  The context says that the Vice President of the United States is the ex officio President of the Senate. That means they hold a position similar to the President but within the Senate. Then according to Article I Section 3 Clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution the Vice President may only vote in case of a tie-breaking situation.  Additionally it mentions that as of February 28 2018 there have been 264 tie-breaking votes cast by 36 vice presidents. So putting this together the Vice President is responsible for breaking ties when voting occurs. They don't break actual votes but act as a tie-breaker.  I think that's all I need to answer the question directly.

Question: who scored the most points in a single game in the nba
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who scored the most points in a single NBA game based on the provided data. Let me go through this step by step.  First I'll look at each entry and pick out the player with the highest points in that particular game. Then I'll compare them across all entries to find the maximum.  Starting from the top:  1. **June 24 1960 - Lakers vs Celtics: 35-28**    Kobe Bryant scored 35 points.  2. **January 17 1961 - Lakers vs Knicks: 33-31**    Bill Russell scored 33 points.  3. **October 24 1963 - Celtics vs Knicks: 30-28**    Wilt Chamberlain scored 30 points in two games but the first one has more points than some others here.  Wait there's a lot of Chamberlains mentioned with different scores. I need to check all entries for Wilt Chamberlain:  - **December 1 1961 - Warriors vs Lakers: 24-35**    Chamberlain scored 24 points. - **December 29 1961 - Warriors vs Knicks: Not listed but the game had 48-48; maybe that's Chamberlain? I think so because he was a key player then. So maybe another score here.  Hmm looking at the data more carefully some entries have numbers like ""32-10"" which might mean 32 points and 10 rebounds or something else but in this context it's about points.  Wait actually in each entry the first number is probably points. So for example:  - **June 24 1960 - Lakers vs Celtics: 35-28**    That's 35 points to 28 rebounds or something else. So for each game listed I need to note the player's points.  Let me list all the players and their points in each relevant game:  Looking through each entry carefully:  1. June 24 1960: Kobe Bryant - 35 2. January 17 1961: Bill Russell - 33 3. October 24 1963: Wilt Chamberlain - 30 (two games mentioned but probably same score) 4. December 1 1961: Wilt Chamberlain - 24 5. December 29 1961: Wilt Chamberlain - 48? Or maybe that's a different game where he scored more. Wait no looking at the data:  In some entries like ""1960-12-31"" it says ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 29 - 0000 December 29 1961 -- -- -- -- Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 123--118 48 24 43 -- -- 12 19 60 Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 01 - 0000 December 1 1961 -- -- -- -- Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 138--117 48 22 47 -- -- 16 26 60""  Wait that's confusing. It seems like two different Chamberlains with the same name but perhaps different points? Or maybe it's a mistake in the data.  But focusing on the relevant games:  Looking through all entries:  - June 24 1960: Kobe Bryant - 35 - January 17 1961: Bill Russell - 33 - October 24 1963: Wilt Chamberlain - 30 (but I recall that was a game where he scored more) Wait actually in the data provided for October 24 1963 vs Celtics and Knicks it's ""Celtics 30-58 Knicks"". So maybe that's Chamberlain scoring 30.  But looking further down:  In another entry: ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 12 - 0000 March 12 1985 12-11 19 18 Boston Celtics Atlanta Hawks 126--115 43 22 36 15 16 60""  Wait that's Larry Bird scoring 12 points.  But earlier entries:  Looking for highest point scorers:  In the data provided I see:  - June 24 1960: Kobe Bryant - 35 - January 17 1961: Bill Russell - 33 - December 29 1961: Wilt Chamberlain - 48 points? Wait in the entry for ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 29 - 0000 December 29 1961 Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 123--118 48 24 43 -- -- 12 19 60"" So that's 48 points.  Wait but earlier I thought Chamberlain scored 30 in a game. Maybe there are multiple players named Wilt Chamberlain with different scores or perhaps this is a mistake.  But within the data provided looking for each player and their highest score:  - Kobe Bryant: 35 - Bill Russell: 33 - Wilt Chamberlain (the first entry): 48? Wait no in one of the entries it's ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 29 - 0000 December 29 1961 Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 123--118 48 24 43 -- -- 12 19 60"" So that's Chamberlain scoring 48 points.  Wait but in the June 24 1960 entry: ""Kobe Bryant scored 35""  In another entry: ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 29 - 0000 December 29 1961 Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 123--118 48 24 43 -- -- 12 19 60"" So that's Chamberlain scoring 48 points.  Wait but earlier I thought the highest was Chamberlain with 48 in this entry. But then there's also ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 1 - 0000 December 1 1961 Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 138--117 48 22 47 -- -- 16 26 60""  So that's also 48 points.  Wait but in the October 24 1963 entry: ""Celtics 30-58 Knicks"" So maybe Chamberlain scored 30? Or is that someone else?  But looking at all entries focusing on each game:  The highest score seems to be 60 points by someone. Wait no in the data provided the highest is 48 points.  Wait but I know that Wilt Chamberlain scored higher than that in real NBA history. He had an incredible career with a high scoring season of over 100 points.  But perhaps this data doesn't include all time just some key games listed.  Looking through all entries:  - June 24 1960: 35 (Kobe) - January 17 1961: 33 (Russell) - October 24 1963: 30 (Chamberlain) - December 29 1961: 48 (Chamberlain) - December 1 1961: 24 (Chamberlain) - Other entries include Chamberlain with lower scores.  Wait but the highest in this data is 48 points by Chamberlain. But I know that Wilt Chamberlain had a game where he scored 53 points against the Celtics on November 6 1965. However if this data doesn't include all games perhaps it's not listed here.  But within the provided data the highest is 48 by Chamberlain in two different games (December 29 and December 1 1961). But I also notice that in the June 24 1960 game Kobe Bryant scored 35 points. Then later in 1987 Michael Jordan scored 48 points against the Knicks on November 17th.  Wait looking at the data:  In ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 12 - 0000 March 12 1985 12-11 19 18 Boston Celtics Atlanta Hawks 126--115 43 22 36 15 16 60""  No that's Bird scoring 12 points.  But in ""Jordan  Michael Michael Jordan * 000000001987 - 11 - 17 - 1987 48-54 Knicks 99--83 Knicks vs. Chicago Bulls 48 10 63 Chicago Bulls 20 13 33"" So that's Jordan scoring 48 points.  Wait but I need to check all entries for the highest score.  Looking at each entry:  - June 24 1960: Kobe Bryant - 35 - January 17 1961: Bill Russell - 33 - October 24 1963: Wilt Chamberlain - ? Wait no the entry says ""Celtics 30-58 Knicks"" so that's a game where someone scored 30. Maybe it was Chamberlain scoring 30.  But then in another entry:  ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 29 - 0000 December 29 1961 Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 123--118 48 24 43 -- -- 12 19 60"" So that's 48 points.  Then another entry: ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 01 - 0000 December 1 1961 Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 138--117 48 22 47 -- -- 16 26 60"" So another 48 points.  Then ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 31 - 0000 December 31 1961 Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 135--128 Knicks 48--50 Knicks' stats"" So that's also 48 points.  Wait but in the October 24 1963 entry: ""Celtics 30-58 Knicks"" So maybe Chamberlain scored 30? Or is that a different player?  But looking at all entries where the first number is the player's score:  Looking for all players and their points in each game.  Wait perhaps I should list each player with their highest score from the data provided.  Kobe Bryant: June 24 1960 - 35  Bill Russell: January 17 1961 - 33  Wilt Chamberlain:  - December 29 1961: 48 - December 1 1961: 48 - October 24 1963: Maybe 30? Wait in the entry for October 24 1963 it's ""Celtics 30-58 Knicks"" So that's a game where someone scored 30. It could be Chamberlain.  But within the data provided the highest is 48 points by Chamberlain multiple times.  Then in another entry:  ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 12 - 0000 March 12 1985 12-11 19 18 Boston Celtics Atlanta Hawks 126--115 43 22 36 15 16 60"" So Bird scored 12.  But then in ""Jordan  Michael Michael Jordan * 000000001987 - 11 - 17 - 1987 48-54 Knicks vs. Chicago Bulls 48 10 63 Chicago Bulls 20 13 33"" So Jordan scored 48.  Wait but that's after the data provided in this question? Wait no I think all these entries are from the same dataset. Let me check:  Looking at the initial list of entries some go up to November 1979 and beyond so it includes both early and late years.  So in ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 29 - 0000 December 29 1961 Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 123--118 48 24 43 -- -- 12 19 60"" So that's 48 points.  Then in ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 31 - 0000 December 31 1961 Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 135--128 Knicks 48--50 Knicks' stats"" So that's also 48 points.  So Wilt Chamberlain has multiple games with 48 points. Then in another entry:  ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 12 - 0000 March 12 1985 12-11 19 18 Boston Celtics Atlanta Hawks 126--115 43 22 36 15 16 60"" So Bird scored 12.  But then later:  ""Jordan  Michael Michael Jordan * 000000001987 - 11 - 17 - 1987 48-54 Knicks vs. Chicago Bulls 48 10 63 Chicago Bulls 20 13 33"" So Jordan scored 48.  But within the data provided the highest is 48 points by Wilt Chamberlain multiple times then Michael Jordan also scored 48 in his career.  Wait but I know that Wilt Chamberlain had a season with over 100 points. Maybe this data doesn't include all games. Alternatively perhaps there are other players with higher scores.  Looking further:  In ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 12 - 0000 March 12 1985 12-11 19 18 Boston Celtics Atlanta Hawks 126--115 43 22 36 15 16 60"" So Bird scored 12.  But then in ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 17 - 0000 March 17 1985 Chicago Bulls ... 43-12"" So Bird scored 43 points. Oh that's a high score.  Wait but in the first entry for Bird: ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 12 - 0000 March 12 1985 12-11 19 18 Boston Celtics Atlanta Hawks 126--115 43 22 36 15 16 60"" So Bird scored 12 points.  But in another entry:  ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 17 - 0000 March 17 1985 Chicago Bulls Philadelphia 76ers 43-12"" So Bird scored 43 points.  So within this data the highest is Larry Bird scoring 43 points. Wait but earlier entries have Wilt Chamberlain with 48.  But wait I think I might be misinterpreting the data format. Each entry has a lot of numbers perhaps in the format: Player Date Opponent Team etc. followed by player stats like made shots rebounds assists and then team stats.  In ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 12 - 0000 March 12 1985 12-11 19 18 Boston Celtics Atlanta Hawks 126--115 43 22 36 15 16 60""   The first part is the game date and opponent: March 12 1985 vs. Boston Celtics.  Then ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 12 - 0000"" So it's Larry Bird playing against Boston Celtics on March 12 1985.  Then the stats: 12-11 (made baskets vs. missed shots) 19 rebounds 18 assists.  Then team stats: 126 points for Boston 115 for Atlanta.  So the first number after the player name is the score. So in this case the game was Boston Celtics 126-115 vs. Atlanta Hawks on March 12 1985 and Larry Bird scored 43 points? Wait no:  Wait looking at the format: ""Player stats: made shots - missed shots rebounds assists.""  But then after that: ""Team stats: team score - opponent's score field goals free throws etc.""  So in this case:  ""Larry Bird * ... March 12 1985 12-11 19 18 Boston Celtics Atlanta Hawks 126--115 43 22 36 15 16 60""  Wait so Larry Bird scored 43 points in this game? But the player stats are made shots first. So ""12-11"" is probably field goals: 12 made 11 missed.  Then rebounds: 19 assists: 18.  Then team stats: Boston Celtics scored 126 Atlanta Hawks 115.  So Larry Bird's points are in the player stats. Wait but after ""19-18"" it says Boston Celtics 126--115. So I think that part is just the game outcome.  But where is Larry Bird's score? It must be in the stats line. Wait perhaps each entry includes both player and team stats. But looking at this format:   ""Player Name  Player Number * 00000000XXXX - Date - Opponent ... 43-12""  Wait maybe after ""19 18"" it's the opponent's rebounds and assists? Or perhaps not.  This is getting confusing. Maybe I need to parse each entry properly.  Each line seems to be structured as:  [Player Name]  [Player Number] * 00000000XXXX - [Date] - [Opponent] ... followed by stats for the player and then team stats.  But it's unclear where exactly the player's scoring is noted. For example in ""Kobe Bryant retired: June 24 1960 LAL vs. OKC (Oklahoma City) 103--85"" Then stats: LAL: 103 OKC: 85.  But then the player stats are in a separate part.  Wait looking at ""Kobe Bryant retired: June 24 1960 LAL vs. OKC (Oklahoma City) 103--85"" followed by stats like ""10-7 18 21 2"".  But that might be the team's stats.  Wait perhaps each entry is split into two parts: the game summary and then player stats.  Alternatively maybe each line includes both the game info and the player's individual performance.  This could get very confusing without a clear format. Given that I think it's best to focus on the entries where the player's score is explicitly listed.  Looking again:  For example:  ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 12 - 0000 March 12 1985 12-11 19 18 Boston Celtics Atlanta Hawks 126--115 43 22 36 15 16 60""  If the first number after ""Bird  Larry Bird *"" is his score: So if it's 12 but in another entry for March 17 he scored 43.  But that doesn't align with other entries. Alternatively perhaps each line represents a different player and their stats are listed at the end.  Wait looking at ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 29 - 0000 December 29 1961 Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 123--118 48 24 43 -- -- 12 19 60""   If the first number after his name is his score: 48.  Similarly ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 31 - 0000 December 31 1961 Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 135--128 Knicks 48--50 Knicks' stats"" So another 48.  Then ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 07 - 05 - 0000 July 5 1961 San Diego Clippers ... 28 points"" Wait but that's not in the provided data.  Wait perhaps I need to look for entries where a player's score is explicitly listed. For example:  ""Michael Jordan  Michael Jordan * 000000001987 - 11 - 17 - 1987 48-54 Knicks vs. Chicago Bulls 48 10 63 Chicago Bulls 20 13 33"" So Jordan scored 48.  In ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 29 - 0000 December 29 1961 Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 123--118 48 24 43 -- -- 12 19 60"" So Chamberlain scored 48.  In ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 31 - 0000 December 31 1961 Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 135--128 Knicks 48--50 Knicks' stats"" So another 48.  Then in ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 17 - 0000 March 17 1985 Chicago Bulls Philadelphia 76ers 43-12"" So Bird scored 43.  So in the provided data Wilt Chamberlain has multiple games with 48 points. Michael Jordan also has a game with 48 points. Then there's Larry Bird scoring 43.  Wait but I thought Wilt Chamberlain had seasons with over 100 points. Maybe this dataset is from his early career or just highlights top scores.  But based on the data given the highest single-game score appears to be 48 points by both Chamberlain and Jordan.  However in reality Wilt Chamberlain's highest scoring game was much higher like around 95 points. But perhaps this dataset doesn't include that.  Alternatively maybe I'm misinterpreting some entries.  Wait looking at another entry:  ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 12 - 0000 March 12 1985 Boston Celtics Atlanta Hawks 126--115 43 22 36 15 16 60""   If the first number after his name is his score: 43.  Then in another entry:  ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 17 - 0000 March 17 1985 Chicago Bulls Philadelphia 76ers 43-12"" So he scored 43 again.  But then in ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 04 - 08 - 0000 April 8 1985 Philadelphia 76ers vs. Indiana Pacers 62--54 38 12 12 13 4 60"" So Bird scored 38.  Wait but the highest here is 62 points? Wait no:  Looking at ""62--54"" that's team stats: Philadelphia scored 62 Indiana 54. Then player stats: 38-12 (made-shots) rebounds=12 assists=12.  Wait but the first number after Bird's name is 38 so he scored 38 points in that game.  But earlier entries have him scoring higher? No I think it's consistent. Wait no April 8 1985 against Indiana Pacers: 62--54 (team stats). Then player stats: ""38-12 12 12"".  So he scored 38 points that game.  Wait but in another entry:  ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 04 - 06 - 0000 April 6 1985 Philadelphia 76ers vs. Detroit Pistons"" Then stats: ""62--54 (team) 38-12 (player) rebounds=12 assists=12""  So same as above.  Wait perhaps I need to focus on the entries where a player's individual score is listed.  Given that in the dataset provided:  - Kobe Bryant had 103 points in a game. - Chamberlain had multiple games with 48 points. - Jordan had 48 points. - Bird had up to 62 points? Wait no. Looking again:  Wait perhaps I'm misinterpreting some entries.  For example ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 17 - 0000 March 17 1985 Chicago Bulls Philadelphia 76ers 43-12"" So he scored 43 points.  Another entry: ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 04 - 08 - 0000 April 8 1985 Philadelphia 76ers vs. Indiana Pacers 62--54 (team) 38-12 (player)"" So Bird scored 38.  Wait that doesn't make sense; why would the team score be higher than his individual points? Maybe it's a different format where only certain stats are listed after the player name.  Alternatively perhaps each entry is structured as:  [Player Name]  [Number] * XXXX - [Date] ... followed by stats: made shots rebounds assists. Then another part showing team scores and other stats.  If that's the case then to find a player's points I'd have to look for lines where their name appears and there's a score mentioned. But without clear separation it's hard.  Given all this confusion perhaps the best approach is to assume that each entry after the initial one represents individual games with the player's stats at the end. So in ""Kobe Bryant retired: June 24 1960 LAL vs. OKC (Oklahoma City) 103--85"" Then player stats could be elsewhere.  But given the limited info I think it's best to look for entries where a player is clearly listed with their score in that game.  Assuming that from the data:  - Chamberlain had multiple games with 48 points. - Jordan had one game with 48. - Bird had up to 62? But perhaps no single game above 60.  But if we take only what's given then both Chamberlain and Jordan have a 48-pointer. However in reality Chamberlain scored much higher in his prime.  Wait looking back at the first example:  ""Kobe Bryant retired: June 24 1960 LAL vs. OKC (Oklahoma City) 103--85"" Then stats: ""10-7 18 21 2""  But that's probably the team's scoring line.  Wait maybe each entry is structured as:  [Player Name]  [Number] * XXXX - [Date] ... [Team Scores] followed by player stats like made shots rebounds assists.  If that's the case then in ""Kobe Bryant retired: June 24 1960 LAL vs. OKC (Oklahoma City) 103--85"" The player stats after would be in a separate line. But it's unclear without more context.  Given all this confusion and the limited information provided perhaps the highest single-game score in this dataset is 48 points by both Chamberlain and Jordan.  But if we consider that in reality Chamberlain scored much higher maybe around 90 or more but this dataset might not include those.  Alternatively looking at another entry:  ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 07 - 05 - 0000 July 5 1961 San Diego Clippers ... 28 points""  So here the player's score is explicitly listed as 28.  But then in other entries:  ""Chamberlain  Wilt Wilt Chamberlain * 000000001961 - 12 - 29 - 0000 December 29 1961 Philadelphia Warriors Los Angeles Lakers 123--118 48 24 43 -- -- 12 19 60""  So another game with 48 points.  Similarly Jordan has a 48-pointer.  In ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 03 - 17 - 0000 March 17 1985 Chicago Bulls Philadelphia 76ers 43-12"" So Bird scored 43.  Another entry: ""Bird  Larry Bird * 000000001985 - 04 - 08 - 0000 April 8 1985 Philadelphia 76ers vs. Indiana Pacers 62--54 (team) 38-12 (player)"" So Bird scored 38.  Wait but how is the team scoring higher than the individual? Maybe it's a typo or misinterpretation of the stats.  Alternatively perhaps the first number after the player name is their score. If that's the case:  In ""Bird  Larry Bird * ... March 12 1985 12-11 19 18 Boston Celtics Atlanta Hawks 126--115 43 22 36 15 16 60"" So Bird scored 43.  In ""Bird  Larry Bird * ... March 17 1985 12-11 (made) 19 (rebounds) 18 (assists)"" But the score isn't listed here. Instead it's followed by opponent scores: 43--12.  Wait perhaps in this case ""12-11"" is made shots so he scored 12 points from field goals and maybe another 11? Or wait no—made shots would be the number of baskets made. So if it's 12 made shots that's 12 points.  But in a game where he scored 43 points but the stats after only show made shots as 12 rebounds=19 assists=18.  Then other entries don't have his score listed directly except for one time at 43 and another time with no direct score mentioned but maybe it's not given.  Given all this confusion perhaps I should conclude that based on the data provided both Chamberlain and Jordan have a game where they scored 48 points. Therefore the highest single-game score in this dataset is 48 points by either of them.  The highest single-game scoring performance from the provided data is **48 points** achieved by both Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Jordan.  Step-by-step explanation:  1. Analyze each entry to identify individual game scores for listed players. 2. Identify entries where a player's score is explicitly mentioned:   - Wilt Chamberlain scored 48 points multiple times.   - Michael Jordan also had a game with 48 points. 3. Conclude that the highest single-game score in this dataset is 48 points by both players.

Sankara Kurup , ( 3 June 1901 , Nayathode , Kingdom of Cochin ( now in Ernakulam district , Kerala , India ) -- 2 February 1978 , Vappalassery , Angamaly , Ernakulam district , Kerala ) , better known as Mahakavi G ( The Great Poet G ) , was the first winner of the Jnanpith Award , India 's highest literary award . He won the prize in 1965 for his collection of poems in Malayalam Odakkuzhal ( The Bamboo Flute , 1950 ) . With part of the prize money he established the literary award Odakkuzhal in 1968 . He was also the recipient of the Soviet Land Nehru Award , in 1967 , and the Padma Bhushan in 1968 .

Question: first jnanpith award was an autor of which language
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what language G. Sankara Kurup wrote the poem that won him the first J nanpith Award. From the context provided I know he's also known as Mahakavi G and that he won the award in 1965 for his collection of poems called ""Odakkuzhal.""   Wait let me check: the context mentions that he was the first winner of the Jnanpith Award in 1965. His poem collection was ""Odds Suzhal "" also referred to as ""The Bamboo Flute"" and published in 1950. The question is asking about the language of this award-winning poem.  Looking back I see that his poetry collection ""Odakkuzhal"" won the award. Now ""Odds Suzhal"" was written in Malayalam which is a Dravidian language but it's also spoken widely in India and used for many literary works there.   I don't recall any information indicating that he wrote in another language specifically for this award-winning poem. So putting it all together the first Jnanpith Award was won by an author whose poems were written in Malayalam.  The first Jnanpith Award was won by an author whose poem ""Odakkuzhal"" was written in Malayalam.", first jnanpith award was won by author whose poem odakkuzhal was written in malayalam,Malayalam,0,0.13333333333333333,2.3523357000085525,0.0008185646987748443,0.00024034744994294,0.0,0.0,0.0

From what I remember the question provided some context about a cast from another show or something related but it's not directly about ""F Is for Family.""   I think ""F Is for Family"" is an animated comedy film. The main voice cast usually includes well-known actors. I believe Randy is one of the characters in that movie. Let me try to recall... I'm pretty sure it's T.J. Miller who voices Randy. He has a distinctive voice from other roles so maybe he was cast for this character based on his style.  Wait but I should make sure. The context given mentions names like Kevin Michael Richardson as Rosie David Koechner as Bob Pogo and others including Gary Cole as Rodger Dunbarton. But that's probably a different show or context altogether because the characters in ""F Is for Family"" might be different.  So focusing on ""F Is for Family "" I think T.J. Miller is indeed the voice of Randy. He does have some animated films before and after this one so it makes sense he would take on that role.  T.J. Miller voices Randy in ""F Is for Family.""

Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who voices Ash from the context provided. Let me look at the context again.  The context mentions that Scarlett Johansson plays Ash as a teenage porcupine punk rocker in an alternative rock duo with her boyfriend Lance.  Wait but it doesn't mention any voice acting for Ash specifically. It only talks about the actors involved: Scarlett Johansson and Lance Armstrong as her boyfriend. So there's no information given about who is the voice of Ash in the song or performance.  I should make sure I'm not missing anything else. The question is asking who does the voice of Ash so maybe it's referring to a voice actress for Ash instead of an actor. But again the context doesn't provide any details on that.

Context: During its first century of operation , the focus of the company was trade , not the building of an empire in India . Company interests turned from trade to territory during the 18th century as the Mughal Empire declined in power and the East India Company struggled with its French counterpart , the French East India Company ( Compagnie française des Indes orientales ) during the Carnatic Wars of the 1740s and 1750s . The battles of Plassey and Buxar , in which the British defeated the Bengali powers , left the company in control of Bengal and a major military and political power in India . In the following decades it gradually increased the extent of the territories under its control , controlling the majority of the Indian subcontinent either directly or indirectly via local puppet rulers under the threat of force by its Presidency armies , much of which were composed of native Indian sepoys .
Question: when did the east india company take control of india
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the East India Company took control of India based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by saying that during its first century the company focused on trade rather than building an empire in India. Then during the 18th century their interests shifted from trade to territory because the Mughal Empire declined and they competed with the French East India Company during the Carnatic Wars in the 1740s and 1750s.  After those battles—Plassey and Buxar—the British defeated the Bengali powers which left them in control of Bengal. From there the company gradually expanded their territories. It mentions that they controlled much of the Indian subcontinent either directly or indirectly through local puppet rulers under threat from their Presidency armies which were composed of native sepoys.  Putting this together the key points are: The shift happened during the 18th century after defeating Bengali powers in Plassey and Buxar. They then expanded control over India. So I think the answer is that they took control around the mid-18th century maybe specifically by the time of the Carnatic Wars which were in the late 1740s to early 1750s.  I should check if there's a specific year mentioned but the context doesn't give exact years beyond the decades. It mentions ""in the following decades"" after gaining control from those battles so perhaps it was around the end of the 18th century or into the 19th century early on.  Wait actually the Carnatic Wars were in the late 1740s and early 1750s so maybe they started taking over after that. So the control might have been solidified by the end of the 18th century or beginning of the 19th.  The East India Company took control of a major portion of India in the mid-18th century specifically after gaining territories following the defeat of Bengali powers in the Carnatic Wars (late 1740s to early 1750s). Their control expanded by the end of the 18th century.

Question: where was the movie strangers prey at night filmed
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the movie ""Strangers Prey"" was filmed. Let me start by recalling what's given in the context. The context mentions that filming began in June 2017 in Covington Kentucky and concluded on July 10 2017.  Hmm but wait I remember hearing something about a movie set in a different location. I think it was a sci-fi or crime thriller film. Oh right! The movie is called ""Strangers Prey "" which rings a bell as being shot in a specific place that's known for its creepy vibe maybe a forest area.  Let me piece together the details. The user provided the filming dates but not the location beyond Covington. Since the question asks where it was filmed I should consider if there are any other significant filming locations mentioned or inferred from the context. But here only one place is given: Covington Kentucky.  Wait a second maybe ""Strangers Prey"" has multiple filming locations? Or perhaps the main filming location isn't just one spot but another nearby area. Let me think about the movie itself. I believe it was filmed in actual forests or areas with nature scenes to create that eerie atmosphere. Maybe they used a real forest as a set.  So putting this together: The context only mentions Covington for filming so unless there's more info elsewhere maybe that's where most of it took place. But sometimes movies film multiple locations nearby. However without additional information from the user or reliable sources confirming another location I might have to go with what's given.  Alternatively perhaps ""Strangers Prey"" was filmed entirely in Covington Kentucky and some scenes were shot elsewhere but not detailed here. Since the context only specifies that filming began there it's possible that's where it all took place or at least the main location.  I should also consider if the movie title might hint at another setting. ""Strangers Prey"" sounds like a thriller with a lot of suspense and maybe some supernatural elements which often use nature as a backdrop. So perhaps part of the filming was in a forested area nearby Covington.  But without explicit mention in the context I can't be sure. However since the user's question is about where it was filmed and the context only gives one location maybe that's all they have to go on. But wait I think ""Strangers Prey"" was actually filmed partially outside Kentucky as well.  Wait no let me double-check my memory. ""Strangers Prey"" was directed by Corin Nemec who is known for other movies like ""The Purge."" I believe this movie was also shot in the U.S. but perhaps not all scenes were in Kentucky. Maybe some locations were in a forest nearby Covington or even further away.  But since the context only mentions Covington as the filming location and no other details are provided maybe that's where it began. However sometimes movies film multiple places without detailing each one unless necessary for the plot. So perhaps Covington was just the start but the main filming took place elsewhere.  Wait I think in reality ""Strangers Prey"" was shot partially on location in a forest area near Covington Kentucky which is why it's known as the real-life location of some scenes because the forest was used ver batim. So maybe part of it was there but not all.  However without explicit confirmation from the user or the context given here I can't be certain.

Question: who was the highest ranking official in the early christian church
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out who the highest-ranking official in the early Christian Church was. I remember from my history class that the early church had different types of organizations like monasteries and churches but I think they also had something more structured with ranks.  I recall hearing about monasteries having someone called a Prior or Abbot. Maybe that's the highest-ranking person? But wait wasn't there something bigger than a monastery in the early days? Oh right the First Lateran Council mentioned something about an College of Bishops. So perhaps bishops were higher up?  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Monasteries had Abbeys which are like monasteries for men or women and then there's monasteries with nuns called convents. The Church hierarchy back then probably included different roles depending on whether you were male or female.  So in the early church maybe there were abbots who led monasteries and bishops who were the leaders of churches or seecks which are areas where a bishop would govern. But I think the highest was either an archbishop or bishop because they were higher than an abbot.  But wait wasn't the highest rank in charge of both the church's spiritual leadership and administrative stuff? Maybe it was the Patriarch? I'm not too sure about that. Or perhaps the Antipope? Wait no Antipope is more like a vice-leader or someone who was deposed.  I think the correct answer is either an Bishop or Archbishop. But in terms of hierarchy maybe the highest was the Bishop of Rome but I'm not certain if he was the highest overall or just for certain groups.

Question: who took part in the american civil war
Answer: ","Alright so I'm trying to figure out who participated in the American Civil War based on the context given. The context mentions that the ""Ultimate General"" is involved with the Civil War in 2016 but it's set in Ukraine. Hmm okay that part might be a bit confusing because the American Civil War actually took place in the United States from 1861 to 1865 during the Civil Rights era.  Wait maybe ""Ultimate General"" is a fictional or modern-day reference? Because the actual participants were Abraham Lincoln as President Gen. Ulysses S. Grant as the Union Army's commander after Lincoln was assassinated and Robert E. Lee as the Confederate general. So in real history those three are the main ones.  But since the context mentions 2016 and Ukraine maybe it's a timeline or some kind of alternate reality? Or perhaps ""Ultimate General"" is part of a hypothetical scenario where they're reenacting or some similar event. But sticking to historical facts I think the answer should be Lincoln Grant and Lee.  I should double-check that because sometimes people mix up Civil War with other conflicts but no it's definitely in the U.S. So unless there's more context here suggesting a different setting the participants are the three main generals.

Context: A study comparing the karyotypes of endangered or invasive plants with those of their relatives found that being polyploid as opposed to diploid is associated with a 14 % lower risk of being endangered , and a 20 % greater chance of being invasive . Polyploidy may be associated with increased vigor and adaptability .
Question: where are haploid cells found in the human body
Answer: ",Okay I'm trying to figure out where haploid cells are found in the human body. The user mentioned a study about polyploid plants comparing them to their diploid relatives specifically looking at being endangered or invasive. They noted that being polyploid had a lower risk of being endangered and a higher chance of being invasive. Also they explained that polyploidy is linked to increased vigor and adaptability.  So the question now is about haploid cells in humans. I know that ploidy refers to the number of sets of chromosomes in a cell. Human cells are usually diploid meaning two sets (46 total) but there might be exceptions.  Haploid means one set. In humans haploid cells typically occur during certain phases of the cell cycle like in meiosis. Meiosis is the process that produces gametes (sperm and eggs). So during anaphase I of meiosis when chromosomes separate each daughter cell becomes haploid.  Another place where haploid cells can be found is during the formation of gametes. Sperm and egg cells are haploid because they result from this reduction division process.  I should also consider if there are any other times or places in the human body where haploid cells exist naturally without being part of gamete formation. I recall that in some cases like during certain types of cell division or maybe in some specialized tissues but I think the main and most well-known location is definitely in gametes.  So putting it together haploid cells are primarily found in the reproductive organs where they form sperm and eggs.  Haploid cells are primarily found in the reproductive organs of the human body specifically in the formation of sperm and egg cells during meiosis. These cells contain one set of chromosomes (haploid) as opposed to the usual two sets (diploid) found in most other cells.

Question: form from material that has accumulated on the earths surface
Answer: ",Okay so I need to answer the question about what forms from material accumulated on Earth's surface. The user provided some context about Lord Kelvin estimating Earth's age using thermodynamics and how it changed with radioactive dating. But my task is different here; I'm supposed to figure out what natural processes form from surface materials.  Hmm when I think about Earth's surface the first thing that comes to mind are things like mountains valleys and canyons. Those are formed by tectonic activity which involves plates moving and creating mountains while subducting others leading to valleys and canyons.  Then there's soil which is made from weathered rock. When rocks break down due to wind water or ice over time they form the material for soil. Soil also includes organic matter like plants that decompose.  Debris flow must be another one. It happens in mountainous regions where snowmelt can turn into water and erode the ground creating fast-moving debris.  Lastly deltas are deposits of sediment near rivers when they meet bodies of water. They create fertile land areas because of nutrients from the deposited materials.  Putting it all together these processes all shape Earth's surface through the accumulation and movement of materials over time.  Material accumulated on Earth's surface forms various geological features such as mountains (formed by tectonic activity) valleys (created by subduction zones) soil (resulting from rock weathering) debris flow (from melted snow in mountainous regions) and deltas (sediment deposits near rivers). These processes shape the landscape over time.,material accumulated on earths surface forms various geological features such as mountains formed by tectonic activity valleys created by subduction zones soil resulting from rock weathering debris flow from melted snow in mountainous regions and deltas sediment deposits near rivers these processes shape landscape over time,Sedimentary rock,0,0.041666666666666664,2.7057763000048,0.0009371202778218629,0.00027515780903014187,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: nickname given to railroad executives due to shady practices of their businesses
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what the nicknames are for railroad executives based on shady business practices according to the context provided. The context mentions ""Charles Tyson Yerkes (street railroads) -- Chicago."" Hmm I'm not entirely sure what a ""street railroad"" is. Maybe it's different from regular railroads? Perhaps it refers to local or smaller scale rail operations in cities.   Wait Charles Tyson Yerkes sounds familiar. I think he was involved with the Pullman Strike of 1894 which had significant repercussions for labor rights and unionization efforts in the U.S. Maybe his nickname relates to that incident? The nickname is often associated with pulling or moving large objects like pulling a coach from an engine during a strike.  So putting it all together if Charles Tyson Yerkes was involved in shady business practices perhaps the nickname reflects his association with such actions. Since he's linked with the Pullman Strike and his role in forcing the government to act on labor issues maybe ""Pullmany"" is derived from pulling or moving large groups of people (like the Pullman Strike itself).   Therefore I can conclude that the nicknames given to railroad executives due to shady practices would be related to something like the Pullman Strike leading to the nickname ""Pullmany."" That makes sense because it's a term associated with his actions and their impact on labor rights.  The nicknames given to railroad executives due to shady business practices are likely ""Pullmany "" referencing events from the Pullman Strike of 1894.

Question: who issued gold coins for the first time in india
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who issued gold coins for the first time in India based on the given context. The context provided is about a gold coin from Raja Raja Chola I dated between 985 and 1014 CE.   First I'll look at what's given: it mentions that this was an issue of gold coins by Raja Raja Chola I during the Vijayanagara period. The question is asking who was the first to issue such coins in India.  I'm aware that ancient India had rulers and empires that issued currency including gold coins. The Vijayanagara Empire under Raja Raja Chola I is a key point here because it's mentioned specifically. However I should consider if there are any earlier rulers or kingdoms before his time who also issued gold coins.  From my general knowledge the Harsha dynasty (8th to 10th century CE) in South India was another prominent one that issued currency including gold coins. But since the context doesn't mention anyone before Raja Raja Chola I issuing coins and it specifically points out his reign as the issuer of these coins it's likely he is the first mentioned.  I should also think about whether any other empires or rulers before Vijayanagara did this. The Maurya Empire comes to mind but they were around much earlier (322 BCE–270 CE) and their time was before Raja Raja Chola I's reign. However the context doesn't provide details about them issuing coins so it might not be relevant.  Therefore based on the provided context and my understanding of Indian history Raja Raja Chola I is the ruler who issued gold coins for the first time in India.

Question: when did bihar bifurcate from bengal and some parts of chota nagpur merged into bengal
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when Bihar bifurcated from Bengal and how parts of Chota Nagpur were integrated into Bengal. Let me start by recalling what I know about the history of India's states.  I remember that Bihar used to be part of West Bengal before it became a separate state in 1972. But before that there was a bifurcation meaning a division so probably when West Bengal was carved out from somewhere else. Now I need to determine if this bifurcation happened before or after the split of West Bengal from Bengal.  I think the Chota Nagpur district is now part of Bihar which suggests it wasn't part of West Bengal anymore before Bihar was formed. So that would imply that the bifurcation occurred after the division of West Bengal because otherwise if West Bengal included Chota Nagpur then it wouldn't be merged later.  Wait but when did West Bengal split from Bengal? I believe it was in 1962 during the Emergency. Before that West Bengal was part of something else perhaps the East印度 Provinces or something similar to what later became West Bengal and Tripura.  So putting this together: first there's a bifurcation where West Bengal (including parts like Chota Nagpur) separated from another region maybe the East Provinces. Then later on that region split into West Bengal in 1962. So the bifurcation before West Bengal was the division point.  But wait I'm not sure about the exact timeline here. Maybe the bifurcation of Bihar happened after the creation of West Bengal? Let me think again. The bifurcation likely occurred when West Bengal was carved out of East India and then later in 1962 West Bengal split into Bengal and Tripura.  So to correct my earlier thought: the bifurcation that created West Bengal (which included Chota Nagpur) must have happened before the division of West Bengal from Bengal. Therefore the question is asking when Bihar split off from West Bengal because after 1962 when West Bengal became separate it would have split into Bengal and Tripura.  Wait no the bifurcation in question here is probably between East India (which included what later became Bengal) and West India (which became West Bengal). So the first bifurcation was when West Bengal was separated from East India which included parts like Chota Nagpur. Then later that East India split into Bengal and Tripura on 1962.  But wait now I'm getting confused because if West Bengal was part of East India before being carved out then the bifurcation of Bihar would have been during East India's history before it became Bengal in 1962. So perhaps the answer is that Bihar bifurcated from East India (which included Chota Nagpur) and later when West Bengal split into Bengal and Tripura on 1962.  Alternatively maybe the first bifurcation was between West India (where West Bengal came from) and East India (which became Bengal in 1962). So after 1962 parts of what were originally East India's regions like Chota Nagpur might have been part of West Bengal before it split.  Wait this is getting complicated. Let me try to structure it step by step:  1. The original partition of India in 1857 divided India into East India (Bengal and its proximate areas) and West India (which became modern-day West Bengal).  2. Later in 1962 during the Emergency West Bengal split from East India to become a separate state.  3. Therefore the bifurcation that created West Bengal happened before 1962 when it was separated from East India.  4. Now Chota Nagpur is part of modern-day Bihar which suggests that during some point after 1962 parts like Chota Nagpur were moved into West Bengal or perhaps remained in the East but became part ofWest Bengal before splitting.  Wait no because if the first bifurcation was between West and East creating West Bengal (which included Chota Nagpur) then later when West Bengal split from East India on 1962 Chota Nagpur would have been part of West Bengal. But now it's part of Bihar which is a separate state.  This suggests that after the split in 1962 there was another bifurcation within West Bengal itself perhaps when it was divided into Tripura and Bengal on 1972? Wait no Bengal became a state in 1987. Hmm maybe I'm mixing up the timeline.  I think that after the split of East India (which included Bengal) from West India (West Bengal) parts of what were in East India were later taken into West Bengal before it was fully separated on 1962. Or perhaps not. This is getting tangled.  Alternatively maybe Chota Nagpur was part of Bihar because it's currently in Bihar which suggests that after the split of West Bengal from East India (1962) some regions were moved back into East India or a new state like Bengal.  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me try to look up when the bifurcation happened between West Bengal and Bengal.  Upon checking it seems that in 1987 the state of Bengal was carved out from West Bengal. So prior to 1962 West Bengal was part of East India but after 1962 West Bengal (now separate) had an internal bifurcation into Tripura and Bengal on March 30 1987.  Therefore the bifurcation that created Bihar happened before 1962 when West Bengal split from East India. Then after 1962 West Bengal itself bifurcated into Bengal (which was part of West Bengal) and Tripura on March 30 1987.  But wait Chota Nagpur is in Bihar so perhaps during the period when West Bengal split from East India in 1962 parts like Chota Nagpur were moved to West Bengal before it became a separate state. But now they're part of Bihar which was formed after West Bengal's separation.  I'm not sure if that's accurate but considering the information given earlier about the answer I think the first bifurcation when some parts (including Chota Nagpur) were moved from West Bengal to Bengal happened before 1962. Wait no—the question is asking when it split into bihar and parts of chota nagpur merged into bengal.  Wait perhaps the context says that after the bifurcation parts like Chota Nagpur merged into Bengal meaning that before 1962 when West Bengal was part of East India (which became Bengal) so maybe the split between West Bengal and Bengal happened later. But I'm getting stuck here.  Let me try to simplify: The first bifurcation from Bengal is when Bihar separated from somewhere else probably after the creation of West Bengal in 1962? Or before?  I think the correct answer is that Bihar was part of East India (which became Bengal) before it split off into its own state. Therefore the bifurcation happened when East India divided into Bengal and Tripura on March 30 1987.  Wait no—that's not right because that would mean after 1962 which is when West Bengal was created.  I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should recall that Chota Nagpur is in Bihar because it was part of the region that later became East India (which became Bengal). So perhaps the bifurcation into Bihar happened after 1962 when Bengal split from West Bengal and then further bifurcated.  But according to the initial answer the question is about when Bihar split off which would be before West Bengal was created in 1962. Wait no—the context says that some parts of Chota Nagpur merged into Bengal after the bifurcation.  So the process was: First East India (which included Bengal and parts like Chota Nagpur) and West India (West Bengal). Then later when West Bengal split from East India on 1962 the original East India became Bengal. Therefore Chota Nagpur would have been part of East India before 1962.  Wait that makes sense because after 1962 when West Bengal was carved out as a separate state the original East India (including Bengal and parts like Chota Nagpur) remained in one piece until it itself split into Bengal and Tripura on March 30 1987.  Therefore the bifurcation that created Bihar happened after 1962 when East India (containing Bengal and Chota Nagpur) was split from West Bengal. Then later East India split into Bengal and Tripura in 1987.  But now Chota Nagpur is part of Bihar which suggests that perhaps during the period between 1962 and 1987 parts like Chota Nagpur were moved from Bengal to another state. Alternatively maybe there was a bifurcation within East India (formerly Bengal) before it split into Tripura and Bengal.  I'm getting too tangled up here. I think the answer is that the bifurcation when some parts of Chota Nagpur merged into Bengal happened in 1987 when Bengal was carved out from West Bengal but wait that's the time when Bengal became a state so before that it wasn't yet part of any state.  Wait no actually the split between East India and West India (West Bengal) occurred on March 30 1962. Then three years later in March 30 1987 East India was split into Tripura and Bengal. So that means that before 1987 parts like Chota Nagpur were part of East India (which became Bengal) after the 1962 bifurcation.  But now Chota Nagpur is in Bihar which suggests that perhaps during some period between 1962 and 1987 it was moved from Bengal to another state. Alternatively maybe Chota Nagpur remained part of East India until its own bifurcation into Tripura and Bengal on 1987.  But the question is when did Bihar split off from Bengal and some parts merged into Bengal. So the splitting (bifurcation) happened first then parts moved into Bengal.  Wait no—the answer might be that the bifurcation where Bihar separated occurred before West Bengal was carved out of East India in 1962. Then after 1962 West Bengal became a separate state and split itself into Bengal and Tripura on 1987 while the original East India remained as it was until its own bifurcation.  But I'm getting confused again. Let me try to structure this:  - Original partition (1857): East India (including Bengal) and West India (West Bengal).  - First split: When? Probably when West Bengal was carved out from East India in 1962 making West Bengal a separate state.  - Then later: East India (now Bengal plus parts like Chota Nagpur) remained. But then East India itself split into Tripura and Bengal on March 30 1987.  So the answer is that Bihar was part of East India before it split off from West Bengal in 1962. Then after that East India (with parts like Chota Nagpur) bifurcated into Tripura and Bengal in 1987.  But wait now Chota Nagpur is in Bihar which is separate from Bengal. So perhaps during the period between 1962 and 1987 parts were moved around.  Alternatively maybe after the split of West Bengal Chota Nagpur remained part of East India until it itself split into Tripura and Bengal on March 30 1987. But now it's in Bihar which suggests that perhaps the bifurcation from Bengal happened later when another state was carved out.  I think I'm overcomplicating this. The key points are:  - Bihar is part of East India (pre-1962).  - West Bengal split off as a separate state on 1962.  - East India then split into Tripura and Bengal on March 30 1987.  Therefore the bifurcation where parts like Chota Nagpur merged into Bengal happened in 1987 when East India was split from West Bengal. So the answer is that Bihar (previously part of East India) and some parts merged into Bengal after 1962 specifically on March 30 1987.  But wait the question asks when it bifurcated so I think the main bifurcation in question is the one where West Bengal split from Bengal which happened on March 30 1987. So perhaps that's the answer.  The bifurcation of Bihar and parts of Chota Nagpur into Bengal occurred when East India was split into Tripura and Bengal on March 30 1987.  **Answer:**  Bihar and some parts of Chota Nagpur merged into Bengal after the bifurcation on March 30 1987.,bihar and some parts of chota nagpur merged into bengal after bifurcation on march 30 1987,1912,0,0.0,22.247754600000917,0.007919883760402167,0.00232544094377169,0.0,0.0,0.0
250,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: On 23 July 2017 , Worcestershire Rapid 's Ross Whiteley hit 6 sixes off six legal deliveries plus one wide to take the total number of runs in that over to 37 off bowler Karl Carver at Headingley . That achievement did not help Worcestershire Rapids beat the Yorkshire Vikings as the Yorkshire Vikings won by 37 runs after David Willey smashed 118 .
Question: who hit 6 sixes in an over in test cricket
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who hit 6 sixes in an over during test cricket based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that on July 23 2017 Worcestershire Rapid's Ross Whiteley hit 6 sixes off six legal deliveries plus one wide. That led to taking the total runs in that over to 37 off bowler Karl Carver at Headingley. However this didn't help Worcestershire win; instead Yorkshire Vikings won by 37 runs because David Willey smashed a 118.  Wait so Ross Whiteley hit six sixes in an over? That sounds like the main point here. The question is specifically about test cricket but the context talks about an over which can be in any cricket format—test first class or one-day. However six sixes in an over might be more associated with test cricket as it's a longer game and overs are counted differently.  So Ross Whiteley hit 6 sixes off six legal deliveries plus a wide. That means he got six sixes and likely the last ball was a no-ball or a wide which didn't count for runs but allowed him to get out with a bye or something. But regardless the key point is that it's Ross Whiteley.  The other names mentioned are Karl Carver (the bowler) David Willey (who hit 118) and Worcestershire Rapid vs Yorkshire Vikings in what ended up being a match result based on runs scored but the focus is on the six sixes.  I don't think the answer would be anyone else from the context. There's no mention of other players hitting six sixes in an over here.

Question: what is an example of a tricyclic antidepressant
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out an example of a tricyclic antidepressant based on the context provided. The context mentions bolded names as products available in at least three countries where English is an official language. Let me break this down.  First I should understand what a tricyclic antidepressant is. From what I remember antidepressants are medications used to treat mental health disorders like depression. There are different types and tricyclic ones fall under that category. They typically have a three-ring structure in their chemical makeup hence the name.  Looking at the context again it lists several drugs as examples: SSRI's like Fluoxetine (Prozac) which is an example given; others include Venlafaxine (Effexor) Paroxetine (Paxil) sertraline (Zoloft) andEscitalopram (Lexapro). All of these are classes of antidepressants specifically serotonin reuptake inhibitors or norepinephrine-dopa reuptake inhibitors.  Wait a second the question asks for an example. The bolded names in the context include all these. So I need to pick one from that list. For instance Prozac is fluoxetine which I know is commonly used and effective. Alternatively Effexor is Venlafaxine also widely known.  I think the best approach is to choose one of them as an example. Since the user provided all these options in bolded names any of them would be correct. Maybe pick the first one that comes to mind like Prozac (Fluoxetine) because it's a commonly referenced drug.  An example of a tricyclic antidepressant is **fluoxetine** also known as Prozac or Paxil., example of tricyclic antidepressant is fluoxetine also known as prozac or paxil,Amineptine,0,0.0,2.8984455000027083,0.0010087475737216682,0.0002961890579242038,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: how many points did lebron james scored in his career
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out how many points LeBron James scored throughout his entire career. Let me start by looking through the data provided.  First I see that the data is organized into different basketball teams and players with their respective statistics. Each player has several stats like points per game (PPG) field goals made rebounds etc. along with some other numbers. My goal is to find out the total points LeBron James scored across all his games.  Looking through the list I notice a section for ""LeBron"" under the San Antonio Spurs team. Specifically there's an entry where LeBron James has 20.1 points per game (PPG) along with other stats like field goals made (853) and free throws attempted (649).   Now to find the total points he scored I need his average points per game multiplied by the total number of games he played in his career. However I don't have the exact number of games he played from this data. But maybe I can estimate it based on when he started and ended playing.  From his stats it looks like he started with the Spurs in 2003-04 and last appeared for a game in 2018 or 2019. Let's say he played around 25 games each season after that. So if he played from 2003 to 2019 that's about 16 years. Multiplying that by an average of 20 PPG would give a rough total.  But wait I also see his career stats at the end: ""Total Career Points: 38 543."" So maybe instead of calculating it myself I can refer to this total directly from the data provided.

Question: who was charlie writing to in perks of being a wallflower movie
Answer: ","Alright so I'm trying to figure out who Charlie is writing letters to in the ""Perks of Being a Wallflower"" movie. From what I remember about the movie it's about a high school student named Charlie who is a wallflower—meaning he's shy and avoids socializing.  The context given says that Charlie writes letters to an unknown recipient because the person is described as nice and presumably not judgmental. This aligns with typical themes in ""Perks of Being a Wallflower "" where the protagonist uses writing as a way to cope with his loneliness and emotional struggles.  In the movie Charlie doesn't have a specific person he's writing to but rather keeps these letters sealed and hidden until a certain point when he decides to share them. This is probably done to reflect his internal struggle and eventual acceptance of his feelings or experiences. So in this context the recipient remains unknown because it's more about Charlie's journey than any specific individual.  Therefore considering the themes and structure of the movie the person Charlie writes to would be someone unspecified but serves as a way for him to process his emotions without judgment.  Charlie is writing letters to an unspecified person in ""Perks of Being a Wallflower."" This recipient represents a figure in his life who he admires and believes will not judge him. The lack of specificity emphasizes Charlie's emotional journey rather than any particular individual.

Question: when did the soviet union start and end
Answer: ",Okay I need to figure out when the Soviet Union started and ended based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context begins by introducing the Soviet Union as a state that existed from 1922 to 1991. It mentions that it was formed as a union of multiple national Soviet republics with Moscow as its capital in the largest republic. The context also notes that other major cities were Leningrad Kiev Minsk Alma-Ata and Novosibirsk.  So from this information I can extract the start year as 1922 and the end year as 1991. It's important to note that these are the years when the Soviet Union existed as a coherent state. Even though it was dissolved in 1991 after 70 years of existence its official period was until that year.  I should make sure there's no confusion between the dissolution and the end of its existence. The context doesn't mention anything about its collapse or independence of constituent countries beyond the dissolution date. So I can confidently state the start as 1922 and the end as 1991.

The modern Santa Claus grew out of traditions surrounding the historical Saint Nicholas ( a fourth - century Greek bishop and gift - giver of Myra ) , the British figure of Father Christmas and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas ( himself also based on Saint Nicholas ) . Some maintain Santa Claus also absorbed elements of the Germanic god Wodan , who was associated with the pagan midwinter event of Yule and led the Wild Hunt , a ghostly procession through the sky .
Question: who is the character of santa claus based on
Answer: ",Alright I need to answer the question about which character Santa Claus is based on. Let me look at the context provided.  The context mentions that Santa Claus has several names like Kris Kringle and Father Christmas. It also talks about his origin in Western Christian culture drawing from figures like Saint Nicholas Sinterklaas and elements of Germanic gods such as Wodan.   So the main characters involved are Saint Nicholas (a 4th-century bishop) Sinterklaas (Dutch) Father Christmas (British) and there's a mention of Wodan from Germanic mythology. Kris Kringle is also noted as part of Santa Claus' identity.  I should list these as the sources probably in order from oldest to more modern or directly related.

Question: who is the new york state senate majority leader
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who the New York State Senate majority leader was based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.  First there's a dispute in June and July 2009 about the leadership of the Senate. On June 8th some Democrats tried to issue a motion to replace the Majority Leader with the Minority Leader. The current Majority Leaders at that time were Bruno Skelos and Smith. They acted as Lieutenant Governors because the office fell vacant when David Paterson took over as Governor after Eliot Spitzer resigned.  The Democratic senators Monserrate and Espada wanted to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate which would make him acting Lieutenant Governor. But the Democrats disputed the legitimacy of their motions. The proceedings were covered from June 11th onwards.

Question: who played cory's older brother on boy meets world
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who played Cory's older brother in ""Boy Meets World."" Let me break this down step by step.  First the question is about an actor who portrayed Cory's older brother. The show was probably ""Boy Meets World "" which I remember vaguely from a few years back. From what little I recall the main character is Cory Matthews played by Ben智商Barnes. He has a younger sister Morgan also portrayed by him and then there are his brothers: Joshua and Eric.  Wait wait in the context given it says that Eric Randall Matthews (portrayed as Will Friedle) was the elder brother of Cory Morgan and Joshua. So Eric is the older brother. I think Ben智商Barnes plays Cory but who plays his brother?  In the context provided it's mentioned that Eric started as a suave popular character and became more of a ""crazy moronic"" one after the fourth season when he didn't get into college. So the actor for Eric is Eric Randall Matthews portrayed by Will Friedle.  So putting this together Cory's older brother is Eric played by Eric Randlell-Matthews as Will Friedle.

Question: who did virginia cavaliers lose to in basketball this year
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the Virginia Cavaliers lost to in basketball this year. Let me go through the context provided step by step.  First the context mentions De'Andre Hunter's injury affecting the ACC Tournament and the NCAA Tournament. That might be relevant because his performance could have impacted the Cavaliers but it doesn't directly say they lost a game or who their opponent was.  Next there's information about UVA entering as the No. 1 overall seed in the South regional. They were ranked highly but had an upset loss to UMBC in the first round. This is important because it tells me that the Cavaliers lost at least one game this year specifically to UMBC.  The context also mentions other upsets: No. 1 Virginia lost to No. 16 UMBC and there were losses by No. 1 seed Virginia and No. 4 seed Arizona in the first round among others. However it's unclear from the given information who exactly they played against beyond UMBC.  Wait let me reread that part again: ""The first round losses by No. 1 seed Virginia and No. 4 seed Arizona  and second round losses by No. 2 seed Cincinnati and No. 3 seed Tennessee  led to the South Region becoming the first ever to not advance any of its top four seeds to the Sweet Sixteen .

So focusing on that it says No. 1 seed Virginia lost in the first round to UMBC because they became the first South Region top four seeds (including the No. 1) to not advance to the Sweet Sixteen.

It is revealed that Crowley brought back Samuel so that they could help him find Purgatory , the afterlife of monsters , and that Samuel has been working for him . Crowley then states that if Sam and Dean help him he will return Sam 's soul , but if they do not help him he will send Sam back to Hell . Although Sam still retains his memories , likes , dislikes , and is capable of making rational decisions , he is completely without emotion and appears almost inhuman .
Question: why did sam want dean to become a vampire
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out why Sam wants Dean to become a vampire based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again to make sure I understand all the details.  Sam has been searching for something that brought him back from Hell and is currently hunting with his mother's side of the family the Campbells led by their grandfather Samuel who was also resurrected. Dean notices some changes in Sam's behavior—using a baby as bait allowing a child to undergo torturous treatment for info and even becoming a vampire.  Now I need to connect these dots to understand why Sam would want Dean to become a vampire.  First I know that Sam has been through a lot including time in Hell. He seems to have some sort of connection with Lucifer's Cage because his soul isn't with him anymore. Crowley brought back Samuel (Samuel) to help find Purgatory for monsters and if Sam and Dean don't help Crowley he'll send Sam back.  But how does this relate to Dean becoming a vampire? Well maybe it has to do with the power Crowley wants or something that Sam needs from him. The context mentions that Sam is using Dean in some way—perhaps as a tool or for some kind of ritual.  I remember from previous knowledge (even though I don't have all the details here) that vampires can manipulate people through fear which might be why Crowley would want to turn Dean into one so he can control him. Maybe Crowley sees a future where Sam relies on Dean's vampire nature to get what they need—like accessing something in Hell or gaining power.  Also the context says that during their time together Dean notices these changes in Sam—he starts using him as bait allowing children through tough situations for information and even becoming a vampire. So perhaps Sam is trying to instill some of these traits into Dean because he wants control over him or to manipulate him in some way.  Another angle could be that Crowley needs Sam's help to free himself or to reach Purgatory. Maybe Sam sees that without Dean as a vampire they can't achieve their goals so he coerces or manipulates Dean into becoming one to gain the necessary power or knowledge.  I also recall that in other contexts vampires have been used for control especially by beings like Crowley who want influence over others. So it's possible that Sam is using this dynamic because he knows it's effective against Crowley—maybe because of past experiences with him.  So putting it all together: Sam wants Dean to become a vampire likely because Crowley needs his help to achieve something (like freeing himself or accessing Purgatory) and turning Dean into a vampire gives Crowley the control he needs over him. Additionally Sam might be using this to manipulate Dean into doing what they need for their purposes.  Sam sought to turn Dean into a vampire primarily to gain control over him as Crowley requires Sam's assistance to achieve his objectives such as freeing himself or accessing Purgatory. The transformation allows Crowley to exert influence over Dean effectively leveraging the vampire's power and manipulative abilities.,sam sought to turn dean into vampire primarily to gain control over him as crowley requires sams assistance to achieve his objectives such as freeing himself or accessing purgatory transformation allows crowley to exert influence over dean effectively leveraging vampires power and manipulative abilities,Sam's soul is not with him,0,0.08,5.113403499999549,0.0017864450293777294,0.0005245370438241684,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who wrote the song always be humble and kind
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out who wrote the song ""Always Be humble and Kind."" The context provided mentions that Lori McKenna wrote it. She released her version for her eighth studio album The Bird and the Rifle in July 2016. However the song was originally written by Tim McGraw as his second single from his 14th album Damn Country Music on January 20 2016.  So since the question is about who wrote the song always be humble and kind I should look at both mentions. But wait the name might vary; maybe it's a different version or the same song with different versions? The context says ""Humble and Kind"" was Tim McGraw's song initially and Lori recorded her own version.  But if we're focusing on who wrote the original song that's referenced in the question (always be humble and kind) without specifying which version it might be referring to Tim McGraw. However Lori is also involved as she covered it. But since the context says ""Humble and Kind"" was written by Lori but McGraw released his first single from it on January 20th.  Wait I think there's some confusion here. The song title in the question might be different or same as the one described in the context. Let me read again: Context talks about ""Humble and Kind "" which is Tim McGraw's original song with Lori contributing her version. But the question is asking who wrote ""Always Be humble and Kind."" Hmm maybe it's a slightly different title?  Wait no looking at the user query again: They're asking specifically for ""Always Be humble and kind."" The context says that ""Humble and Kind"" was written by Lori but perhaps ""Always Be"" refers to Tim McGraw? Or is there a mix-up in titles.  Wait actually maybe I misread. Let me check the original question again: ""who wrote the song always be humble and kind."" So it's asking about that exact title. The context mentions that Lori wrote ""Humble and Kind "" which was released as Tim McGraw's single on Jan 20th.  Wait perhaps there is a version where both performed it. But according to the context Lori recorded her version for her album later in July 2016 but Tim McGraw's song was his first single from that album. So if ""Always Be humble and kind"" refers to Tim McGraw's version then he wrote it.  Alternatively perhaps there's a mistake because ""Humble and Kind"" is what Lori wrote while Tim has another track called ""Always Be "" but I'm not sure.  Wait no in the context provided only ""Humble and Kind"" is mentioned as written by Lori. So maybe the correct answer is that Lori McKenna wrote it. But wait her version was released later than Tim's single. Maybe the song title could be slightly different.  But given the exact question: always be humble and kind which likely refers to Tim McGraw's version because Lori's is under a different name. Or maybe not; perhaps ""Always Be"" is part of the song title for her version? Wait in the context it says Lori recorded her rendition later that same year.  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me structure this:  Context:  - ""Humble and Kind"" by Tim McGraw (single) - written by Lori McKenna? No wait: The first sentence says ""Humble and Kind"" is a song written by Lori McKenna and released by Tim McGraw as his single on Jan 20 2016.  Wait no actually the wording is: ""written by Lori McKenna and first released by American singer Tim McGraw..."" So Tim released it under his name. Therefore Tim wrote it; Lori contributed her version.  But wait context says that Lori later recorded hers for her album in July 2016.  So to answer who wrote the song always be humble and kind: The original version was written by Tim McGraw but Lori McKenna also has a version of it. So which one is referred to?  The question uses ""Always Be humble and Kind "" which isn't mentioned in the context as written by Lori. Therefore perhaps the correct answer is Tim McGraw wrote that song.  Alternatively if ""Always Be"" refers to Tim's version then he wrote it; if it refers to Lori's version she did.  But since the question says ""always be humble and kind "" without a specific version maybe the context doesn't cover it. However given that in the context Lori wrote ""Humble and Kind "" but perhaps the song they're referring to is Tim McGraw's original single which was called something else or referred to as ""Always Be.""  Wait no: The user might have meant the song titled ""Always Be humble and kind."" If so then maybe that's not one of the mentioned in the context. So based on the given information the only song by Lori is ""Humble and Kind "" but Tim wrote his version.  I think perhaps there was a mistake in the song titles. Maybe ""Humble and Kind"" is the song with Tim McGraw written by Lori. Then the user's question refers to that same song or another one.  Alternatively maybe the context has an error because the first sentence says that Lori wrote it but Tim released it as his single while she later recorded hers for her album. So ""Humble and Kind"" was Tim's original song written by him with Lori contributing? Or is it the other way around?  Wait no: The exact words are: ""Humble and Kind"" is a song written by Lori McKenna and first released by Tim McGraw as his single on Jan 20th. So Tim wrote that song; Lori co-wrote or contributed to it.  But then Lori later recorded her version for her album. Therefore the answer would be Tim McGraw wrote ""Humble and Kind"" (single) while Lori McKenna also performed it.  So if the question is asking who wrote ""Always Be humble and kind "" which might refer to Tim's original song then Tim is the writer.  Alternatively perhaps ""Always Be"" is part of the song title in her version? If so then she wrote that too. But without more context I have to go with the information given.  The song ""Always Be Humble and Kind"" was written by Lori McKenna as she later recorded it for her album *The Bird and the Rifle*. However the original single ""Humble and Kind"" was written by Tim McGraw. Since the question refers to ""Always Be humble and kind "" it likely pertains to Lori's version so she is the author.

Context: Each season 's individual Blu - ray and DVD set contains several short animated sequences narrated by the show 's cast as their characters as they detail various different events in the history of Westeros . For the seventh season release , it will include the animated prequel series Game of Thrones : Conquest & Rebellion , which is illustrated in a different animation style than previous videos . The series focuses on Aegon Targaryen 's conquest of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros .
Question: what is the time setting of game of thrones
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the time setting for Game of Thrones based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that each season's Blu-ray and DVD set includes animated sequences narrated by the show's cast detailing events in Westeros' history. For the seventh season there's a prequel called ""Game of Thrones: Conquest & Rebellion"" which focuses on Aegon Targaryen's conquest of the Seven Kingdoms.  Hmm wait a minute. The context talks about Game of Thrones being a prequel that illustrates Aegon Targaryen's actions. So if it's a prequel that means it happened before the events of the main series. The main series typically starts in the time after the fall of King's Landing and before the Stark siblings arrive.  I remember that the main series begins with Bran being king in the North around the year 200 years before the events of the show as we know it. So if this prequel is about Aegon Targaryen's conquests which are before the main timeline it must be even earlier.  The context doesn't specify a year for ""Conquest & Rebellion "" but since it's a prequel I can infer that it takes place further back in time. Typically such shows set their events before the major events of the main series to establish the political backdrop.  So putting this together the time setting is likely several centuries before the main story of Game of Thrones. Specifically around 200 years prior.  The time setting of ""Game of Thrones: Conquest & Rebellion"" is approximately 200 years before the events of the main series establishing a political backdrop in Westeros.", time setting of game of thrones conquest rebellion is approximately 200 years before events of main series establishing political backdrop in westeros,medieval,0,0.0,2.9826792999956524,0.0010394588871595117,0.00030520653190058204,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who has the world's largest standing army
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out which country has the largest standing army in the world. Hmm from what I know this information isn't always publicly available because military budgets can vary and sometimes aren't disclosed. But maybe some countries have more transparency about their armed forces' size.  I remember hearing that countries with big economies or those involved in significant international operations might have larger armies. Countries like the United States probably do since they're a major superpower and spend heavily on defense. Maybe Russia has a large army too because of its involvement in conflicts and having a long history of military buildup.  China comes to mind as well; I think their military is one of the largest especially considering their role in regional conflicts and having large navies and air forces. Their population is huge so maybe they have more soldiers than other countries combined.  South Africa was involved in apartheid and has a significant military presence for counter-terrorism and security operations in South Africa and surrounding areas. Maybe their army isn't the largest but it's notable.  I'm not sure about India; I think they've been building up their military too especially with recent conflicts like in Kashmir. Their population is large so that might contribute to a big army.  NATO countries have large armies too because they're grouped together for defense. Countries like France and the UK are part of NATO and probably maintain sizable forces for mutual defense.  Wait the United States has a huge military both overseas and at home. They have the largest standing army in the world because they have the most permanent soldiers including marines air force etc. But I'm not entirely sure if it's more than Russia or China.  Russia has an extensive landlocked empire with many subdivisions so their army might be massive but maybe not as large as the US. Similarly India and China are in a competitive situation there.  China also has a vast navy and air force contributing to their overall defense capabilities. Their military expenditure is high which suggests a large standing army.  So putting it all together I think either the United States Russia or China have the largest armies. Since the user provided some data about countries with defense-related statistics maybe looking at that can help.  Looking back at the data I see several entries like Germany France the UK Japan South Korea etc. which are all part of NATO and likely have large permanent armies. Russia is listed as having 831 000 in military expenditure but it's unclear if their army size directly correlates.  However without exact figures on active duty personnel it's tricky to compare. But considering the US has a GDP around $2 trillion and spends about 3% on defense which employs over 1 million soldiers they might lead. China's military is estimated to be around 1.6 million people but I'm not sure if that includes permanent or contract troops.  In conclusion while the US likely has one of the largest standing armies possibly larger than Russia and China due to its high defense budget and population size it's a bit unclear without exact numbers.  The United States is widely regarded as having one of the world's largest standing armies. This conclusion is based on its significant defense expenditure which employs over 1 million soldiers. While Russia has an extensive military infrastructure and China also possesses a large army due to their substantial defense budgets and population sizes the U.S. stands out with its highest defense expenditure relative to its GDP and permanent military personnel., united states is widely regarded as having one of worlds largest standing armies this conclusion is based on its significant defense expenditure which employs over 1 million soldiers while russia has extensive military infrastructure and china also possesses large army due to their substantial defense budgets and population sizes us stands out with its highest defense expenditure relative to its gdp and permanent military personnel,China,0,0.030303030303030307,6.778146600001492,0.0023969123448902745,0.0007037828172817294,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who played bat masterson in the movie tombstone
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who played Bat Masterson in the movie Tombstone. Let me start by recalling what I know about this movie. Tombstone is a classic Western film directed by Sam Peckinpah right? It stars a few well-known actors including Lee Van Dyk as Billy Bob ""Tubby"" Thayer and Jim Neath as Sam ""Sammy"" Creager. But the question is about Bat Masterson.  Wait I remember that there was an actor who played a significant role in Tombstone but his name isn't as prominent as Lee or Jim. Maybe it's someone like Tony Amendola? I think I've heard his name before in the context of Westerns. Let me try to piece together more details.  In the movie Bat Masterson is a character who has some interactions with the main characters. The setting involves a saloon so maybe the actor had roles that fit into that environment. Also considering the cast list I might have seen before it's possible that Tony was in the film alongside Lee and Jim.  I'm trying to think if there are any other actors from that era who played minor but important roles. Maybe someone like Richard Attenborough? No he didn't play a character named Bat Masterson in Tombstone as far as I recall. It might be someone else entirely.  Another thought: sometimes the roles are portrayed by older actors in their prime. So maybe it's Tony Amendola who was quite active in the 60s and 70s. His face resembles the character of Bat Masterson enough to make sense. Plus considering that the movie is from 1983 he might have been in his prime then.  I should probably double-check this. If I remember correctly the cast included Lee Van Dyk Jim Neath and Tony Amendola as Bat Masterson. So putting it all together it's safe to say that Tony Amendola played Bat Masterson in Tombstone.

Context: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act , which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773 . Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to `` No taxation without representation '' , that is , to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented . In addition , the well - connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers , who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business . Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies , but in Boston , embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain .

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out why the colonists were troubled by the Tea Act of 1773. Let me start by reading through the context provided. It says that the Tea Act was passed by British Parliament and the colonists were resistant. They objected because they believed it violated their rights as Englishmen under ""no taxation without representation."" That means they thought only elected representatives could tax them but Britain taxed them through a parliament they weren't represented in.  Additionally there's mention of the East India Company having competitive advantages which made colonial tea importers feel resentful. They were probably unhappy about that too. The colonists had successfully prevented unloading in other colonies like Connecticut and Virginia so Boston was left with a problem. Here the Royal Governor Hutchinson refused to allow the taxed tea to be returned.  Putting this together the main issues for the colonists were taxes without representation the unfair advantage of the East India Company and failure to resolve the tea issue elsewhere. So their complaints centered around these three points: taxation without being able to represent themselves the unfair business practices by the East India Company and the local government's refusal in Boston.  The colonists were troubled by the Tea Act because it violated their ""no taxation without representation"" principle as Britain taxed them through an unelected parliament. The act gave advantageous trade terms to the East India Company alienating colonial merchants. Additionally local leaders in Boston refused to return the tea despite previous successes elsewhere.", colonists were troubled by tea act because it violated their no taxation without representation principle as britain taxed them through unelected parliament act gave advantageous trade terms to east india company alienating colonial merchants additionally local leaders in boston refused to return tea despite previous successes elsewhere,"because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to ""No taxation without representation"", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented",0,0.35714285714285715,2.5645298000017647,0.0008871628502762876,0.00026048927967105826,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: In Judaism , a hard - boiled egg is an element of the Passover Seder , representing festival sacrifice . The children 's game of hunting for the afikomen ( a half - piece of matzo ) has similarities to the Easter egg hunt tradition , by which the child who finds the hidden bread will be awarded a prize .

Question: who started the tradition of coloring easter eggs
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who started the tradition of coloring Easter eggs. The context provided mentions something about Passover and afikomens in Judaism as well as an Easter egg hunt tradition. Let me break this down.  First the context talks about a hard-boiled egg being part of Passover Seder for festival sacrifice. Then it mentions a game where children hide an afikomen (half-matzo) and others search for it; when parents can't find it kids reveal its location to get a prize. This sounds similar to the Easter egg hunt which is also mentioned.  Wait so in some places the Easter egg hunt involves hiding eggs with dyed dye. I think that's from the Christian tradition where eggs are colored as part of the Easter celebration. So maybe the coloring of Easter eggs comes from Christianity specifically from traditions around decorating eggs during Passover and then Easter.  But how does this relate to the context given? The context doesn't mention the origin but relates Passover activities to Easter events. However historically the tradition of decorating eggs with dyed colors is often attributed to Christian communities particularly during the Middle Ages when Christianity became more prominent in Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire.  So putting it together the coloring of Easter eggs started as part of the Christian Easter celebrations possibly when they began incorporating elements from Passover traditions into their own festivals. Therefore it's likely that European Christians began coloring the eggs as part of both Passover and later Easter traditions.  The tradition of coloring Easter eggs originated in Christian communities during the Middle Ages as part of their celebration of Easter drawing inspiration from Passover traditions where similar egg-coloring practices were used., tradition of coloring easter eggs originated in christian communities during middle ages as part of their celebration of easter drawing inspiration from passover traditions where similar eggcoloring practices were used,early Christians of Mesopotamia,0,0.058823529411764705,2.8722184999933233,0.0009977417611812486,0.0002929575247508346,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: which is the world's largest company in terms of revenue
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which company is the world's largest based on the revenue provided in the context. Let me look through the data step by step.  First I'll scan the list for the highest revenue numbers. Scanning down I see that Apple is listed at $215 million with a revenue growth of 7.7%. That seems pretty high compared to other companies like Walmart and State Grid which are in the billions but much lower than Apple's figure.  Wait no looking again actually State Grid has a revenue of about 3 billion USD (since it's written as 2999560000000099999) which is more than Walmart. But I'm supposed to find the largest in terms of revenue.  Looking further down the list I see Ford Motor Company at number 22 with $151 800 million. That's a significant number but perhaps not the highest. Then Amazon is listed as number 27 with $135 billion which is substantial. Wait no looking more closely the revenue for Amazon is written as 135 987 million which converts to approximately $135.987 billion.  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me check each company's revenue:  - Apple: $215 639 million = ~$215.64 billion - Ford Motor Company: $151 800 million = ~$151.8 billion - General Motors: $166 380 million (~$166.38 billion) - Toyota: $254 694 million (~$254.7 billion) Wait no the numbers are in millions so I need to convert them correctly.  Looking at each company's revenue:  Apple: 215 639 million = ~$215.64 billion Ford: 151 800 million = ~$151.8 billion General Motors: 166 380 million (~$166.38 billion) Toyota: 254 694 million (~$254.7 billion)  Wait so Toyota is higher than Ford and GM? That seems off because I know Ford is a major automotive company.  But according to the numbers here Toyota has $254 billion in revenue which would make them the largest. But I thought Apple was the largest with over $200 billion. Maybe there's an error in how the numbers are presented.  Wait looking back at the context:  For Apple: $215 639 with a note that it's 7.7% growth. The revenue is written as 2999230000000099999 USD millions which converts to approximately $215.9 billion.  Ford is at 151 800 million which is ~$151.8 billion.  But then I see General Motors at 166 380 million (~$166.4 billion) and Toyota at 254 694 million (~$254.7 billion). So according to the data provided Toyota would have a higher revenue than Apple.  Wait but in reality Ford Motor Company is one of the largest automakers globally with around $300 billion revenue. But perhaps in this context the numbers are incorrect or misrepresented.  Alternatively maybe I'm misinterpreting the notation. The numbers for Apple and Ford are written as 215 639 million (which would be ~$215.64 billion) and Ford at 151 800 million (~$151.8 billion). However General Motors is listed at $166 380 million which is about $166.4 billion. Toyota is next with $254 694 million so ~$254.7 billion.  Wait that can't be right because in reality companies like Apple and Ford are way larger than GM and Toyota. So perhaps the data provided is incorrect or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.  Alternatively maybe the numbers are presented differently—perhaps they're already in billions but written as million millions (i.e. 1 followed by 6 zeros instead of 9). Let me check:  Looking at Apple's revenue: $215 639 million. If it's in million dollars that would be 215 639 000 000 USD ($215.64 billion).  Ford: 151 800 million = 151 800 000 000 ($151.8 billion)  GM: 166 380 million = ~$166.4 billion  Toyota: 254 694 million = ~$254.7 billion  Wait so according to this data Toyota is the largest with $254.7 billion. But that doesn't align with my prior knowledge because Ford Motor Company has over $300 billion in revenue.  This suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in how the numbers are presented or I'm misinterpreting them. Alternatively maybe the context provided isn't up-to-date or accurate.  Wait looking back at the context for Apple it says ""2999230000000099999 ♠"" which might be a formatting issue. Let me check each company's revenue properly:  1. Apple: 299 923 000 000 000 000 (but that can't be right because it would be in trillions). Wait perhaps the commas are misplaced.  Wait let's parse each line correctly:  - Line 1: Walmart - $485 873 followed by some numbers and a revenue growth. It seems like the actual revenue is written as $485 873 million (which would be ~$485.873 billion).  But for Apple it's ""2999230000000099999 ♠"" which might translate to 299 923 followed by some zeros. Wait perhaps each number is in millions but written with commas as thousand separators.  Wait the format seems inconsistent. For example:  Ford: $151 800 million which would be ~$151.8 billion.  But Toyota's revenue is listed as 254 694 million (~$254.7 billion) making them larger than Ford and GM but smaller than Apple if Apple is correctly at ~$215.64 billion.  Wait this doesn't make sense because in reality Ford is a top automotive company with higher revenue than Toyota or GM.  I think I must be misinterpreting the data presentation. Let me re-examine each entry:  Looking for the highest revenue:  - Apple: $299 923 000 000 000 (but that's written as 2999230000000099999). Wait perhaps it's in trillions. Let me break it down:  For Apple: 299 923 followed by million millions? That would be $299 923 billion which is ~$299.923 trillion.  Wait that can't be right because the total revenue for companies like Ford are in the hundreds of billions.  So perhaps each number is already in millions and we need to convert them correctly.  Let me try again:  - Apple: 215 639 million = $215.639 billion - Ford: 151 800 million = ~$151.8 billion - GM: 166 380 million (~$166.4 billion) - Toyota: 254 694 million (~$254.7 billion)  So according to this data Toyota is the largest with $254.7 billion.  But in reality Ford Motor Company has a revenue of over $300 billion so perhaps there's a mistake in how the numbers are presented here.  Wait looking again at the context:  For Apple: ""2999230000000099999 ♠"" – maybe this is representing 299 923 followed by some zeros. Perhaps it's meant to be 299 923 million which would be ~$299.923 billion.  But even then that's higher than Ford and GM but lower than Toyota if Toyota is at $254.7 billion? That doesn't make sense either because in reality Ford has more revenue than Toyota.  I think I must have misread the numbers or there's a formatting issue with how the revenues are presented. Alternatively maybe the data provided is incorrect or out of date.  Alternatively perhaps the ""2999230000000099999"" for Apple represents 299 923 followed by more digits but I'm not interpreting it correctly.  Wait let me count the digits:  - For Ford: 151 800 million = 151 800 x 1 000 000 = 151.8 billion  - For Toyota: 254 694 million = ~$254.7 billion  But Apple's number is written as ""2999230000000099999"". Let me count the digits after 299:  It seems like it's a long number with commas for thousands but perhaps each comma represents three more zeros.  Alternatively maybe each revenue is in hundreds of billions. For example Ford: 151 800 million = ~$151.8 billion.  But then Apple at 299 923 million would be ~$299.923 billion making it the highest followed by Toyota at ~$254.7 billion Ford at ~$151.8 billion and GM at ~$166.4 billion.  Wait that can't be right because in reality companies like Ford have much higher revenues than that.  I'm getting confused here. Let me list out the actual numbers correctly:  Looking for each company's revenue (in billions):  - Apple: $299 923 million = ~$299.9 billion - Ford: $151 800 million = ~$151.8 billion - GM: $166 380 million (~$166.4 billion) - Toyota: $254 694 million (~$254.7 billion)  Wait so according to this data Toyota is the largest with ~$254.7 billion.  But I thought Ford Motor Company had higher revenue than that in reality. So perhaps there's a mistake here or the context provided has incorrect numbers.  Alternatively maybe the context was cut off and some companies have higher numbers not listed here.  Wait looking at the last entries:  - Amazon: $135 987 million (~$135.99 billion) - Ford Motor Company: ~$151.8 billion - Toyota: ~$254.7 billion  So according to this list Toyota is the largest.  But I know from real data that Ford has around $300+ billion in revenue so perhaps this context is outdated or incorrect.  Alternatively maybe the numbers are presented differently—perhaps they're already in trillions?  Wait for example:  - Apple: 299 923 million = ~$299.923 trillion  That would make sense if the company's revenue is that high but I don't think it's correct because even Ford's $151.8 billion doesn't reach $0.15 trillion.  Alternatively perhaps each number represents something else.  I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for the highest number in this context:  The largest figure given is for Toyota at 254 694 million (~$254.7 billion) followed by Ford at ~$151.8 billion then GM at ~$166.4 billion.  Wait that can't be right because GM should have a higher revenue than Ford but here Ford is higher than GM according to this data.  So perhaps there's an error in the order or the numbers are misinterpreted.  Alternatively maybe each revenue figure is missing a decimal point or has misplaced commas.  Let me try converting all revenues to billions:  - Apple: 299 923 million = $299.923 billion - Ford: 151 800 million = ~$151.8 billion - GM: 166 380 million (~$166.4 billion) - Toyota: 254 694 million (~$254.7 billion)  So according to this Toyota is the largest with $254.7 billion.  But in reality Ford has higher revenue so perhaps the context provided is incorrect or out of date.  Alternatively maybe the context lists only a subset of companies and the largest isn't included here.  Wait looking at the list after Toyota the next highest would be Apple with $254.7 billion then Ford at ~$151.8 billion GM at ~$166.4 billion.  So the order from highest to lowest would be:  1. Toyota: $254.7 billion 2. Apple: $299.9 billion (Wait no—Apple's number is higher than Toyota if it's 299.9) But according to this data Apple has ~$299.9 billion.  So the order would be:  1. Apple: $299.9 billion 2. Toyota: $254.7 billion 3. GM: ~$166.4 billion 4. Ford: ~$151.8 billion  But I thought Ford is larger than GM but according to this data GM has higher revenue.  So perhaps the context provided lists incorrect numbers for these companies.  Alternatively maybe I'm misinterpreting how the revenues are written.  Wait looking back at the original context:  For Apple: ""2999230000000099999 ♠"" – perhaps this is a placeholder or an error in formatting. Maybe it's supposed to be $215 billion as per another line?  No that doesn't make sense.  Alternatively maybe the commas are representing different groupings. For example 299 923 followed by more digits could represent a larger number.  Wait perhaps each revenue is written with multiple segments separated by ♠ or other symbols making it unclear.  Given all this confusion I think the safest assumption based on the data provided in the context is that Apple has the highest revenue at ~$215.64 billion followed by Toyota at ~$254.7 billion which contradicts my prior knowledge but could be due to incorrect data.  Alternatively perhaps Ford Motor Company's figure is correct as ~$300 billion in real life so there might be a mistake in the context.  But based solely on the numbers provided in the context the largest revenue is $254.7 billion for Toyota.  The company listed with the highest revenue in this context is Toyota with approximately $254.7 billion.  Step-by-step explanation: 1. Review each company's revenue figures from the provided context. 2. Convert each figure to a more understandable scale (e.g. billions). 3. Compare the revenues: Apple at ~$299.9 billion Ford at ~$151.8 billion GM at ~$166.4 billion and Toyota at ~$254.7 billion. 4. Determine that Toyota has the highest revenue based on the given data.

269,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: Exocrine glands are glands that produce and secrete substances onto an epithelial surface by way of a duct . Examples of exocrine glands include sweat , salivary , mammary , ceruminous , lacrimal , sebaceous , and mucous . Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body , the other being endocrine glands , which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream . The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands ; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products -- bile and pancreatic juice -- into the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts , and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream .
Question: where do the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products
Answer: ",Alright so I'm trying to figure out where the secretory cells of endocrine glands secrete their products. From what I remember there are two main types of glands in the body: exocrine and endocrine. Exocrine glands produce and secrete substances directly onto an epithelial surface through ducts like sweat or salivary glands. On the other hand endocrine glands release their secretions into the bloodstream instead of a duct.  The context provided mentions that the liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine. It explains that they secrete products like bile and pancreatic juice through ducts for the digestive system but also secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream as endocrine functions.   So putting this together if an endocrine gland's secretory cells need to release their products they don't use a duct because that's more of an exocrine function. Instead they directly send these hormones or secretions into the blood through the bloodstream. This is how hormones travel from the glands to other parts of the body.  I think the answer should be straightforward: endocrine glands secrete their products into the bloodstream. I don't see any conflicting information in the context that would suggest a different pathway.  Endocrine glands secrete their products directly into the bloodstream.,endocrine glands secrete their products directly into bloodstream,directly into the bloodstream,0,0.5454545454545454,2.344387800010736,0.0008091990325112535,0.00023759749748733104,0.0,0.0,0.0
270,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: The Beer Hall Putsch , also known as the Munich Putsch , and , in German , as the Hitlerputsch , Hitler - Ludendorff - Putsch , Bürgerbräu - Putsch or mostly Marsch auf die Feldherrnhalle , was a failed coup attempt by the Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) leader Adolf Hitler -- along with Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff and other Kampfbund leaders -- to seize power in Munich , Bavaria , during 8 -- 9 November 1923 . About two thousand Nazis marched to the centre of Munich , where they confronted the police , which resulted in the death of 16 Nazis and four police officers . Hitler was not wounded during the clash , although he locked his left arm with the right arm of Max Erwin von Scheubner - Richter who , when he was shot and killed , pulled Hitler to the pavement with him . Hitler escaped immediate arrest and was spirited off to safety in the countryside . After two days , Hitler was arrested and charged with treason .
Question: where did the beer hall putsch take place
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the Beer Hall Putsch took place. Let me start by reading through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that it's also known as the Munich Putsch or the Hitlerputsch. It happened on November 8-9 1923 in Munich Bavaria. There were about two thousand Nazis who went to the center of Munich and faced the police. This resulted in 16 Nazis and four police officers being killed. The leader Adolf Hitler wasn't seriously hurt but was pulled down with another person after being shot. He later escaped and was caught two days later.  So from this it's clear that the event took place in Munich Bavaria. I don't think there are any other places mentioned related to this specific incident. The key words here are ""Munich"" and ""Bavaria "" which are both locations. Since the event occurred during a night march to the center of Munich the location must be Munich itself.  I should make sure that ""Bavaria"" is specified because it's part of Germany but in this context it refers to the state where Munich is located.

271,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: In modern times , the Ides of March is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC . Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate . As many as 60 conspirators , led by Brutus and Cassius , were involved . According to Plutarch , a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March . On his way to the Theatre of Pompey , where he would be assassinated , Caesar passed the seer and joked , `` The Ides of March are come '' , implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled , to which the seer replied `` Aye , Caesar ; but not gone . '' This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare 's play Julius Caesar , when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to `` beware the Ides of March . '' The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the `` seer '' as a haruspex named Spurinna .
Question: who said beware of the ides of march
Answer: ","Okay I need to answer the question ""Who said 'beware of the ides of March'?"" based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that there was a seer who warned Caesar about something happening on the Ides of March. It says that according to Plutarch a seer had foretold that harm would come to Caesar no later than that date. Then when Caesar passed the seer and made a joke implying the prophecy wasn't fulfilled the seer replied ""Aye Caesar; but not gone.""   The context also notes that this incident is famously portrayed in William Shakespeare's play ""Julius Caesar."" Additionally it identifies the seer as a Roman biographer named Suetonius. Wait no actually it says Suetonius identifies the seer as a haruspex named Spurinna.  Wait so the seer is Spurinna? Or is the seer someone else? Let me check again. The context states: ""The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the 'seer' as a haruspex named Spurinna."" So according to Suetonius the seer was Spurinna.  But in the question it's asking who said ""beware of the ides of march "" not necessarily identifying the seer. The context says that Plutarch mentioned the seer warned Caesar about this date and when he passed by the seer Caesar made a joke implying it wasn't going to happen yet but the seer reassured him.  However in Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar the seer is referred to as a soothsayer who told Caesar to beware of the ides of march. So the answer would be that Plutarch mentioned the seer and Suetonius names Spurinna as the haruspex (the seer) while Shakespeare's play portrays this soothsayer.  Wait but the question is asking who said ""beware of the ides of march."" In the context it says that according to Plutarch a seer had warned that harm would come no later than the Ides of March. Then when Caesar passed the seer and made the joke the seer replied he knew but it hadn't happened yet.  But in the play the soothsayer told Caesar to beware of the ides of march. So who is ""who""? The context doesn't explicitly state that Plutarch or Suetonius said that directly; rather it's Plutarch mentioning the seer did so. However the answer might be Plutarch since he mentions the seer's warning.  Wait but I'm a bit confused because in the play it's portrayed as a soothsayer. So perhaps the answer is that Plutarch said that a seer foretold it and Suetonius identified the seer as Spurinna while Shakespeare's play portrays this soothsayer.  But looking back at the context: ""As many as 60 conspirators  led by Brutus and Cassius  were involved . According to Plutarch  a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March ."" So Plutarch is directly stating that a seer (the soothsayer) warned him about it. Therefore Plutarch is the one who said ""beware of the ides of march"" through his account.  Wait but in the play it's the soothsayer who tells Caesar to beware. So perhaps both Plutarch and Suetonius are involved here. But the question asks for who so maybe the answer is that Plutarch mentioned the seer did so and Suetonius identified him as Spurinna.  But looking at the context again: ""According to Plutarch  a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March ."" So it's Plutarch who said this. Then when Caesar passed the seer and made his joke the seer replied he knew but it hadn't happened yet.  However in the play it's portrayed as a soothsayer. So perhaps both Plutarch and Shakespeare are involved. But since the question is about ""who said 'beware of the ides of march '"" I think the answer is Plutarch because he directly mentions that a seer warned him about it on March 15 which was his death date.  Wait but in reality Caesar was assassinated on March 15th and the Ides of March refers to March 15. So the seer warned him before that date. But according to Plutarch's account he did warn him. Then in Shakespeare's play it's portrayed as the soothsayer telling Caesar not to worry yet.  So perhaps the answer is both Plutarch (through his source) and Suetonius (identifying Spurinna). However since the question asks for who said ""beware of the ides of march "" maybe it's referring to Plutarch because he directly mentions that a seer warned Caesar about it.  Wait but in the context provided it says: ""According to Plutarch  a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March ."" So Plutarch is the one who said that.

Question: who won the ladies ice skating in the olympics
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who won ladies' ice skating at the Olympics based on the provided context. Let me go through the data step by step.  First I'll look for any mentions of ""ladies"" or ""women's"" in the games they competed in as that would indicate women's events. Then within those entries I should check who won each event and specifically focus on ice skating.  Starting from 1908 London: There are two entries Madge Syers and Elsa Rendschmidt both from Great Britain. But looking at the details it just lists their names without specifying wins or medals in ice skating so I can't confirm if they won any medals here for women's ice skating.  Next is 1920 Antwerp: The entries are Magda Julin from Sweden and Svea Norén also from Sweden. Again no details on wins specifically in women's ice skating.  In 1924 Chamonix there's Herma Szabo from Austria Beatrix Loughran from the United States and Ethel Muckelt from Great Britain. None of these seem to be specific to women's ice skating either.  Moving to 1928 St. Moritz: Sonja Henie from Norway and Fritzi Burger from Austria along with Beatrix Loughran from the U.S. Again no explicit info on women's ice skating wins.  Looking at 1932 Lake Placid: Sonja Henie (Norway) Fritzi Burger (Austria) Maribel Vinson (U.S.). Still nothing specific about women's ice skating medals.  For 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen entries include Sonja Henie from Norway and Cecilia Colledge and Vivi Anne Hultén from Sweden. This doesn't specify women's ice skating either.  In 1948 St. Moritz: Barbara Ann Scott from Canada Eva Pawlik from Austria Jeannette Altwegg from Great Britain. Jeannette Altwegg is known to have won medals in various events but not specifically in women's ice skating in this context.  1952 Oslo: Jeannette Altwegg (Great Britain) Tenley Albright (U.S.) and Jacqueline du Bief (France). Again no mention of ice skating or wins.  1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo: Tenley Albright (U.S.) Carol Heiss (U.S.) Ingrid Wendl from Austria. No women's ice skating info here.  1960 Squaw Valley: Carol Heiss (U.S.) Sjoukje Dijkstra (Netherlands) Barbara Roles (U.S.). Still no specifics on women's ice skating.  1964 Innsbruck: Sjoukje Dijkstra from Netherlands Regine Heitzer and Petra Burka. No info on women's ice skating wins.  1968 Grenoble: Peggy Fleming (U.S.) Gabriele Seyfert from East Germany Hana Mašková from Czechoslovakia. No mentions of ice skating.  1972 Sapporo: Beatrix Schuba (Austria) Karen Magnussen (Canada) Janet Lynn (U.S.). Not related to women's ice skating.  1976 Innsbruck: Dorothy Hamill (U.S.) Dianne de Leeuw (Netherlands) Christine Errath from East Germany. No specifics here.  1980 Lake Placid: Anett Pötzsch (East Germany) Linda Fratianne (U.S.) Dagmar Lurz (West Germany). Doesn't specify women's ice skating.  1984 Sarajevo: Katarina Witt from East Germany Rosalynn Sumners (U.S.) Kira Ivanova from Soviet Union. Katarina Witt is known to have won in women's singles but I need to check the context here.  Looking through these entries for any mentions of Katarina Witt winning in women's ice skating at Sarajevo 1984. Yes her details include ""Katarina Witt East Germany"" and she was a competitor in singles so likely won that event.  In 1988 Calgary: Katarina Witt (East Germany) Elizabeth Manley (Canada) Debi Thomas (U.S.). Again Katarina Witt is prominent here but I need to confirm if this is the same as her 1984 win.  Then in 1992 Albertville: Kristi Yamaguchi from Japan and Midori Ito from Japan. Not related to women's ice skating.  1994 Lillehammer: Oksana Baiul (Ukraine) Nancy Kerrigan (U.S.) Chen Lu (China). No women's ice skating info.  1998 Nagano: Tara Lipinski and Michelle Kwan both from U.S. along with Chen Lu from China. Still no specific mention of women's ice skating medals.  2002 Salt Lake City: Sarah Hughes (U.S.) Irina Slutskaya (Russia) Michelle Kwan (U.S.). No info on women's ice skating here.  2006 Torino: Shizuka Arakawa (Japan) Sasha Cohen (U.S.) Irina Slutskaya (Russia). No women's ice skating winners in this context.  Finally 2010 Vancouver: Yuna Kim (South Korea) Mao Asada (Japan) Joannie Rochette (Canada). This is where Yuna Kim won the gold medal for women's singles at the Vancouver 2010 Olympics. So that's a key point.  Looking through all these entries the only mention of a women's ice skating win after 1984 is in 2010 with Yuna Kim from South Korea.  Yuna Kim from South Korea won the gold medal for women's singles at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.",yuna kim from south korea won gold medal for womens singles at 2010 vancouver olympics,Alina Zagitova,0,0.0,10.036075299998629,0.003563950220779319,0.0010464491671457986,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who's opening for foo fighters at fenway
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who's opening for Foo Fighters at Fenway based on the provided context. Let me start by looking through the context again.  The context says something about ""Total 98 631 / 101 405 (97.3%) $9 107 687."" Hmm I'm not sure what that refers to right now. It might be some kind of stats or ticket sales but without more context it's hard to tell.  Wait the question is specifically about Foo Fighters' opening act at Fenway. So maybe the context includes information about who's opening for them there. But in the given context I don't see any mention of Foo Fighters or Fenway. There are numbers that might represent ticket sales or attendance percentages but no names.  I should consider if there's any hidden information. Maybe ""Total 98 631"" is tickets sold and ""101 405"" is capacity? So the percentage is 97.3% meaning they've sold about 97% of their capacity. But how does that help with the opening act?  Alternatively maybe ""$9 107 687"" refers to revenue or ticket earnings. Still without knowing who bought those tickets or if they're associated with Foo Fighters' opening show at Fenway.  I might be overcomplicating this. Since the context doesn't mention Foo Fighters or Fenway specifically it's possible that there isn't enough information here to answer the question about their opening act.

Question: what is the order of the netflix marvel shows
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the order of the Netflix Marvel shows based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that Netflix's Marvel series started in 2015 with ""Daredevil"" and ""Jessica Jones."" Then in 2016 they added ""Luke Cage."" Following that in 2017 ""Iron Fist "" a crossover miniseries called ""The Defenders "" and another one titled ""The Punisher"" were released. Also the MCU expanded to Hulu with ""Runaways"" in 2017 but another show ""Cloak & Dagger "" is coming to Freeform in 2018. There's also ""New Warriors"" scheduled for 2018 though it doesn't have a broadcaster yet.  So focusing only on Netflix's Marvel shows: ""Daredevil"" and ""Jessica Jones"" were released first in 2015 then ""Luke Cage"" in 2016. Then later that same year ""Iron Fist "" the miniseries was added. After that both ""The Defenders"" and ""The Punisher"" came out in 2017.  I should list these in chronological order starting from the earliest release. So first up are ""Daredevil"" (2015) and ""Jessica Jones"" (2015). Then ""Luke Cage"" comes next in 2016. Following that ""Iron Fist"" in 2017 followed by ""The Defenders "" then ""The Punisher.""  Wait the context mentions both ""The Defenders"" and ""The Punisher"" were released in 2017 but doesn't specify the order between them. So I should list them as they were probably added or released in that year without a specific order mentioned.  Putting it all together: The order would be ""Daredevil"" first then ""Jessica Jones "" both in 2015; then ""Luke Cage"" in 2016; followed by ""Iron Fist "" and the other two miniseries releases in 2017.  The order of Netflix Marvel shows is as follows:  1. **Daredevil** (2015) 2. **Jessica Jones** (2015) 3. **Luke Cage** (2016) 4. **Iron Fist** (2017) 5. **The Defenders** 6. **The Punisher**  Each subsequent release is listed in the order they were added or released with specific years noted where applicable.",each subsequent release is listed in order they were added or released with specific years noted where applicable,Marvel's Daredevil,0,0.0,4.638644000006025,0.0016208342670031375,0.0004759103140379773,0.0,0.0,0.0

The context says: ""Male pattern hair loss is believed to be due to a combination of genetics and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone. The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear.""  Alright so for male pattern hair loss it's a combination of genetics and something called dihydrotestosterone. I think dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a type of hormone. I remember that DHT is involved in male and female secondary sexual characteristics like reducing body hair. So this must mean that the decrease in DHT levels affects the hair growth.  The question is asking where you get male pattern baldness from. Based on the context it's because of genetics and DHT. So I should mention both factors without getting too detailed.

New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed .

Question: a type of basic rock popular in the 1980s
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out which type of rock music was popular in the 1980s based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by talking about the late 1960s with various subgenres like blues rock folk rock country rock etc. leading up to psychedelic rock influenced by the countercultural scene. Then it mentions that in the second half of the 1970s punk rock became prominent with its stripped-down and energetic social critiques.  Moving on to the 1980s it says that punk had an influence on new wave post-punk and eventually alternative rock. So that suggests alternative rock was a big thing in the late '80s. But then later it talks about alternative rock beginning to dominate in the 1990s under the names grunge Britpop and indie rock.  Wait but the question is about the 1980s specifically. So maybe the answer isn't alternative rock since that's mentioned as being dominant in the 1990s. Instead punk was influencing other genres before it became its own thing later on. The context doesn't explicitly mention a basic rock genre from the '80s but considering the transition after punk's influence maybe alternative rock is still considered part of the same category.  Alternatively perhaps in 1980s genres like new wave were more prominent which are influenced by punk. But since the question asks for ""basic"" rock which might be a subgenre that was more mainstream or foundational during that time. However looking back at the context it doesn't list any specific basic rock genre in the '80s.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The context says punk influenced new wave post-punk and alternative rock in the 1980s. But then alternative rock itself becomes a mainstay in the 1990s with grunge Britpop indie rock. So perhaps the answer is that there wasn't a specific basic rock genre popular in the '80s other than what punk influenced.  But since the question asks for a type of basic rock popular then maybe it's alternative rock because it was emerging from punk and becoming significant around that time. Alternatively if we look at the context again: ""In the second half of the 1970s punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave post-punk and eventually alternative rock."" So alternative rock is influenced by punk but started to gain traction from the late '80s onwards.  Hmm so perhaps the answer is that basic rock wasn't dominant in the '80s; instead punk influenced other genres. But since the question asks for a type of basic rock popular then maybe it's not explicitly listed. Alternatively considering that new wave and post-punk were influenced by punk but they are more about electronic elements rather than basic rock.  Wait perhaps I'm missing something else. The context mentions ""basic"" in the description as in foundational genres. But in the '80s alternative rock was gaining momentum but it's not considered a basic genre like hard rock or something. So maybe the answer is that there wasn't a specific basic rock genre popular then; instead punk influenced others.  But since I have to pick from the given context the only genre mentioned as emerging in the '80s that was influenced by punk is alternative rock but it's listed under 1990s. So perhaps the answer isn't explicitly provided but maybe the closest is alternative rock even though it's a bit late.  Wait no looking again: ""From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate... in the form of grunge Britpop and indie rock."" So alternative rock was emerging into the mainstream by the early '90s. Therefore in the mid-'80s it's still more about punk influencing others.  Alternatively perhaps the question refers to ""basic"" as in simple popular without being too subgenrespecific. Maybe hard rock or something else? But the context doesn't mention anything specific from that era except punk and its influences.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this again. The user is asking for a type of basic rock popular in the 1980s and based on the context alternative rock was influenced by punk but wasn't dominant until later. So perhaps the answer isn't explicitly given but if forced to pick from the options provided in the '90s (grunge Britpop indie) maybe grunge is a type of rock popular then.  But actually looking back at the context: ""Further fusion subgenres have since emerged including pop punk electronic rock rap rock and rap metal..."" So these are more recent. The context doesn't mention basic rock from the '80s except perhaps alternative as being influenced by punk.  Wait but the initial part says that in 1960s various subgenres led to psychedelic rock. Then in 70s punk came up then 80s saw punk influence new wave post-punk and alternative rock. So maybe alternative rock is considered basic here because it's the result of punk's influence.  But since the question asks for a type popular in '80s which was influenced by punk but wasn't dominant until later perhaps the answer is that alternative rock started to gain traction then even if not fully dominating yet.  Alternatively maybe ""basic"" refers to simple rock without subgenres. But I'm getting stuck here because the context doesn't clearly state a basic rock genre in '80s; it's more about punk influencing others.  Wait perhaps looking at the first part: ""By the late 1960s... many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock..."" Then in 70s countercultural scene led to punk. So by 80s punk was rising and influencing other genres like new wave and post-punk but alternative rock isn't clearly listed as dominant until later.  So maybe the answer is that basic rock wasn't a main genre then; instead it's influenced by punk into alternative. But since the question asks for an example perhaps grunge could be considered as alternative rock popular in '90s but not in '80s.  Wait no the context says grunge was dominant from 1990s onward. So maybe the answer is that there wasn't a basic rock genre then; instead the influence shifted towards alternative and new wave.  But I'm supposed to provide a concise answer based on the context given. Let me check: The context lists new wave post-punk and alternative rock as being influenced by punk in 1980s. So perhaps ""alternative rock"" is considered popular then.  Wait but the question asks for a type of basic rock which might imply more mainstream or foundational. Since alternative rock wasn't dominant until later maybe it's not the right answer.  Alternatively perhaps the term ""basic rock"" refers to raw unadorned rock without subgenres but that's not explicitly stated in the context either.  Given all this confusion I think the best approach is to pick the genre mentioned as influenced by punk and emerging from '80s: alternative rock. But since it was more prominent later maybe ""alternative"" isn't correct.  Wait no looking at the exact wording: ""punk had an influence in the 1980s on new wave post-punk and eventually alternative rock."" So alternative rock is influenced by punk but started to take off later. However the question asks for what was popular then so maybe it's more about alternative rock emerging from that influence.  But since I have to pick one answer perhaps ""alternative rock"" is the closest fit even if it's technically not dominant in '80s.  alternative rock",alternative rock,alternative rock,1,1.0,13.260307600008673,0.004719832816000188,0.0013858400969166157,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when was the last time an american won the new york marathon
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the last American won the New York Marathon based on the provided context. Let me go through the data step by step.  First looking at each year listed from 1972 onwards I'm specifically looking for entries where the winner's country is United States. Once I find that note down the year and the runner's name along with their time because sometimes there are multiple winners in a single year if they tie or something.  Starting from 1972: The winner is Nina Kuscsik from the United States with a course record of 3:08:41. That seems to be the first American win so I'll keep that as a possible candidate but continue checking for later years.  Moving forward:  - 1973: Again Nina Kuscsik wins again with another course record and also secures second place. But it's still an American.   - 1976: Miki Gorman from the U.S. so that's another win by an American.  - 1977: She wins again but this time she gets a second victory which I'm not sure if multiple people can have the same first name. But it's still an American win.  Looking further:  - In 1980 and 1981 Allison Roe from New Zealand won in 1980 then Miki Gorman again in 1981 with a course record.  Wait I'm looking for the last time an American won. So I need to check all the years beyond that.  Looking at each year:  - In 2005: Jeļena Prokopčuka from Latvia wins.   - 2006: She wins again another Latvian victory.  Then in 2007 and 2008 Paula Radcliffe from the U.K. won both times with her third and maybe fourth victories?  Wait but looking at the data provided:  In 1984 to 1986: Grete Waitz from Norway multiple times.  Looking into more recent years:  - In 2005 Jeļena Prokopčuka (Latvia) - 2006: Jeļena again with a second victory.   Then in 2007 and 2008: Paula Radcliffe twice from the UK. So no American wins there.  But wait looking through more recent years beyond that:  Looking at the list provided by the user I see entries up to 2019 or so. Let me check each year for US winners.  Wait actually let's go step by step as per the context:  The data continues from 2005 onwards.  - 2005: Jeļena Prokopčuka (Latvia) - 2006: Jeļena again - 2007: Paula Radcliffe (UK) second victory - 2008: Paula Radcliffe third victory - 2009: Derartu Tulu (Ethiopia) and Edna Kiplagat (Kenya) - 2011: Firehiwot Dado (Ethiopia) - 2012:Cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy - 2013: Priscah Jeptoo (Kenya) - 2014: Mary Keitany (Kenya) first win in the marathon? Wait no. Wait looking at 2014:  ""Mary Keitany Kenya 2 : 25 : 07""  So that's an American? No wait Mary Keitany is Kenyan.  Wait so from 2014 onwards:   - 2015: Mary Keitany again with a second victory - 2016: She wins for the third time - 2017: Shalane Flanagan (USA) first US woman to win since 1977.  So in 2017 Shalane won. So that's an American.  Wait but when was she last? Let me check all years after Mary Keitany up to 2017:  Looking at the data provided by the user the last entry is 2017 with Shalane Flanagan from the USA winning her fifth time and first US woman since 1977.  So that's the latest American victory in the New York Marathon based on the context provided.

Question: who was the top scorer in 2014 world cup
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the top scorer was at the 2014 World Cup based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.  The context mentions several statistics about players from different positions like goals scored assists clean sheets etc. It lists players such as James Rodríguez Juan Cuadrado Toni Kroos Thomas Müller Jasper Cillessen Sergio Romero and others with specific stats attached to them.  Looking for the part that talks about top scorers would be key here. The question specifically asks for the top scorer in 2014 World Cup. I see a section that says ""Most goals scored by one player in a match"": it mentions Thomas Müller for Germany against Portugal scoring 3 goals and Xherdan Shaqiri for Switzerland against Honduras also with 3 goals.  So both Thomas Müller and Xherdan Shaqiri have the highest number of goals in a single match. Since the question is about who was the top scorer I need to see if there's any additional info on how they compare or if one stands out more than the other. The context doesn't provide further details on their overall performances beyond that specific match.  Given that both are tied at 3 goals in a single match and no other player has more than that either could be considered top scorers. However without more context like total career goals or performance across multiple matches it's hard to say definitively who was the overall top scorer. But since the question refers to ""the"" top scorer singular perhaps focusing on their individual performance in a key match would suffice.  So I think either Thomas Müller or Xherdan Shaqiri are the top scorers based on the context provided.

Context: In population dynamics and population ecology , overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment . The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot . For example , plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off . The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse , a crash or a die - off in which there is a decline in population density . The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed ' overshoot - and - collapse ' .
Question: when does a dieback or population crash occur
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when a dieback or population crash occurs based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context talks about population dynamics and ecology. It mentions that overshoot happens when a population temporarily exceeds its carrying capacity. Carrying capacity is like the maximum number of individuals an environment can support without degrading it. When this happens the environment usually has mechanisms to stop overshoot. The example given is plants regenerating only a few times after being overharvested before dying off.  The consequences of overshoot are called collapses crashes or die-offs which involve a decline in population density. So when a population's numbers drop significantly due to exceeding the environment's limits this leads to a crash or dieback.  So the question is asking when such events occur. From the context it's clear that this happens after the population exceeds its carrying capacity. Therefore a dieback or population crash occurs when a population exceeds its carrying capacity.

284,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: Cone cells , or cones , are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes ( e.g. the human eye ) . They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light , as opposed to rod cells , which work better in dim light . Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis , a 0.3 mm diameter rod - free area with very thin , densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina . There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula . The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935 . Oyster 's textbook ( 1999 ) cites work by Curcio et al. ( 1990 ) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina .
Question: where are the cones in the eye located
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the cones are located in the eye based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that cone cells are photoreceptor cells in the retina responsible for color vision and work best in bright light. They're densely packed in the fovea centralis which is a rod-free area with very thin and numerous cones. As we move towards the periphery of the retina their number decreases.  I remember from my biology classes that the retina has two main types of photoreceptor cells: rods and cones. Rods are more for low-light vision while cones handle color vision better in bright conditions.  The context mentions fovea centralis specifically as the area with a high concentration of cone cells. The fovea is also described as rod-free which makes sense because it's where detailed vision is needed like what you see when looking directly ahead or tracking an object.  Additionally while there are about six to seven million cones in total they're most concentrated towards the macula. Wait now I'm a bit confused. The context initially says fovea centralis has very thin and densely packed cones but then also mentions that cones are most concentrated at the macula. So both areas have high cone density—fovea for detail and macula for peripheral vision.  But the question is asking where the cones are located not how their number varies with location. The primary answer seems to be in the fovea centralis because it's explicitly mentioned as having ""very thin densely packed cones"" and being rod-free. However the context also notes that cones are most concentrated towards the macula.  Wait maybe I should clarify: is the macula considered part of the retina where cones are concentrated? Yes both fovea centralis and macula have high cone density. But the initial part says ""fovea centralis... very thin densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery."" So perhaps the main location emphasized is the fovea.  But wait another point: Osterberg found six million cones but Curcio et al. mention 4.5 million and 90 million rods. The context doesn't specify where exactly these numbers are from—whether it's the fovea or elsewhere.  Wait the question is simply asking where the cones are located. So based on the first part of the context: ""Cone cells ... densely packed in the fovea centralis... which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery."" Therefore the answer should be that cones are found mostly in the fovea centralis.  But wait again—the second paragraph says ""The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod cells in the human retina."" So this seems like a separate statement possibly providing supporting data on the number rather than location.  Thus combining all information: cones are located densely in fovea centralis with their numbers decreasing towards the periphery and they're most concentrated at both fovea and macula. However the primary answer is that cones are found mostly in the fovea centralis because it's specifically mentioned as having very thin and densely packed cones.  Wait but the context says ""there are about six to seven million cones... located towards the macula."" So maybe cones are concentrated at both areas? But perhaps the fovea is where they're more densely packed overall?  I think I need to be precise. The first paragraph states that cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis which quickly reduce as you move outward. So the primary location is the fovea.  The second part mentions that cones are most concentrated towards the macula—so maybe that's another area of high concentration but perhaps it's not explicitly stated to be as dense as the fovea.  So considering all this I think the answer is that cones are located in the fovea centralis. However since cones are also concentrated at the macula maybe both areas should be mentioned? But looking back the context says ""the fovea centralis... very thin densely packed cones which quickly reduce towards periphery."" So perhaps the main location is the fovea.  Wait but I'm getting conflicting information. Let me check again: first paragraph about fovea having many cones and decreasing to periphery; second paragraph about total number near 4.5 million in the retina overall with some specific numbers.  I think the key answer here is that cones are located mostly in the fovea centralis because it's where they're most densely packed.

Question: where does puerto rico's power come from
Answer: ",Alright I need to figure out where Puerto Rico gets its electricity from based on the provided context. Let me go through each power plant mentioned and note their sources.  Looking at the context:  1. AES Ilumina: 24 MW solar power private owner. 2. AES Corporation (I think this is part of the Combined Cycle): 592 MW heavy fuel oil publicly owned by PREPA. 3. PREPA's Aguirre: 900 MW Thermoelectric diesel oil source. 4. PREPA's Salinas Aguirre: 518 MW Natural gas private owner ( Gas Natural Fenosa ). 5. PREPA's Arecibo: 990 MW Heavy fuel oil publicly owned by PREPA. 6. PREPA's Guayanilla EcoEléctrica: 510 MW Natural gas private owner (Gas Natural Fenosa). 7. Sonnedix Isabela Palo Seco: 402 MW Combined Cycle diesel oil from PREPA and others. 8. Sonnedix Cataño Punta Lima: 602 MW Heavy fuel oil publicly owned by PREPA. 9. Combined Cycle plants in San Juan: Both 1 350 MW each with diesel oil source. 10. San Juan's Solar Farm: 46 MW solar power from Sonnedix. 11. San Juan's Thermoelectric plant: 2 200 MW heavy fuel oil from PREPA and others. 12. Wind farms in Punta Lima (Cataño) and Guayanilla: Both have wind energy sources.

Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out what the user is asking. They provided a context about the movie ""Action Jackson"" featuring Ajay Devgn and Sonakshi Sinha. The question is asking for their next movie. So first I should look through the context they gave.  In the context it says that ""Action Jackson"" was released in 2014. There's no mention of any other movies Ajay Devgn or Sonakshi Sinha have starred in besides this one. They also mention that Prabhu Deva and Ajay Devgn are working together for the first time in this film.  Since there's no information about their next projects I can't provide a specific answer. I should respond that based on the given context there's no information about any other movie they've directed or starred in besides ""Action Jackson."" It's possible they haven't released another film yet so it's safe to say the next one isn't known from this source.  There is no information available indicating if Ajay Devgn and Sonakshi Sinha have directed or starred in any new movie beyond ""Action Jackson"" as mentioned in the context.",there is no information available indicating if ajay devgn and sonakshi sinha have directed or starred in any new movie beyond action jackson as mentioned in context,Action Jackson,0,0.13793103448275862,2.197104399994714,0.0007516268846387257,0.0002206931294519022,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what level is a city and guilds qualification
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what level a City and Guilds qualification is based on the context provided. The context mentions that these qualifications are ""accredited by Ofqual and included on the Register of Regulated Qualifications.""   Hmm I know that Ofqual is the UK's regulatory body for qualifications. They must have assessed the City and Guilds qualifications against certain standards to get that accreditation. Now the Register includes a range of qualifications but there are different levels within that register.  I recall that City and Guilds qualifications can vary from Level 1 up to Level 8. Lower levels like Level 1 or 2 might be more introductory skills while higher levels say 7 or 8 are for more advanced or specialized skills in specific trades.   Since the question is asking what level a City and Guilds qualification is without additional context on which specific qualification it refers to I should mention that they can range from Level 1 to Level 8 depending on the subject area.

It was filmed in Seattle , Washington , site of the Century 21 Exposition , the 1962 World 's Fair . The governor of Washington at the time , Albert Rosellini , suggested the setting to Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer executives . The film made $2.25 million at the box office .
Question: where was it happened at the world fair filmed
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where ""It Happened at the World's Fair"" was filmed based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that the film is a musical starring Elvis Presley and is set as a cropdusting pilot. It was filmed in Seattle Washington. The site of the Century 21 Exposition which was the 1962 World's Fair. Also the governor of Washington at that time Albert Rosellini suggested the setting to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer executives. The film made $2.25 million at the box office.  So putting this together the key points are:  - Filmed in Seattle Washington. - Site of the Century 21 Exposition (which was a World's Fair). - Suggested by Albert Rosellini to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer executives. - Made $2.25 million at the box office.  The question is asking specifically where it happened at the world fair was filmed. From the context ""It Happened at the World's Fair"" is the title of the film and it's set during the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle because it's linked to the Century 21 Exposition there.  So putting that together the filming location is Seattle Washington. The mention about the governor and the executives is probably more about how they were involved in setting up the film location at the fair rather than where exactly it was filmed.

Question: where did chocolate originate the americas spain asia
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where chocolate originated based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by talking about the history of chocolate in Spain being part of Spain's culinary history since the 16th century. It mentions that cocoa was discovered in Mesoamerica during the colonization of the Americas. So right away I can note that Mesoamerica is where cocoa originated.  Then it goes on to discuss how cocoa was traded after the conquest of Mexico moving from Nueva España (which is Mexico City) to Spain's coast. However the specific details about when regular trade began are mentioned in the 17th century from Veracruz and onwards to Europe.  So putting this together: the context clearly states that the cocoa plant was discovered in Mesoamerica during the colonization period of the Americas. Therefore chocolate originated in Mesoamerica.  The other parts of the context mention Spain's role in trading cocoa after a certain date but don't change where it originally came from. So I can confidently say that chocolate originated in Mesoamerica.  Mesoamerica,mesoamerica,Mesoamerica,1,1.0,2.109588099992834,0.0007241507170833814,0.00021262556091881498,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who played hyde in league of extraordinary gentlemen
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who played Hyde in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."" The context mentions that Jason Flemyng plays Dr. Henry Jekyll/Hyde right? So the question is asking specifically about Hyde's actor.  Let me break this down. First the character names are Jekyll and Hyde but they're interchangeable as Dr. Frankenstein or just Hyde sometimes. In the play ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen "" which is adapted from the novel by Ambrose Bierce there are two main characters: Hyde and Jekyll.  Now focusing on who plays Hyde in this specific production. The context directly states that Jason Flemyng plays Dr. Henry Jekyll/Hyde. That's pretty clear—Flemyng is playing both roles. But the question specifically asks about Hyde. So since he's playing both I can assume he's taking on the role of Hyde as well.  Wait a second does that mean he's playing both in separate parts? Like sometimes Jekyll and sometimes Hyde? Or is he switching between them during the performance? The context doesn't specify if it's an ensemble cast or just him handling both roles. But regardless since the question asks for who plays Hyde and he's playing Dr. Henry Jekyll/Hyde I can confidently say he's also playing Hyde.  So putting it all together the answer should be Jason Flemyng as Hyde in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."" That seems straightforward based on the provided context.

Question: what is the average salary for a us congressman
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the average salary for a U.S. congressman based on the data provided in the context. Let me start by looking through the information given.  I see that there are multiple years listed from 1789 all the way up to 2017. Each year has different denominations mentioned like ""¢ per diem "" ""$1 per diem only "" and various dollar amounts with some being annual or per annum. It looks like the salaries vary quite a bit over time.  First I'll try to identify which of these are actual annual salaries because the question is about the average salary for a congressman. I notice that in 2017 it's mentioned as ""$174 000 per annum"" with some dashes before and after so I think that's the most recent data point.  Looking through the years other entries include specific amounts like $3 000 $5 000 up to over $200 000. These seem to be annual salaries for different periods or perhaps adjusted values with percentages attached. For example in 1987 there's a mention of ""1 / 1"" and ""$77 400 per annum."" I'm not entirely sure what the fractions mean here but they might represent something like a single increment or adjustment.  Since the data spans from 1789 to 2017 it includes multiple salary figures. However without specific information on how many years each salary pertains to or any indication of averaging across those years it's challenging to compute an exact average.   The last entry in 2017 is the most recent and seems significant because it specifies ""$174 000 per annum."" Given that perhaps this is the current salary being referenced making it the average we're looking for.  So considering the context and trying to find a consistent salary figure without any adjustments or missing years the 2017 salary stands out as $174 000 per annum. I'll go with that as the average salary for a U.S. congressman based on the provided data.  The average salary for a U.S. congressman according to the most recent data provided in 2017 is:  **$174 000 per annum**",174000 per annum,"$174,000",0,0.5,4.273625499990885,0.0014991497271112958,0.0004401812276209136,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who got the most passing yards in the nfl
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who has the most passing yards in the NFL based on the provided context. Let me look through the data step by step.  First I see that the table lists players along with their teams and seasons as well as their passing yards. The question is asking for the player with the highest passing yards.   Looking at the numbers Eli Manning has 51 682 yards. Hmm that seems like a lot but let me check if any other player has more than that.   Next Brett Favre has 71 838 yards which is significantly higher. Then there's Drew Brees with 70 445 which is also quite high. Tom Brady comes next with 66 159.   Wait a minute Eli Manning actually has the highest number here at 51 682? That doesn't seem right because I know Brett Favre and Drew Brees are more famous quarterbacks known for their passing yards. Maybe I'm misreading the numbers.  Let me double-check the data:  - Brett Favre: 71 838 - Drew Brees: 70 445 - Tom Brady: 66 159 - Eli Manning: 51 682  So according to this table Brett Favre is first with the most yards. But I thought Eli Manning was a very good quarterback. Maybe there's an error in the data or perhaps the context isn't complete?   Wait looking again at Eli Manning's entry it says he has 51 682 yards from 2004 to present. That might be correct because Manning is known for his long career and consistent performance. But the other numbers suggest Brett Favre leads with 71k yards.  I think I need to confirm who actually holds the record in reality because this data might not be up-to-date or accurate beyond certain years. From what I know Brett Favre was a legend but Eli Manning also had an impressive career. However based on the numbers here Brett Favre has more passing yards.  So according to this context Brett Favre is the player with the most passing yards.  Brett Favre accumulated the highest number of passing yards at 71 838 in the NFL based on the provided data.,brett favre accumulated highest number of passing yards at 71838 in nfl based on provided data,Peyton Manning,0,0.0,4.59146850000252,0.0016157207175220268,0.00047440887062149287,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what is the movie dazed and confused about
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out what the movie ""Dazed and Confused"" is about based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.  The context mentions that in September 1993 St. Martin's Press published a softcover book inspired by Richard Linklater's screenplay. This book was compiled by Linklater Denise Montgomery and others designed by Erik Josowitz. It was presented as a kind of yearbook with character profiles essays by characters a timeline focusing on the years 1973 to 1977 various 1970s pop culture charts and quizzes and featured black-and-white photos from the film.  Wait so this is about a book that's compiling information about ""Dazed and Confused "" right? The movie itself was released in 1995. So the context here isn't directly talking about the movie but rather a companion book to it. That means if I'm looking for details about the movie from this context there might be some indirect clues.  However none of the provided sentences actually mention anything specific about the plot or themes of ""Dazed and Confused."" The information given is more about the creation of a related book rather than the movie itself. So based on this context alone I can't extract any details about what the movie was about.   I know that from other sources ""Dazed and Confused"" is a coming-of-age film about a young man's attempt to escape his mundane life in a small town by joining a rock band. It deals with themes of self-discovery personal growth and finding one's identity through music. But since this context doesn't provide that information I can't confirm it here.  So the answer would be that there isn't enough information provided in the given context to determine what ""Dazed and Confused"" is about.  The movie ""Dazed and Confused"" is not addressed in the provided context. However based on general knowledge it is a coming-of-age film about self-discovery through music.

Context: In the long term , the attack on Pearl Harbor was a grand strategic blunder for Japan . Indeed , Admiral Yamamoto , who conceived it , predicted even success here could not win a war with the United States , because American productive capacity was too large . It spurred the United States into a determination to fight to complete victory . The war resulted in the destruction of the Japanese armed forces , the occupation of the home islands ( a state never before achieved in Japan 's history ) , and the occupation of Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands by the United States until 1972 , while the Soviet Russian re-annexation of the Kurile Islands and Sakhalin Island 's southern part , and the restoration of Formosa ( Taiwan ) to China , and the loss of Korea have not been reversed to this day .
Question: who declared war on the united states four days after pearl harbor
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who declared war on the United States four days after Pearl Harbor based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.  The context talks about the attack on Pearl Harbor and mentions that Admiral Yamamoto conceived the attack. It says that this was a strategic blunder for Japan and that it spurred the U.S. into determination to fight for victory.   Looking further down the context states: ""The war resulted in..."" Wait but when? The context goes on to talk about what happened after the attack like destruction of Japanese armed forces occupation of home islands etc. but I'm trying to find who declared war four days later.  Hmm maybe I missed it. Let me check again. It says ""The attack resulted in..."" and then mentions the destruction of the Japanese armed forces occupation of Okinawa and Ryukyu Islands by the U.S. until 1972 and other events. But who declared war? The context doesn't explicitly mention a declaration of war four days after Pearl Harbor.  Wait perhaps it's implied because the attack led to the continuation or declaration of war. Since Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7 1941 maybe the U.S. was already at war with Japan before that date. But the question is about who declared war four days after Pearl Harbor.  I think I'm overcomplicating it. The context doesn't specify which country declared war; it just mentions that Japan's attack resulted in certain outcomes. So perhaps the answer isn't provided here but from historical knowledge I know that the U.S. was already at war with Japan when Pearl Harbor was attacked.  Wait no maybe the question is referring to who besides Japan declared war on the U.S. like the U.S. declaring war on Japan? But in this context it's talking about Japanese declaration of war leading to certain outcomes not the U.S.'s declaration.  This is confusing. The context doesn't directly answer who declared war four days after Pearl Harbor; perhaps I should look for any mentions of a declaration in the given text.  Wait no the context provided talks about Japan attacking Pearl Harbor and the consequences on Japanese forces and occupation but it doesn't mention when the U.S. or anyone else declared war beyond that point.  So maybe the answer isn't here but if I have to answer based on this perhaps it's not provided. But given that the question is expecting an answer I might need to infer from known events.   Wait in reality after Pearl Harbor the U.S. was already at war with Japan since 1940 when they entered into the Open Pacific Policy. So maybe the declaration of war by the U.S. on Japan happened before Pearl Harbor.  But the question is asking who declared war four days after Pearl Harbor. If I think historically the U.S. had already declared war on Japan in April 1941 (during WWII) so perhaps the answer isn't given here but from general knowledge it's the United States themselves declaring war on Japan before Pearl Harbor.  But wait maybe the context is implying that someone else declared war after Pearl Harbor like another country? But I don't see any mention of other countries in this context.  I'm a bit stuck. Since the context provided doesn't specify who declared war four days after Pearl Harbor perhaps it's not included. However from general knowledge the U.S. had already been at war with Japan since 1940 so maybe the answer is that no one did; they continued fighting.  But I'm probably overcomplicating it. The context might just be focusing on the Japanese actions leading to their defeat not necessarily who else acted. So perhaps the answer isn't provided in the given text and needs historical knowledge beyond what's given.  The question asks for the entity that declared war on the United States four days after Pearl Harbor but the provided context does not explicitly mention this. From general historical knowledge the United States was already at war with Japan prior to Pearl Harbor's attack on December 7 1941. Therefore no additional declaration of war by a fourth party is mentioned in the context.

Question: when do you get a dd form 214
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when someone gets a DD Form 214. From what I remember the question is asking about the timing after military service like when the discharge or retirement happens. The context mentioned that it's issued upon retirement separation or discharge from active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces.  Wait so does that mean the person gets the DD 214 at the same time as their discharge? I think yes because it's part of the process after serving. So the answer should be when someone retires is separated or discharged.

Adelaide was widely tipped to slide out of the finals in 2016 but the Crows proved to be one of the successes of the season , comfortably qualifying for a home elimination final and defeating North Melbourne by 62 points , before being eliminated the next week by eventual beaten grand finalists , Sydney in the semi-finals . The club had a dominant 2017 season , winning their opening six games and never falling below second place for the entire season . Adelaide claimed their second McClelland Trophy as minor premiers . The Adelaide Crows entered the 2017 finals series as favourites for the premiership ; they defeated Greater Western Sydney and Geelong by 36 and 61 points respectively to qualify for the Grand Final , their first since 1998 , where they faced Richmond . Despite starting as favourites , the Crows lost the match by 48 points .
Question: when was the last time the crows were in the grand final
Answer: ",Alright I need to figure out when the Adelaide Crows were in the Grand Final. Let's go through the context step by step.  First the context talks about Patrick Dangerfield leaving the club at the end of the 2015 season which was a great one for them because he won the 'best and fairest' award. Then it moves on to Don Pyke being appointed as the senior coach starting from 2016.  Next there's information about Adelaide's performance in 2016. They were tipped to drop out of the finals that year but despite that they had a successful season. They qualified for the home elimination final and won against North Melbourne by a large margin. Although they lost the next week to Sydney in the semi-finals they still made it to the Grand Final.  The following section details their 2017 season which was very dominant. They won their first six games and stayed above second place throughout the season winning the McClelland Trophy as minor premiers. In the finals series that year they defeated Greater Western Sydney and Geelong but lost to Richmond in the Grand Final.  So putting this together: The Crows had a 2016 season leading up to the Grand Final. They made it into the finals that year before losing. Then in 2017 despite being favorites they also made it to the Grand Final but lost again.  Wait let me make sure I'm not mixing up the years. The context says they were tipped to slide out of the finals in 2016 but ended up qualifying for the Grand Final that same year before losing in the semi-finals. Then in 2017 they made it further into the finals as favorites but lost again.  So the last time they were in the Grand Final would be the 2017 season.

The Music Room on the first floor was never finished , so it was used for storage until 1944 , when the possibility of an attack became more remote .

The city of Asheville requested it to attract tourism hoping it would revitalize the area.  Wait so they opened it in 1930? That seems straightforward.

But then there's a mention of Sammi Smith later in 1970 covering the song. The context also notes that Sammi Smith's recording is more commercially successful and well-known in the US and it topped both country and pop charts.

Then later Sammi Smith covered it which became more popular beyond just country charts to also pop charts.   I need to make sure I'm not mixing up the versions.

Question: what episode does luffy get to fishman island
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out which episode of ""One Piece"" involves Luffy going to Fishman Island. First I'll recall that in the anime and manga Fishman Island is a key location where many important events happen as the story moves towards the New World.  I remember that when Luffy initially visits Fishman Island it's during his early days with the Straw Hats. He goes there to find Panz Fry who was captured by Marines. This episode is crucial because it sets up the conflict between Luffy and Shuzo later on.  Looking through the list of episodes provided I see that there are several mentions related to Fishman Island:  1. **""Z's Ambition! A Dark and Powerful Army!""** (December 9 2012) - This is part 4 in the Z's Ambition series. In this episode Luffy teams up with others to rescue Panz Fry from Shuzo. So it definitely involves Fishman Island.  I don't see any other episodes listed that mention Fishman Island besides this one. Even though I know there are more Fishman Island arcs later in the series (like in ""Part 2"" and ""Part 3"") the user provided specific episodes and only part 4 is mentioned here.  Therefore the episode where Luffy goes to Fishman Island based on the provided list is **Episode 576**.  The episode where Luffy visits Fishman Island is:  **Answer:** Episode 576: ""Z's Ambition! A Dark and Powerful Army!""",answer episode 576 zs ambition dark and powerful army,Landing at the Fish-Man Island!

Question: who appoints the chair of the federal reserve system
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who appoints the chair of the Federal Reserve System based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The first sentence says ""The chair is chosen by the President of the United States from among the members of the Board of Governors; and serves for four-year terms after appointment."" So it's clear that the President appoints the Chair from the Board of Governors.   Then it mentions that a chair can be appointed for several consecutive terms which means they don't have to serve only one term. The example given is William Martin who served from 1951 to 1970—that's like over eight years so definitely multiple terms.  So putting this together the key point is that the President appoints the Chair each time. Therefore the answer should be straightforward: the President of the United States appoints the chair.

Question: who are the australia's got talent judges
Answer: ",Alright I need to figure out who the judges were for Australia's Got Talent. The context provided has a list of season starts and finishes along with names like Bonnie Anderson Herb Patten Grant Denyer etc. Each entry seems to include details about each season.  I should go through each season listed in the context to identify all the judges involved. Let me start from Season 1:  Season 1: Start - February 2007 Finish - April 2007 Winner - Bonnie Anderson Hosts mentioned are Herb Patten Grant Denyer Dannii Minogue and a few others like Tom Burlinson and Red Symons. The judges listed here include Mark Whouse as a judge for that season.  Season 2: Start - April 2008 to July 2008. Judges mentioned are Smokin' Joe Robinson Jourdain and others like Josh Jones.  Wait in the context given Season 2's judges aren't explicitly listed beyond the host names. I might need to infer or check if they have standard judges for that period.  But looking further each season seems to list specific judges at the end of their entry. For example Season 5 has Jack Vidgen and Cosentino as judges. So perhaps all the judges are listed after their respective seasons.  I should compile a list of all unique names mentioned across all seasons without duplicates.  Let me extract all the judge names from each season:  1. Season 1: Mark Vincent 2. Season 2: Not explicitly listed but might have standard judges; context doesn't provide specifics beyond host names so maybe not included. 3. Season 3: Mark Vincent Jal Joshua 4. Season 4: Not specified in the provided context 5. Season 5: Jack Vidgen Cosentino 6. Season 6: Andrew De Silva The Wolfe Brothers 7. Season 7: Uncle Jed Greg Gould Julia Morris Geri Halliwell 8. Season 8: Fletcher Pilon  I notice that some seasons' judges aren't detailed in the provided context beyond host names or specific pairs. Therefore based on the given data the judges are Mark Vincent (Seasons 1 and 3) Jack Vidgen & Cosentino (Season 5) Andrew De Silva & The Wolfe Brothers (Season 6) Uncle Jed Greg Gould Julia Morris Geri Halliwell (Season 7) and Fletcher Pilon (Season 8).  So compiling all these into a list without duplicates gives the complete set of judges.

309,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: Zonda wind ( on the eastern slope of the Andes in Argentina )
Question: dry cold wind in south america that blows south west from the andes to the atlantic
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what kind of wind this is based on the given context. The user provided a specific location and some information about the wind direction.  First the context mentions ""Zonda wind"" in Argentina on the eastern slope of the Andes. That probably refers to Zonda frontal systems or fronts that form near the Andes Mountains. These are typically cold air masses because they're associated with mountainous regions which often lead to lower temperatures and higher pressure areas.  The wind is described as a ""dry cold wind"" blowing from the south-west towards the Atlantic Ocean in South America. So Zonda winds are usually dry and come from areas where the sea surface temperature is low causing the air to sink rather than rise. This sinking makes the air denser and cools down which explains why these winds are often associated with mountainous regions.  Putting this together it's clear that Zonda wind in this context refers to a cold dry wind originating from the Andes moving southwest towards the Atlantic. Since it originates over the Andes it's likely part of the planetary boundary layer and interacts with the larger atmospheric circulation systems.  The Zonda wind is a dry cold frontal wind originating from the eastern slope of the Andes in Argentina blowing south-west towards the Atlantic Ocean.", zonda wind is dry cold frontal wind originating from eastern slope of andes in argentina blowing southwest towards atlantic ocean,"Garua, la garúa, or garoa",0,0.0,2.262842299998738,0.0007729228518077399,0.00022694606390021393,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: In political philosophy , limited government is where the government is empowered by law from a starting point of having no power , or where governmental power is restricted by law , usually in a written constitution . It is a key concept in the history of liberalism . The United States Constitution presents an example of the federal government not possessing any power except what is delegated to it by the Constitution - with the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution specifically stating that powers not specifically delegated to the federal government is reserved for the people and the states . The Magna Carta and the United States Constitution also represents important milestones in the limiting of governmental power . The earliest use of the term limited government dates back to King James VI and I in the late 16th century . Limited government put into practice often involves the protection of individual liberty from government intrusion .
Question: the main idea of limited government is that
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the main idea of limited government based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The first sentence defines limited government as where the government has its power only from a written constitution and usually starts with no power at all. It's associated with liberalism. The US Constitution is an example reserving most powers to the states or individuals under the Tenth Amendment. Also mentions the Magna Carta as an important milestone in limiting power.  The earliest use of the term dates back to King James VI. Limited government involves protecting individual liberty from government intrusion.  Putting this together it seems that limited government is about restricting the government's power through laws and constitutions particularly at the federal level leaving most power to states or individuals. The main idea would be that governments don't have too much power beyond what's written in the constitution.  The main idea of limited government is that governmental power is restricted by law typically through a written constitution reserving most power to the states or individuals under such frameworks like the US Constitution and the Tenth Amendment., main idea of limited government is that governmental power is restricted by law typically through written constitution reserving most power to states or individuals under such frameworks like us constitution and tenth amendment,"government is empowered by law from a starting point of having no power, or where governmental power is restricted by law, usually in a written constitution",0,0.38596491228070173,2.0148346000059973,0.0006840576691723036,0.00020085341652962941,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who was the book of philippians written to
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the letter Paul wrote to is based on the given context. The context mentions that it's from Philippi and talks about Paul writing a letter there. It also references other parts like 2 Corinthians and 2 Thessalonians.  First the context says the letter was written ""to the church at Philippi "" which are some of the earliest churches in Europe. They were very attached to Paul just as he was fond of them. So that's pretty straightforward—Paul is addressing his church in Philippi.  Looking further the context mentions contributions from the Philippians which Paul gratefully acknowledges and accepts. Also there's a reference to 2 Corinthians 11:7-12 where Paul thanks them. Additionally 2 Thessalonians 3:8 is mentioned as another place where Paul is thanked.  Another part of the context talks about the generosity of the Philippians being evident in their support for the mission work. It also mentions that 2 Corinthians 8 and 9 prove this but the main focus is on Philippi itself.

Question: what kind of trees have heart shaped leaves
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out which trees have heart-shaped leaves based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  Looking at each tree and its description:  - Linden has obliquely heart-shaped leaves. - Elm also has obliquely heart-shaped leaves. - Hackberry's leaves are doubly serrate but not heart-shaped. - Birch is mentioned with specific features nothing about hearts. - American Hornbeam repand with spiny teeth; no mention of shape. - Black locust has a quivering habit and petioles compressed; not heart-shaped. - Poplar is long and slender with finely serrate leaves; doesn't fit. - Willow is coarsely crenately-toothed so definitely not heart-shaped. - Chestnut oak's margins are lobed or slightly indented but no hearts. - Witch-hazel has serrate leaves not heart-shaped. - Plum Cherry etc. have serrate or lobed leaves; none are heart-shaped.  Wait let me double-check. The context mentions Linden and Elm as having obliquely heart-shaped leaves which is a variation of heart shape but not exactly the same. However in botany ""heart-shaped"" often refers to oblique triangular shapes that give it an appearance similar to a heart when viewed from above.  So Linden and Elm are likely the correct answers.

Question: where did the british empire control an entire continent
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the British Empire controlled an entire continent based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The first part talks about political boundaries not reflecting homogeneous ethnicities or religions leading to conflicts in former colonies. Then it mentions that the British Empire was responsible for large migrations of people. Settlers from Britain and Ireland ended up in places like the US Canada Australia New Zealand among others. There are tensions between white settlers and indigenous minorities especially in South Africa and Zimbabwe.  It also notes that settlers in Ireland have left their mark in Northern Ireland as divided communities. People moved to and from British colonies; Indians went to Malaysia and Fiji while Chinese people moved to Malaysia Singapore and the Caribbean. After WWII Britain's demographics changed due to immigration from its former colonies.  Now the question is asking where the British Empire controlled an entire continent. From the context I see mentions of specific countries: United States Canada Australia New Zealand and also Malaysia Fiji for Indians and Singapore the Caribbean for Chinese. However these are individual countries spread across different continents—North America (US Canada) Oceania (Australia New Zealand Fiji Malaysia) and Asia (Singapore Caribbean).  Wait but the question is about an entire continent. So I need to check if any single continent was entirely under British control. From what I recall in the 19th and early 20th centuries Britain had dominions across multiple continents especially Oceania.  Looking back at the context: The British Empire expanded into many parts of the world during the 19th century. For example Australia and New Zealand were part of the British Empire before Federation in 1890. Similarly Malaysia was a British dominion until 1965 when it gained independence.  But wait are there entire continents where Britain controlled all of them? Let's think about Europe first—the UK itself is on the continent of Europe but after WWII Ireland and Northern Ireland were part of the Commonwealth. However I don't think Britain controlled an entire continent like Asia or Africa entirely during that time.  Wait perhaps it was Oceania where Britain had a significant presence before independence movements in countries like Australia New Zealand Malaysia etc. leading to their independence from Britain.  So putting it all together the British Empire did not control any single entire continent because they lost control over many of their colonies after independence movements. However the question is asking where they controlled an entire continent. Maybe I'm missing something here.  Wait another angle: The context mentions that after WWII the demographics of Britain changed due to immigration from its former colonies. This suggests that post-WWII Britain's population included people from other continents like Asia and Oceania through immigration.  But originally before independence did Britain control an entire continent? Let me think about when Britain controlled parts of Oceania. Australia and New Zealand were under British rule until they became independent in 1890s. But Malaysia was a dominion owned by Britain since the early 20th century but gained independence later.  Wait perhaps the British Empire did not control an entire continent entirely as many of their colonies gained independence over time. So maybe the answer is that they didn't control any single continent entirely after their decline.  Alternatively maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It might be asking if there's a continent where all the current countries were part of Britain at some point which doesn't seem to be the case either because many are now independent and not under British rule.  Wait but in pre-independence times parts of Oceania like Australia and New Zealand were controlled by Britain. So perhaps it's that the British Empire controlled parts of continents but no entire continent was theirs without interruption after independence.  Hmm this is a bit confusing. Let me try to recall historical facts: The British Empire encompassed various parts of Africa the Middle East Southeast Asia (before independence) Oceania and North America as colonies before independence movements in the mid-20th century led to their independence from Britain.  So perhaps no entire continent was under British control without interruption after a certain point. But during expansion they controlled parts of continents like Oceania but not an entire continent since that would require controlling all countries within it today which isn't the case because many are independent now.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking where the British Empire controlled an entire continent. Given the context provided perhaps it's referring to Oceania as a whole before independence. But after that no. Alternatively maybe the answer is that they didn't control any entire continent because of their decline and colonies gaining independence.  Wait but looking at the options within the context: The mention of Malaysia as an example where Chinese people moved in suggests that Britain's influence was spread across multiple continents without controlling a single one entirely after independence. So perhaps the correct answer is that they didn't control any entire continent because all their colonies gained independence and thus lost British control.  But maybe I'm missing something else. Wait perhaps during their expansion before 1947 (when Australia New Zealand etc. became independent) the UK controlled parts of Oceania as a whole. So the answer might be that they controlled parts of Oceania entirely until independence.  The British Empire did not control an entire continent without interruption after its decline and colonies gained independence in the mid-20th century. However during their expansion before 1947 Britain controlled parts of Oceania as a whole., british empire did not control entire continent without interruption after its decline and colonies gained independence in mid20th century however during their expansion before 1947 britain controlled parts of oceania as whole,Australia,0,0.0,9.18186969999806,0.003238850297786461,0.0009509931358938668,0.0,0.0,0.0

According to Ice Cube , who starred in the film and co-wrote its script , `` Bye , Felicia '' is `` the phrase ' to get anyone out of your face ' , '' and , as it was used in the Friday scene , is generally intended as a dismissive kiss - off .
Question: where does the phrase good bye felicia come from
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out where the phrase ""Goodbye Felicia"" comes from. Let me start by looking at the context provided. The user mentioned that in the movie ""Friday "" a scene used the phrase ""Bye Felicia."" Wait but they also note that it's spelled ""Felisha"" in the cast listing.  Okay so first off I know ""Felicia"" is a character from an old animated series called The Fairly OddParents. But here it seems to be part of a different context entirely—specifically tied to a movie. The user mentions that this phrase comes from the 1995 film ""Friday "" which is a buddy crime comedy with Ice Cube in it.  So putting this together: ""Bye Felicia"" was used by Ice Cube's character. According to him it's meant as a dismissive kiss-off. But I also noticed that in the cast listing it's spelled ""Felisha."" Hmm so maybe there's an inconsistency here—either the name is misspelled or perhaps they're referencing another context where Felicia is part of the dialogue.  Wait but the main point is to find out where ""Goodbye Felicia"" comes from. So focusing on the information given it seems that in the movie ""Friday "" Ice Cube uses this phrase as a dismissive way to get someone's attention or leave them alone. The context connects it specifically to the film and Ice Cube's interpretation.  However considering that ""Felicia"" is part of an animated show I know but here it's tied to a movie scene maybe in the movie there's a character named Felicia who he dismisses with this phrase. So ""Goodbye Felicia"" would be him saying that to someone else as a form of leaving them alone.  I should make sure not to confuse this with the animated show context because the user is clearly referring to the movie here. So in summary the phrase comes from the 1995 film ""Friday "" used by Ice Cube's character as a dismissive phrase.  The phrase ""Goodbye Felicia"" originates from the 1995 American buddy crime comedy film ""Friday."" Ice Cube who starred in and co-wrote the script of the film uses it as a dismissive way to get someone's attention or leave them alone.", phrase goodbye felicia originates from 1995 american buddy crime comedy film friday ice cube who starred in and cowrote script of film uses it as dismissive way to get someones attention or leave them alone,came from a scene in the American stoner buddy crime comedy film Friday (1995),0,0.3829787234042553,3.904318000000785,0.0013631933187785213,0.0004002616267694584,0.0,0.0,0.0

The context mentions that the series is filmed on the French island of Guadeloupe in the Lesser Antilles. It specifically states that most filming takes place in the commune of Deshaies which doubles for the town of Honoré on the fictional island of Saint Marie. There's a note about the site of the Honoré police station being a church hall in Deshaies with the priest's office appearing as the incident room.  So putting this together the main filming location is Guadeloupe particularly in Deshaies. This area is used to represent Honoré on Saint Marie. The specific building used for the police station is a church hall indicating that Deshaies is the key location for filming various scenes of the show.

Question: when do luke and lorelai get back together
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out when Luke and Lorelai get back together in the context of this question. The context provided is a list of dates:  - December 13 2005 - January 18 2010 - August 16 2006 - January 24 2007 - September 6 2006  Hmm these dates don't seem to be directly related to Luke and Lorelai's relationship. Maybe they are from a show or movie where their relationship had different outcomes on certain episodes? Since the user is asking about when they get back together after being apart perhaps each date represents an episode where they are together again.  But looking at these dates I don't immediately recognize any of them as specific events in Luke and Lorelai's story. Maybe these are random references from different shows or parts of a larger narrative. Without more context about which show or movie this is from it's hard to pinpoint the exact answer.  I should consider that each date might correspond to an episode release date but even then without knowing the series I can't be sure. Alternatively these could be significant dates in their relationship history like proposing marriage on December 13 2005 or a divorce announcement later.  Given the lack of clarity and specific information about which show this refers to it's challenging to provide an accurate answer. It might be best to ask for more context or clarify where these dates are from so I can assist better.  The provided dates do not correspond to any known events in the Luke and Lorelai storyline. Without additional context about the source of these dates (e.g. a specific show movie or narrative) it's impossible to determine when they reunite.

Context: Electromyography ( EMG ) is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles . EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph to produce a record called an electromyogram . An electromyograph detects the electric potential generated by muscle cells when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated . The signals can be analyzed to detect medical abnormalities , activation level , or recruitment order , or to analyze the biomechanics of human or animal movement .
Question: what features of muscle contraction can be determined from an emg (electromyogram)
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what features of muscle contraction can be determined from an EMG which is an electromyogram. Let me start by recalling what I know about EMG.  EMG measures the electrical activity produced by muscles when they contract. From the context given it says that EMGs can detect things like activation levels and recruitment order. Activation level refers to how active a muscle is at any given time right? So if you're lifting weights or doing some exercise EMG can tell which muscles are contracting and how hard.  Recruitment order also comes up. I think this means the sequence in which muscles are used during movement. For example when you lift an object your body might start with the most relevant muscles first then add others as needed. So EMGs could show that order of muscle activation.  The context also mentions biomechanics analysis. That makes me think EMG can help understand how muscles contribute to movement mechanics like the force and range of motion in joints. But wait is that directly a feature or more about interpreting the data?  Also EMG can detect medical abnormalities. So things like nerve damage muscle disorders or injuries would leave characteristic patterns in the EMG signals. That's another feature.  But I'm not sure if all these aspects are features of muscle contraction itself or more about how it's analyzed. The question is specifically asking what features of muscle contraction can be determined from an EMG so maybe I should focus on the direct outputs.  Putting this together EMGs can show activation levels (how much each muscle is contracting) recruitment order (the sequence in which muscles activate during movement) and any abnormalities or disorders affecting muscle function. Biomechanics analysis is more about applying that data to understand movement rather than a feature of the contraction itself.  So I think the main features are activation level recruitment order and medical abnormalities.  From an EMG you can determine:  1. **Activation Levels**: The intensity of muscle contraction at any given moment. 2. **Recruitment Order**: The sequence in which muscles activate during movement. 3. **Medical Abnormalities**: Patterns indicating nerve or muscle disorders.

Context: Before the 16th century , harvest was the term usually used to refer to the season , as it is common in other West Germanic languages to this day ( cf . Dutch herfst , German Herbst and Scots hairst ) . However , as more people gradually moved from working the land to living in towns , the word harvest lost its reference to the time of year and came to refer only to the actual activity of reaping , and autumn , as well as fall , began to replace it as a reference to the season .
Question: what is the meaning of the word autumn
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the meaning of the word ""autumn"" based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by talking about the term ""harvest"" being used to refer to the season before the 16th century. It mentions that in West Germanic languages like Dutch herfst German Herbst and Scots Hairst it still refers to the time of year even today. However as people moved from working the land to living in towns the word ""harvest"" lost its seasonal reference and started meaning just the activity of reaping.  Now the context shifts to how this change affected the term ""autumn."" It says that autumn began to replace harvest as a reference to the season. So I think this means that originally both harvest and autumn referred to the same time of year—autumn. But over time with more people moving away from farming the word harvest lost its seasonal meaning and started just meaning the act of reaping. Consequently autumn was reinterpreted as the season itself.  Putting it all together ""autumn"" is now used to refer specifically to the fall season marking the end of summer and beginning of winter. It's the time when leaves change color apples start to spoil etc. So essentially autumn refers to the season rather than just the act of reaping.  Autumn refers to the fall season marked by changing weather leaf colors and the end of summer leading into winter.

Context: The name Boötes was first used by Homer in his Odyssey as a celestial reference point for navigation , described as `` late - setting '' or `` slow to set '' , translated as the `` Plowman '' . Exactly whom Boötes is supposed to represent in Greek mythology is not clear . According to one version , he was a son of Demeter , Philomenus , twin brother of Plutus , a ploughman who drove the oxen in the constellation Ursa Major . This is corroborated by the constellation 's name , which itself means `` ox - driver '' or `` herdsman . '' The ancient Greeks saw the asterism now called the `` Big Dipper '' or `` Plough '' as a cart with oxen . This influenced the name 's etymology , derived from the Greek for `` noisy '' or `` ox - driver '' . Another myth associated with Boötes tells that he invented the plow and was memorialized for his ingenuity as a constellation .
Question: how did the constellation bootes get its name
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out how the constellation Boötes got its name. Let me start by recalling what I know from the context provided.  First the name Boötes was first used by Homer in his Odyssey. Homer described it as ""late setting"" or ""slow to set "" which translates to the Plowman. Now according to the myth Boötes is supposed to represent someone. The constellation's name refers to an ox driver or herdsman because of Ursa Major being called the Big Dipper or Plough.  The user also mentioned that another myth associated with Boötes involves him inventing the plow and being memorialized for his ingenuity as a constellation.  Putting this together it seems like the name comes from the ancient Greeks' perception of the constellation. They saw Ursa Major as a cart with oxen hence referring to it as Plough or Ox Driver. This is why the constellation's name relates to ox drivers.  The constellation Boötes got its name from the Greek term for ""ox driver"" or ""herdsman "" reflecting the ancient view of the constellation Ursa Major as a plow with oxen pulling the yoke.", constellation boötes got its name from greek term for ox driver or herdsman reflecting ancient view of constellation ursa major as plow with oxen pulling yoke,"from the Greek Βοώτης, Boōtēs, meaning ""herdsman"" or ""plowman""",0,0.23529411764705882,2.189616300005582,0.0007456549282746797,0.0002189396400998482,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who plays the dad in pretty in pink
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who plays the dad in ""Pretty in Pink."" Let me start by recalling what the movie is about. ""Pretty in Pink"" is a animated film that's based on Roald Dahl's book right? It's set in a boys' school and features several main characters: Pretty the popular girl; Pink the outcast; and their dads who are both teachers.  Wait but I'm not sure if the parents actually appear in the movie. I remember it being more focused on the kids and their interactions rather than showing their families getting involved. So maybe the dads don't have significant roles beyond being present at school events or maybe they're minor characters.  If that's the case perhaps the dads aren't portrayed by any actors because they're not central to the plot. Or maybe there are some cameos where the parents interact with Pretty and Pink in minor ways. I think I've heard that sometimes the directors include parents as a way to build relationships between the kids or show support without overcomplicating the story.  I also recall that the movie is directed by Andrew Stanton who's known for other animated films like ""The Iron Giant."" Maybe he included the dads in some scenes where Pretty and Pink are having a hard time fitting in showing how their dads help them through.  So putting it all together I'm pretty sure that while the parents exist as characters they aren't given substantial roles or portrayed by famous actors. Instead their presence is more subtle perhaps just to add background support without overshadowing the main story.  The ""dads"" in ""Pretty in Pink"" are not portrayed by any prominent actors because they serve minor roles primarily as supportive figures at school events rather than central characters.

At neutral pH , the dye absorbs red light most strongly and transmits blue light . Solutions of the dye , therefore , are blue . At low pH , the dye absorbs ultraviolet and blue light most strongly and appears yellow in solution . In solution at pH 3.6 ( in the middle of the transition range of this pH indicator ) obtained by dissolution in water without any pH adjustment , bromophenol blue has a characteristic green red color , where the apparent color shifts depending on the concentration and / or path length through which the solution is observed . This phenomenon is called dichromatic color . Bromophenol blue is the substance with the highest known value of Kreft 's dichromaticity index . This means it has the largest change in color hue , when the thickness or concentration of observed sample increases or decreases .
Question: what is the purpose of the bromophenol blue dye in the samples
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the purpose of bromophenol blue dye in the samples. From the context provided I remember that bromophenol blue is used as a dye. It has different colors based on the pH of the solution.  At neutral pH (which is around pH 7) it absorbs red light strongly and lets through blue light so the solution appears blue. That makes sense because dyes work by absorbing certain wavelengths and transmitting others which we see as their color.  But when the pH is low specifically at pH 3.6 in this case it changes its absorbance properties. At lower pH (more acidic) it absorbs UV light and blue light more making the solution appear yellow. So I guess bromophenol blue acts as an indicator because of these pH-dependent color changes.  Wait but the question is about the purpose. The context mentions that at neutral pH the dye appears blue because of how it interacts with red light. But when dissolved without adjusting pH (so presumably at a lower pH) it's yellow due to absorbing other wavelengths.  The key here is that bromophenol blue changes color based on pH. This must be used as an indicator to measure or determine the pH level in samples. It's indicating the acidity or basicity by its color change which makes sense because indicators like phenolphthalein also change color with pH.  So putting it all together the purpose of bromophenol blue is probably to indicate the pH of a solution. When dissolved without adjustment (i.e. at lower pH) it appears yellow instead of blue allowing us to determine if the solution is acidic or neutral.  The purpose of bromophenol blue dye in samples is to indicate the pH level by its color change. At low pH it turns yellow helping to determine acidity or basicity.   Answer: The bromophenol blue dye is used to indicate the pH of a solution by changing its color from blue at neutral pH to yellow when dissolved at lower pH., bromophenol blue dye is used to indicate ph of solution by changing its color from blue at neutral ph to yellow when dissolved at lower ph,a pH indicator,0,0.07142857142857144,3.416552099995897,0.0011868309150138657,0.00034847799369306856,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who plays zoey in i love you man
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who plays Zoey in the movie ""I Love You Man."" Let me start by recalling what I know about this movie. It's a comedy starring Teddy Shapiro and Zooey Deschanel. Wait but wait— isn't there another character named Zoey? Oh right Teddy is Peter in ""Peter and Zooey "" so maybe Zooey Deschanel also plays someone else in ""I Love You Man.""  Let me think about the movie's plot. I remember that it's about a guy who moves into an apartment with three roommates: Peter who's straight; and two other roommates Adam and Ben who are both gay. The central character is Peter who has a crush on Zoey Deschanel's character but wait isn't she played by someone else?  Wait no actually in ""I Love You Man "" Zoey plays the opposite role of her character in ""Peter and Zooey."" In ""Peter and Zooey "" she's the straight one but here she's paired with Adam as a gay couple. So who is playing Zoey in ""I Love You Man""? From what I remember it's someone else.  Wait no actually let me get this right. The question is asking specifically for the person playing Zooey in ""I Love You Man."" In that movie the opposite of her character from ""Peter and Zooey"" would be played by someone else. I think it's either someone like Benji5 or maybe another actor.  Wait actually in ""I Love You Man "" the three roommates are Adam (played by Benji5) Peter (Teddy Shapiro) and Ben (played by someone else). So the character who was straight before would now be paired with Adam. Therefore it's probably played by someone like Patrick Lawler or maybe another actor.  Wait but I think the answer is Patrick Lawler. Let me confirm: In ""I Love You Man "" Zoey Deschanel plays a gay woman named Emilio opposite Benji5 (Adam). So the person playing her in this movie would be Patrick Lawler as Peter but wait no—Teddy Shapiro is Peter again.  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me think again: ""I Love You Man"" has Teddy Shapiro as Peter and Adam is played by Benji5 so the third roommate is Ben who was originally straight in ""Peter and Zooey."" So in this movie Ben's character falls for Emilio (played by Patrick Lawler) which is the opposite of her previous role.

Context: In 1716 , the Spanish government established several Roman Catholic missions in East Texas . The isolation of the missions -- the nearest Spanish settlement , San Juan Bautista , Coahuila was over 400 miles ( 644 km ) away -- made it difficult to keep them adequately provisioned . To assist the missionaries , the new governor of Spanish Texas , Martín de Alarcón , wished to establish a way station between the settlements along the Rio Grande and the new missions in East Texas . In April 1718 , Alarcón led an expedition to found a new community in Texas . On May 1 , the group erected a temporary mud , brush , and straw structure near the headwaters of the San Antonio River . This building would serve as a new mission , San Antonio de Valero , named after Saint Anthony of Padua and the viceroy of New Spain , Baltasar de Zúñiga y Guzmán Sotomayor y Sarmiento , Marquess of Valero . The mission , headed by Father Antonio de San Buenaventura y Olivares , was located near a community of Coahuiltecans and was initially populated by three to five Indian converts from Mission San Francisco Solano near San Juan Bautista . One mile ( two km ) north of the mission , Alarcón built a presidio ( fort ) , the Presidio San Antonio de Bexar . Close by , he founded the first civilian community in Texas , San Antonio de Bexar ( now San Antonio , Texas ) .
Question: when was the mission san antonio de valero built
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out when the mission San Antonio de Valero was built based on the context provided. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context starts by talking about the establishment of several missions in East Texas by the Spanish government between 1716 and later years. It mentions specific events like Martín de Alarcón leading an expedition to found a new community in April 1718 which becomes San Antonio de Bexar. However I'm looking for when San Antonio de Valero was built.  Looking further down after discussing the way station near the headwaters of the San Antonio River and the establishment of the mission San Antonio de Valero named after Saint Anthony of Padua and Baltasar de Zúñiga y Guzmán Sotomayor y Sarmiento Marquess of Valero. The context mentions that this building was erected in May 1 but it doesn't specify a date beyond that.  Wait actually I think the context says that the mission was erected near the headwaters of the San Antonio River and was initially populated by converts from Mission San Francisco Solano. However when exactly it was built isn't directly stated. Since the context mentions May 1 but doesn't provide a year for the construction maybe the answer is in the surrounding information.  Wait no I think I need to check again. The context says that on May 1 Alarcón erected a temporary structure which became San Antonio de Valero. But it's unclear when exactly this happened beyond that date. However given the timeline from earlier mentions of 1716 and then in April 1718 with other missions perhaps the building was done around that time.  Wait but actually after discussing the way station and Alarcón leading an expedition to found a new community on May 1 which became San Antonio de Bexar. Then later near the mission named Valero is built in May of what year?  I think I might be mixing up details here. The key point is that the context mentions that on May 1 Alarcón built this structure called San Antonio de Valero but it's not giving a specific date beyond that. However given the surrounding information about April 1718 and other missions established before that I might infer that the building was done around 1718.  Wait no actually in the context provided the exact date when San Antonio de Valero was built isn't specified. It only mentions May 1 as the date for the temporary structure. But perhaps the user is expecting an answer based on typical timelines or other sources. However given the information here I can only conclude that it's mentioned to have been built by May of some year but without a specific date.  Wait no let me re-read: ""On May 1 the group erected a temporary mud brush and straw structure near the headwaters of the San Antonio River. This building would serve as a new mission San Antonio de Valero..."" So the context doesn't specify when it was completed or established beyond that. Therefore perhaps the answer is simply based on the information given which mentions May 1 but doesn't provide a year.  Wait no looking back: ""In April 1718 Alarcón led an expedition to found a new community in Texas."" Then later near the mission Valero built on May 1. So maybe the mission was established around that time perhaps early 1718.  But I'm not sure if that's accurate because the context doesn't specify the year beyond mentioning April 1718 for Alarcón leading an expedition to found San Antonio de Bexar in 1718. Therefore without a specific date provided for San Antonio de Valero perhaps it's safe to say based on the information given that the mission was built around May of some year but since it doesn't provide a year after that point maybe I can only state that it was established near the headwaters in an unspecified month and year.  Wait no actually the context says ""On May 1..."" so it must have been completed by then. Therefore perhaps the answer is simply that the mission was built on May 1 but since the user is asking for a date maybe it's just not provided beyond that point in the given text.  Wait but no looking again: The context says ""On May 1 the group erected..."" so I think the mission was established there perhaps as completed around then. But without a year after May 1 perhaps the answer is simply based on other sources or typical timelines but since we only have this context maybe the answer isn't explicitly provided.  Wait no actually in the context the only dates are April 1718 for Alarcón leading to found San Antonio de Bexar and May 1st for the temporary building. So perhaps the mission was built around that time so I can say it was established between April 1718 and May 1 of some year.  But maybe in reality the answer is that the mission was established on May 1 1718 as per other sources or context beyond what's given. However since only the context provided specifies May 1 but no year perhaps it's safe to say based on the information that the mission was built in April 1718.  Wait I'm getting confused here. The context says Alarcón led an expedition in April 1718 and founded San Antonio de Bexar (now San Antonio). Then near there is San Antonio de Valero. So perhaps both missions were established around that time so maybe May 1st of 1718.  Wait no the context doesn't specify a year beyond mentioning April 1718 for Alarcón leading to found San Antonio de Bexar. It only says on May 1 he erected the temporary structure near the headwaters of the San Antonio River which is now San Antonio de Valero.  So perhaps the answer is that the mission was built on May 1 but without a specific year beyond that point in the context provided. Therefore maybe I can infer that it's established around the same time as Alarcón's expedition in April 1718 so likely May 1 1718.  Alternatively perhaps the answer is simply May 1 of some year but since no specific date beyond that is given maybe the answer isn't provided and I should look for another way. However based on typical historical timelines missions in Texas were established around this period so it's plausible that San Antonio de Valero was built in 1718.  Wait but without explicit information from the context perhaps the best answer is to state that it was established May 1st of a specific year but since only May 1 is mentioned maybe I can conclude that the mission was built on May 1 1718.

The first part talks about an extensive survey done by the Lord Howe Island Board in 1974. That was probably important for conservation but doesn't directly relate to it being a World Heritage Site.  Then there's mention of the Lord Howe Island Amendment Act in 1981. This act made parts of the island a permanent park preserve. But again not the same as UNESCO recognition.  The next part mentions that the island was cited under the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1982. So that must be when it became a World Heritage Site. The management plan and Ranger details are about administration but don't affect the UNESCO status.  So putting it all together Lord Howe Island became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982.  Lord Howe Island was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982.,lord howe island was recognized as unesco world heritage site in 1982,in 1982,0,0.2857142857142857,1.7205851000035182,0.000592106981365063,0.00017385480130954092,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when does the new saw 8 come out
Answer: ","Alright so I'm trying to figure out when the new "" Saw"" movie specifically Saw 8 is coming out. From what I remember reading there was some mention of a ninth installment in the Lionsgate series where the Spierig brothers weren't involved anymore. Wait but the user asked about ""the new saw 8 "" which suggests maybe they're referring to an eighth film rather than the ninth.  Looking back at the context provided: it says that on January 16 2018 Lionsgate started discussing a ninth installment where the Spierig brothers weren't returning. Hmm so maybe ""the new saw"" here refers to Saw 9? Or perhaps there's confusion between numbering in different contexts.  Wait no the user specifically asked about Saw 8. So if the context mentions the ninth installment starting discussions after January 2018 then Saw 8 might have been released before that time. But I don't have information on when exactly Saw 8 was released.   I should check if there's any other info provided. The only date mentioned is the start of talks for the ninth film in 2018 but nothing about Saw 8's release date. Maybe it's still under production or scheduled before that? I don't have enough information to confirm when Saw 8 came out.  So based on what I know I can't provide a specific release date for Saw 8 as the context doesn't cover it.

It proscribes conduct perceived as threatening , harmful , or otherwise endangering to the property , health , safety , and moral welfare of people . Most criminal law is established by statute , which is to say that the laws are enacted by a legislature . It includes the punishment of people who violate these laws . Criminal law varies according to jurisdiction , and differs from civil law , where emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation than on punishment .
Question: what is the main objective of criminal law
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the main objective of criminal law based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that Criminal Law is the body of law related to crime and it proscribes conduct perceived as threatening harmful or endangering property health safety or moral welfare. It's mostly established by statute meaning laws are made by legislature and includes punishment for violating these laws. It also mentions that criminal law varies by jurisdiction and differs from civil law which focuses more on dispute resolution and victim compensation rather than punishment.  So putting this together the main points about criminal law are: 1. It deals with crimes. 2. It prohibits certain harmful behaviors. 3. It involves legal consequences for violating these laws like punishment. 4. It changes depending on where you are legally located (varying jurisdictions). 5. It's different from civil law in its focus; while civil law is about resolving disputes and helping victims criminal law is about punishing offenders.  The question asks for the main objective of criminal law. From this context the key part seems to be that criminal law proscribes or prohibits certain conduct as being harmful or threatening to people’s property health safety or moral welfare. Additionally it includes the punishment aspect since it involves legal consequences when laws are violated.  So combining these ideas the main objective would revolve around preventing such harmful behavior through establishing laws and punishing those who break them. Therefore criminal law's primary goal is to maintain public safety by defining what conduct is unacceptable and holding individuals accountable for violating those definitions.  The main objective of criminal law is to prevent harmful conduct by establishing prohibitions on actions deemed threatening or dangerous to property health safety and moral welfare while also addressing violations through legal punishment., main objective of criminal law is to prevent harmful conduct by establishing prohibitions on actions deemed threatening or dangerous to property health safety and moral welfare while also addressing violations through legal punishment,"proscribes conduct perceived as threatening, harmful, or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety, and moral welfare of people",0,0.4705882352941177,2.999859200004721,0.0010415301149181233,0.0003058146870174328,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: where is hallmark channel home and family filmed
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the Hallmark Channel show ""Home & Family"" was filmed based on the provided context. Let me look at the context again.  The context mentions that Home and Family is a two-hour daily Hallmark series recorded one day prior in Los Angeles California. There's also something about Steines deciding to film there to encourage actors not to wake up at 4 AM. The show focuses on entertainment and tips within a ""wholesome image"" and avoids current events or politics as well as censors certain words like ""breast.""  So the key point here is that Los Angeles California was the filming location because it's mentioned right after stating the show's duration and the reason for choosing that location.

Question: death march to parallel world rhapsody ep 5
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to answer the question about ""Death March to Parallel World Rhapsody Episode 5"" based on the context provided. The context mentions a video titled ""A Trip to the Underworld That Started With a Death March"" from DesusMAchi Kara Haimari (translated as ""DesusMAchi kara hajimaru i yo - kai ryojō"") released on March 29 2018. The question is asking about Episode 5 of the song ""Death March to Parallel World Rhapsody.""  First I need to make sure I understand what each part refers to. DesusMAchi Kara Haimari seems to be a character or perhaps an artist's name. The term ""Death March"" might refer to either the theme of the video or possibly an event within the song's storyline.  The song title is ""Death March to Parallel World Rhapsody."" It sounds like it's part of a series maybe involving a journey through different worlds with each episode having its own content. Episode 5 would then be part of this series likely building on previous episodes.  Since I don't have the full lyrics or detailed context about the song's episodes I can only make an educated guess based on what's provided. The video's release date is March 29 2018 but that might correspond to when Episode 5 was released or perhaps it's related to a specific part of the series.  Given the limited information my best answer would be to state that Episode 5 of ""Death March to Parallel World Rhapsody"" is likely available on platforms where such content is hosted as there's no additional context provided about its availability or features.

332,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: The scriptures of the titled `` Old Testament '' are not accurately complete without the records of those Hebrew writers that penned them . This points to the complete records that declare the clarity of the Grecian conquests of the Judeans during and after the reign of Alexander , as indicated by the book of Maccabbees . The historical accuracy by the prophet Ezra is complete only when the details of the Apocrypha 's 1st and 2nd Esdras are referenced , since there is where the complete history of the dispersion of the Northern Kingdom tribes is seen , in 2 Esdras 13 : 40 -- 48 .
Question: who did the assyrians conquer in 722 bce
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who the Assyrians conquered in 722 BCE based on the given context. Let me start by reading the context carefully.  The context mentions that the Old Testament isn't complete without certain Hebrew writers' records. It talks about the Greek conquests of Judeans during and after Alexander the Great referencing the book of Maccabees. Then it says that Ezra's history is complete when the details from the Apocrypha's 1st and 2nd Esdras are included specifically mentioning the dispersion of the Northern Kingdom tribes in 2 Esdras 13:40–48.  Hmm so it seems like the context isn't directly about the Assyrians' conquests. Instead it's more focused on the Greek conquests and the dispersion under Ezra-Ezra-Ezra with some Apocryphal books. I don't see any mention of the Assyrians or their specific conquests in this passage.  Wait maybe the question is trying to link the book of Maccabees to the Assyrian conquest? Book of Maccabees does talk about events after Alexander the Great which was around 332 BCE. But the question is asking about 722 BCE which is much earlier—way before Alexander's time. So that's probably a red herring.  I think the context doesn't provide information about what the Assyrians conquered in 722 BCE. It's more about the aftermath of Alexander and Ezra-Ezra-Ezra with some apocryphal books. Therefore without direct information from the context about the Assyrians' conquests around that time I can't answer based on it.  I should probably state that the provided context doesn't mention what the Assyrians conquered in 722 BCE.  The provided context does not mention who the Assyrians conquered in 722 BCE., provided context does not mention who assyrians conquered in 722 bce,"the ruling city of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, Samaria",0,0.0,3.2177846999984467,0.00112563081193861,0.0003305083833099206,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who missed the plane the day the music died
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out who missed the plane on the day the music died. From what I remember this is related to Don McLean's song ""American Pie."" He wrote it in 1971 and refers to a tragic event as the day music died. The context mentions that for McLean this event symbolized the loss of innocence among early rock-'n'-roll fans.  Hmm so I think the question is asking about the person who missed the plane on that fateful day. I believe the song's lyrics mention a young girl whose parents miss the plane. Specifically there's a part where it says something like ""My little girl I know you're out there / Missing the plane right now.""   Wait so maybe it's that girl who missed the plane. But I'm not entirely sure if she was an innocent person or just someone affected by the event. The context does tie this to the loss of innocence symbolizing a generation's perspective.  So putting it together Don McLean is the one who wrote about ""the day the music died "" and in his song he refers to a young girl whose parents are missing the plane on that day. Therefore the person who missed the plane would be her parents.

Sometimes a team will give rings to fans as part of a charity raffle . Teams can distribute any number of rings .

The context provided mentions that in 2015 the New England Patriots' rings cost $36 500 each and it's noted as the most expensive Jostens rings ever produced. So from this it seems like the Patriots are the one with the most expensive rings.  I should make sure there isn't any other team mentioned with higher costs. The context doesn't mention other teams having more expensive rings than the Patriots. It only specifically highlights the Patriots in 2015 and mentions that Jostens has produced rings for them which were the most expensive at that time.

Context: The American entry into World War I came in April 1917 , after more than two and a half years of efforts by President Woodrow Wilson to keep the United States out of the war . Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British , American public opinion reflected that of the president : the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans , German Americans and Scandinavian Americans , as well as among church leaders and among women in general . On the other hand , even before World War I had broken out , American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe . Over time , especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915 , the American citizens increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe .

Question: 5 cities with the highest population in europe
Answer: ",Okay I need to find out which five European cities have the highest populations. First I'll look through the provided data.  I see a list of cities along with their population numbers. Let me scan down and pick out the top five based on the population values given.  1. The first city listed is Rome with 7005942000000000000 which translates to 7 005 942 000 people. 2. Next Kiev has a population of 7006380000000000000 approximately 7 006 380 000. 3. Belfast has 1 166 763 which is much smaller so I'll note that it's lower. 4. Odessa with 999 359 seems to be a significant city but also smaller compared to the first two. 5. New York City appears later in the list with 1 007 119 which is even smaller.  Looking through the rest of the data cities like London and Paris aren't mentioned here so I can’t rely solely on this list for accuracy. However based on what's provided Kiev seems to have the highest population followed by Rome.  Based on the provided data the five cities with the highest populations in Europe are:  1. **Rome** - Population: 7 005 942 000 2. **Kiev** - Population: 7 006 380 000 3. **Belfast** - Population: 1 166 763 (Note: This population is significantly lower than the first two) 4. **Odessa** - Population: 999 359 5. **New York City** - Population: 1 007 119  However it's important to note that this list does not include major European cities like London or Paris which are known for their large populations but are not listed in the provided data.  Final Answer: The five cities with the highest populations in Europe based on the given data are **Rome** **Kiev** **Belfast** **Odessa** and **New York City**., five cities with highest populations in europe based on given data are rome kiev belfast odessa and new york city,Istanbul,0,0.0,4.905367100000149,0.0017368342887145525,0.0005099703088720974,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what rights do eu citizens have under the privacy shield
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out what the answer should be for the question about EU citizens' rights under the Privacy Shield. The context provided mentions that the Privacy Shield has been challenged legally by privacy groups and that as of November 2016 it's unclear whether the cases will be considered admissible.  I remember from my studies that the Privacy Shield is a framework intended to facilitate data transfers between the EU and other countries. It was established under the 1995 ECQ Regulation. The main purpose seems to be protecting personal data within the EU but there have been issues with non-compliance by countries like the US.  The challenge here is that it's unclear if these cases will be admissible now. I think this means that courts might not be able to hear or decide on these Privacy Shield cases anymore because of legal challenges. If the cases are not admissible that would mean that the rules set by the Privacy Shield won't have the same legal standing as other EU directives.  So if someone from a country that's part of the Privacy Shield (like the US) is handling data about EU citizens their rights under the Privacy Shield might be affected. But wait I'm not entirely sure how exactly their rights would be impacted without more specifics.  I think the answer should mention something about the legal status being unclear because of these challenges. Maybe it also talks about implications for data privacy regarding EU citizens when using the Privacy Shield. Perhaps it's about the uncertainty in applying the Privacy Shield now making it risky to rely on it for protecting personal information.  But I'm not 100% certain if there are specific rights mentioned or just a general statement about their status. The initial answer provided was ""It is unclear whether the cases will be considered admissible."" Maybe that's sufficient but perhaps more detail would be needed regarding actual rights.  Wait maybe the question is asking for what rights EU citizens have under the Privacy Shield so it's not just about the legal aspect of cases being admissible. The answer should probably address what rights are protected or at risk when using the Privacy Shield if the cases aren't admissible.  I'm a bit confused now because I thought the main issue is that the cases might be dismissed making the Privacy Shield less enforceable. So EU citizens' data might not be as protected under the Privacy Shield anymore compared to other EU regulations like GDPR. But since the question specifically asks about rights under the Privacy Shield and given the context provided maybe the answer should just state that it's unclear whether these cases will be admissible which affects how the rights are protected.  I think I need to stick with the information given in the context. The key point is that as of November 2016 the legal challenges mean the cases might not be admissible anymore. So EU citizens' rights under the Privacy Shield could be compromised because these cases won't have the same weight.  As of November 2016 due to legal challenges from privacy groups it is unclear whether Privacy Shield cases will be considered admissible. This uncertainty means that the protections for EU citizens under the Privacy Shield may be compromised potentially affecting their data privacy when using the framework. The admissibility issues suggest that the Privacy Shield's enforceability might be reduced compared to other EU regulations like GDPR.",as of november 2016 due to legal challenges from privacy groups it is unclear whether privacy shield cases will be considered admissible this uncertainty means that protections for eu citizens under privacy shield may be compromised potentially affecting their data privacy when using framework admissibility issues suggest that privacy shields enforceability might be reduced compared to other eu regulations like gdpr,the benefits of the US Privacy Act,0,0.060606060606060615,5.319431700001587,0.0018761622998545236,0.0005508798817296053,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: The Battle of Badr ( Arabic : غزوة بدر ‎ ‎ ) , fought on Tuesday , 13 March 624 CE ( 17 Ramadan , 2 AH in the Islamic calendar ) in the Hejaz region of western Arabia ( present - day Saudi Arabia ) , was a key battle in the early days of Islam and a turning point in Muhammad 's struggle with his opponents among the Quraish in Mecca . The battle has been passed down in Islamic history as a decisive victory attributable to divine intervention , or by secular sources to the strategic genius of Muhammad . It is one of the few battles specifically mentioned in the Quran . All knowledge of the battle at Badr comes from traditional Islamic accounts , both hadiths and biographies of Muhammad , recorded in written form some time after the battle . There is little evidence outside of these of the battle . There are no descriptions of the battle prior to the 9th Century .
Question: when did the battle of badr take place
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the Battle of Badr took place. The context provided mentions that it happened on Tuesday 13 March 624 CE which is also referred to as 17 Ramadan in the 2nd year of the Islamic calendar (2 AH).   I remember that the Islamic calendar is lunar and starts with the Hijra from Mecca to Medina. Each year has about 12 months but can have 354 or 355 days depending on whether a leap month is added. So converting a Gregorian date to an Islamic year might involve some calculation.  Looking at the context again it says the battle was fought on Tuesday 13 March 624 CE which translates to 17 Ramadan in 2 AH. Therefore I can directly extract that the battle occurred in the year 624 AD or equivalently 2 AH.   I don't think there's any additional information needed beyond what's provided because the context clearly states both dates and the Islamic equivalent of the Gregorian year.  The Battle of Badr took place on Tuesday March 13 624 CE which corresponds to the Islamic year 2 AH., battle of badr took place on tuesday march 13 624 ce which corresponds to islamic year 2 ah,"Tuesday, 13 March 624 CE (17 Ramadan, 2 AH in the Islamic calendar)",0,0.5333333333333333,2.1708657999988645,0.0007508332841734788,0.00022046011201494077,0.0,0.0,0.0
340,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: With OBD II standards , vehicle manufacturers were required to test the exhaust gas recirculation ( EGR ) valve for functionality during driving . Some manufacturers use the MaP sensor to accomplish this . In these vehicles , they have a MAF sensor for their primary load sensor . The MaP sensor is then used for rationality checks and to test the EGR valve . The way they do this is during a deceleration of the vehicle when there is low absolute pressure in the intake manifold ( i.e. , a high vacuum present in the intake manifold relative to the outside air ) the powertrain control module ( PCM ) will open the EGR valve and then monitor the MaP sensor 's values . If the EGR is functioning properly , the manifold absolute pressure will increase as exhaust gases enter .
Question: where is the manifold absolute pressure sensor located
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor is located based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that in vehicles with OBD II standards and MaP sensors the MAP sensor is used for testing the EGR valve. It specifically says that during a deceleration when there's low absolute pressure in the intake manifold (which means high vacuum) the PCM opens the EGR valve and monitors the MAP sensor values.  So from this I gather that the MAP sensor isn't located directly on the engine or the exhaust system; instead it's part of the intake manifold. The intake manifold is a component that sends air to the cylinders for combustion. Therefore the MAP sensor must be installed in the intake manifold itself.  I don't think it's inside the cylinder because that would require a different kind of sensor and isn't mentioned here. It can't be in the transmission or other parts as per the context provided. So the only logical place is within the intake manifold.  The MAP sensor is located on the intake manifold., map sensor is located on intake manifold,internal combustion engine's electronic control system,0,0.0,2.044329000011203,0.0006925305950848787,0.00020334124203650854,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who is the supreme justice of the supreme court
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out who the Supreme Justices of the Supreme Court are based on the provided context. The question specifically asks for the ""supreme justice"" which likely refers to all nine justices.  Looking at the context it mentions that John Roberts is the incumbent Chief Justice since September 29 2005. It also lists his title as ""Honorable "" and provides informal titles like ""Mr."" and ""Your Honor"" depending on the address. Additionally in the Formation section of the context it notes that John Jay was the first Chief Justice from September 26 1789.  So while John Roberts is the current Chief Justice I know there are eight other justices who serve alongside him as Supreme Justices. The context doesn't list all their names beyond mentioning John Jay's role and that they have different titles based on how they're addressed.  Therefore to answer the question accurately I should state that the Supreme Court has nine justices: one Chief Justice (John Roberts) and eight Associate Justices with varying official titles.  The Supreme Court consists of nine justices including the incumbent Chief Justice John Roberts. The other eight are referred to by their official titles depending on how they're addressed.

Question: the fellowship of the ring director's cut length
Answer: ",Alright so I'm trying to figure out how long The Fellowship of the Ring is. I know it's a part of Lord of the Rings directed by Peter Jackson. From what I remember Peter Jackson made some really long movies before he got famous again with The Hobbit.  I think it was around 2001 when they released the director's cut. But how many hours is that? I'm not exactly sure but I've heard something about it being over 16 hours long. Wait is that right? It seems quite lengthy for a typical movie so maybe it's around 18-20 hours.  Let me think if there are any other details to consider. The director's cut usually includes extra scenes and deleted scenes from the regular release which would add more time. I don't recall the exact number but considering the length of the original theatrical release adding about an hour or two for the cuts makes sense.  So putting it all together I think the Director's Cut is approximately 18 to 20 hours long. That seems plausible because some special editions can be that long.

Question: who has the highest corporate taxes in the world
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which country or region has the highest corporate tax rate based on the information provided. Let me start by going through each entry and noting down the tax rates where applicable.  First looking at some of the higher tax rates:  - **United States Virgin Islands**: 50% federal income tax. - **Zimbabwe**: N/A but in the original text it's mentioned with N/A so maybe no data or not applicable. - **Sudan**: N/A.  - **Swaziland (Eswatini)**: 27.5%. That's quite high. - **Luxembourg** isn't listed here but sometimes it's known for having very high taxes up to 40% for corporations. But in the given data no entry for Luxembourg.   Wait looking back the user provided a lot of countries and regions with their tax rates including:  - **United Kingdom**: The effective rate is around 20% (standard) but it's mentioned as 7001190000000000000 ♠ 19 % 20 %... Hmm not sure if that's the exact number.   Wait actually in the provided text under United Kingdom it says ""19 % Standard Rate ; ..."". So maybe around 19%.  Looking at some other high rates:  - **Slovenia**: N/A but looking through the data **Sweden** has a tax rate of 25% federal and 60.15% on national level? Wait no under Sweden: 22% or 12% or 6% depending on circumstances.  Wait let me parse this correctly:  - **United States Virgin Islands**: 50% federal income tax. - **Swaziland (Eswatini)**: 27.5% corporate tax. - **Luxembourg** is known to have one of the highest corporate taxes in the world around 40% but it's not listed here.  Looking through other entries:  - **Sri Lanka**: Corporate tax rates are mentioned as 15% or up for high earners so not extremely high. - **Slovakia**: N/A perhaps. - **Switzerland**: Has a corporate tax rate of around 17.92% which is high but lower than some others.  Wait looking again:  Under **United States Virgin Islands** it's 50% federal income tax. That seems very high compared to other regions listed here.  Also under **Sudan** N/A but perhaps the tax isn't applicable or not provided.  So putting this together the highest corporate tax rate mentioned is in the United States Virgin Islands at 50%. Then Swaziland at 27.5% and perhaps some others like Switzerland around 18%.  Wait let me check each entry again carefully:  - **United States Virgin Islands**: 50% federal income tax. - **Swaziland (Eswatini)**: 27.5% corporate tax. - **Luxembourg** is known to have a high rate but isn't listed here.  Since the question includes information about the United States Virgin Islands which has a 50% federal income tax that's probably the highest among those listed.   So the answer would be the United States Virgin Islands with a 50% corporate tax rate.  The United States Virgin Islands has the highest corporate tax rate mentioned in the provided data at 50%.", united states virgin islands has highest corporate tax rate mentioned in provided data at 50,Zambia,0,0.0,6.833866999993916,0.002430426204017442,0.0007136231763773728,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who won la liga in the last 10 years
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who won La Liga in the last 10 years based on the provided context. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The user wants to know which team has been the champion of La Liga within the past decade.  First I'll look through the data given. The context spans from 1929 up until 2017 or so with each entry listing the season winner and runner-up among other details like top scorers and their clubs. Each row represents a season starting from 1929 as the first season listed.  Since the user is asking about the last 10 years I need to figure out what range that falls into. Typically ""last 10 years"" would mean from 2013 to 2023 but since the data goes up only to 2017 or so (looking at line 16: Real Madrid won in 2017) I'll consider the last decade within that dataset.  Looking through each season:  - Line 16 is from 2015: Barcelona won. - Then 2016: Barcelona again. - 2017: Real Madrid won.  So from 2013 to 2017 (since data ends in 2017) the winners were:  2013: Real Madrid 2014: Atlético Madrid 2015: Barcelona 2016: Barcelona 2017: Real Madrid  Wait but the user specified ""last 10 years "" which would be from 2013 to 2022. However since the data only goes up to 2017 we can't consider beyond that. So within the provided context the last decade (up to 2017) had Barcelona as champions in three seasons: 2015 2016 and 2017.  Therefore the most recent champion is Real Madrid for 2013-2014 followed by Barcelona's three consecutive titles from 2015 to 2017. But since the question asks who won in the last 10 years and the data only goes up to 2017 I can confidently say that Barcelona won three times Real Madrid once and then maybe consider if there's any other champion beyond 2017 but given the context ends at 2017 it's limited.  So putting it all together within the last decade as per the data Barcelona was the champion in 2015 2016 and 2017. Real Madrid was the champion in 2013 and 2014.  The last 10 years (up to 2017) within the provided context show that:  - **Barcelona** won La Liga three times: in 2015 2016 and 2017. - **Real Madrid** won twice before that: in 2013 and 2014.  Thus Barcelona was the most recent champion within this timeframe.",thus barcelona was most recent champion within this timeframe,Real Madrid,0,0.0,6.147250699999859,0.002171647488459651,0.0006376404171930161,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who sings my anaconda don't want none
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who sang ""My Anaconda Don't Want None."" The question is based on a context that mentions an episode from Apple Music's Carpool Karaoke featuring Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner. They used Sean Bean's Yorkshire accent in the parody of this song.  First I'll recall what Carpool Karaoke does—it typically pairs celebrities with songs to cover them in duets. The specific episode mentioned is likely about Game of Thrones since it features Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner who are both known actors from that show.  Sean Bean has a distinctive Yorkshire accent so he's probably the one providing the parody voice. The song ""My Anaconda Don't Want None"" must be the target here because they're parodying its beginning with his accent.   I should make sure there isn't another singer involved or if this is a lesser-known song that might have been covered by someone else but given the context and the mention of Sean Bean's accent it seems pretty clear.  Sean Bean sang ""My Anaconda Don't Want None"" in the parody featured during Apple Music's Carpool Karaoke episode starring Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner.",sean bean sang my anaconda dont want none in parody featured during apple musics carpool karaoke episode starring maisie williams and sophie turner,Sir Mix-a-Lot,0,0.0,2.0552146999980323,0.0007059769048729197,0.0002072893554520217,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what is the population of keystone heights florida
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the population of Keystone Heights Florida. Let me start by looking through the context provided.   The context says that Keystone Heights is located in southwestern Clay County Florida and as of the 2010 census its population was 1 350. Hmm wait a second—Keystone Heights Florida isn't explicitly mentioned here; instead it's just referred to as a city within Clay County. So I'm assuming that the city name given in the context is Keystone Heights.  Since the question asks for the population of Keystone Heights Florida and the context provides the 2010 census data as 1 350 people I can conclude that's the answer they're looking for. There's no mention of any other years or different populations beyond 2010 so it's safe to use that figure.

Context: Coverage of the 2016 Murder of Ashley Ann Olsen , an American murdered in Italy during a sexual encounter with a Senegalese immigrant , focused on the victim blaming in cross-cultural encounters .
Question: the victim was asking for it is an example of a
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out what ""the victim was asking for it"" means in this context about Ashley Ann Olsen's murder. The question is whether this is an example of something related to cross-cultural encounters and victim blaming.  First let me break down the context given. It says that the 2016 murder involved a sexual encounter between an American woman (Ashley Ann Olsen) and a Senegalese immigrant in Italy. The coverage focused on the victim blaming aspect during cross-cultural interactions.  So ""the victim was asking for it"" probably refers to the situation where the victim initiated the sexual encounter. In many cultures especially Western ones initiating a sexual encounter might be considered polite or even normal in certain contexts. However in other cultures like Senegal this might not be the norm.   Victim blaming typically occurs when the victim of an intimate partner violence incident is held accountable by the perpetrator's family or society. It's a response to address the imbalance of power and responsibility within the relationship.  In this case if the victim was initiating the sexual encounter without intending to cause harm but the other party (the attacker) did blame the victim for the crime that could be an example of victim blaming in cross-cultural contexts where cultural norms about initiating sex might differ.   I'm not sure exactly what term fits here but considering the focus on cross-cultural encounters and victim blaming it's likely referring to something like ""victim-blaming behavior"" or specifically ""cross-cultural victim blaming."" Since the user is prompting for a concise answer without excessive reasoning I think the best way is to mention both the victim blaming and the cultural aspect as part of the same phenomenon.  The statement ""the victim was asking for it"" refers to an instance of **victim-blaming behavior** in a cross-cultural context. This occurs when the victim initiates a sexual encounter that later leads to violence with the perpetrator's culture attributing the crime to the victim's actions despite societal norms elsewhere not encouraging such initiation.", statement victim was asking for it refers to instance of victimblaming behavior in crosscultural context this occurs when victim initiates sexual encounter that later leads to violence with perpetrators culture attributing crime to victims actions despite societal norms elsewhere not encouraging such initiation,Victim blaming,0,0.04444444444444444,3.2873888000031,0.0011478735657061874,0.0003370393137980633,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when was the last time the dodgers went to the world seris
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the Dodgers last went to the World Series based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that the Tigers averaged a 7.56 rating and 138 000 viewers during the 2016 season. It talks about Mario Impemba doing play-by-play with Rod Allen or Kirk Gibson as color commentator. But I don't see any mention of the Dodgers at all in this context.  Wait maybe the question is mixing up the Los Angeles Dodgers with another team. The Tigers are from Detroit so they're a different team altogether. The context doesn't provide information about the Dodgers' World Series appearances.  I think there's no way to answer this based on the given context because it only refers to the Tigers and doesn't mention the Dodgers at all.

First I know that the 2000 Summer Olympics were held in Sydney Australia from July 17 to August 8 2000. They were a significant event because it was the first time that the United States sent an all-female gymnastics team and there was a lot of focus on various top athletes.  Now the question is specifically about the super heavyweight category in boxing. I remember that super heavyweight is a high weight class in boxing often considered the highest level before the heavyweight division. The weight classes are usually set by the International Boxing Association (IBF) so I should check what was the exact weight for super heavyweight at the time.  I also recall that in 2000 the IBF had a system with different weight divisions: light middle heavy super heavy and then the heavyweight. The super heavyweight division would have been around 315 pounds or heavier if I'm not mistaken. Now who were some of the notable boxers fighting in that category at the time?  I think about the top names from that era. There was Mike Tyson who had already made a name for himself with his intense matches and knockout power. Then there was Sugar Ray Leonard who was known as ""The Big Easy"" because he used to reside in New Orleans but became quite famous during the Olympics.  Wait did either of them win their gold medals at the 2000 Olympics? I remember Mike Tyson winning a gold medal in another event maybe in swimming or something else. But no he was primarily known as a boxer by then.  Now focusing on boxing matches: there were multiple rounds and different matches in various categories. The super heavyweight final would have been one of the main events. So who were the participants?  I think one of them was Wladimir Klitschko who is now famous for his brother Vitaly both being boxers with significant achievements. But I'm not sure if they fought each other in 2000 or later.  Another name that comes to mind is Sugar magnate Sugar Ray Leonard. He had a strong reputation as an opponent for Mike Tyson. So maybe Leonard and Tyson were set to face off against each other but I think their match was before the Olympics perhaps at a previous event like a fight card or a special show.  Wait no I remember that the big names in boxing around 2000 included Klitschko brothers Joe Berdoll and perhaps others. But specifically for super heavyweight gold medal it might have been someone else.  Alternatively I think that among the top contenders were Klitschko (perhaps his brother Vitaly) but I'm not certain if they fought each other in 2000 or another year.  Wait maybe the winner was Joe Berdoll. I recall that he had a long career and was quite successful around that time. Alternatively perhaps it's someone else entirely.  I think I need to cross-reference this information with some known facts. From what I remember Joe Berdoll did win gold medals in other events at the 2000 Olympics like freestyle wrestling or something similar. But for boxing maybe he didn't win a gold medal that year.  On the other hand Sugar Ray Leonard was more active before 2000 and had his peak during the early 90s. So perhaps he wasn't fighting in 2000.  Wait Mike Tyson's name comes up often. Did he fight in the super heavyweight category at the Olympics? I think he might have been fighting in another division because he was more known for middleweight or light heavyweight by then.  So putting this together maybe the winner of the super heavyweight gold medal at the 2000 Olympics was Joe Berdoll. Alternatively perhaps it's someone else like Vitaly Klitschko or Wladimir Klitschko but I'm not certain about their participation in that year.  Wait another thought: I believe that Vitaly Klitschko won a gold medal in another category around 2000 maybe freestyle boxing. But the super heavyweight was his brother's division. So if Wladimir and Vitaly were both boxers perhaps they didn't fight each other at this event.  Alternatively maybe it's not either of them but someone else entirely.  I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to approach this differently. I'll think about the names associated with super heavyweight around 2000 and see if any are prominent in that year's Olympics.  - Mike Tyson: Did he fight in another division? Possibly middleweight or light heavyweight. - Sugar Ray Leonard: Known for his boxing career but perhaps not fighting in 2000 as much. - Joe Berdoll: A notable boxer but I think he might have won medals in other categories like freestyle. - Wladimir Klitschko: His younger brother Vitaly is more famous now. But I'm unsure if they were fighting each other that year.  Wait perhaps the winner was Vitaly Klitschko? No because I think he represented Ukraine and his brother Wladimir might have been fighting someone else in the super heavyweight category at another event.  Alternatively maybe it's not a Klitschko. Perhaps it's another boxer like Yurii Volkov or someone else from the Soviet Union that was prominent then.  But given all this uncertainty I think the answer is Joe Berdoll won the gold medal for freestyle wrestling but in boxing perhaps the winner was Wladimir Klitschko? Wait no he might have been fighting Vitaly. Alternatively maybe it's someone else entirely.  Wait now I'm second-guessing myself because my knowledge is a bit fuzzy on this. Let me try to recall any specific events or matches from 2000 in super heavyweight.  I think that during the 2000 Olympics there was a notable match between Klitschko brothers and perhaps others like Joe Berdoll but I'm not certain about their participation.  Alternatively maybe the winner wasn't a Klitschko. Perhaps it's someone else from the Soviet Union who dominated the weight class that year.  Wait after some research in my mind I remember that Vitaly Klitschko won the gold medal in freestyle boxing at the 2005 World Championships but not necessarily at the Olympics. So perhaps he was fighting elsewhere around 2000.  Alternatively maybe it's not a prominent name like Klitschko or Berdoll. Perhaps it's someone else who had a successful career post-2000.  Wait another angle: The super heavyweight division in 2000 had to be a specific weight class. I think the IBF had different categories then. Maybe the winner was someone with that expertise.  But honestly without looking up the exact results it's hard to say for sure. However based on what I remember Joe Berdoll did win a gold medal in freestyle wrestling at the 2000 Olympics but in boxing perhaps Vitaly Klitschko or another boxer from the Soviet Union was the winner.  Wait no I'm getting more confused now. Let me try to piece it together: If Joe Berdoll didn't win super heavyweight then maybe it's someone else like Wladimir Klitschko? But he might have been fighting Vitaly that year.  Alternatively perhaps it's a different boxer altogether who was the dominant force in super heavyweight around 2000. Maybe someone like Yaroslav Shapokalov or another Ukrainian fighter?  Wait considering all this confusion I think the most likely answer is that Joe Berdoll won his gold medal but not necessarily in super heavyweight. So perhaps the winner of super heavyweight was Wladimir Klitschko but he might have been fighting Vitaly elsewhere.  Alternatively maybe it's someone else like Vitali Tarasov or another fighter from the Soviet Union who dominated the category that year.  Wait no now I'm really not sure. I think I need to recall specific matches or events where prominent boxers fought in super heavyweight around 2000.  Another thought: The 2000 Olympics had several notable boxing matches perhaps involving Klitschko brothers against others like Joe Berdoll and Sugar Ray Leonard. But again not sure about the specifics.  In conclusion after considering all these possibilities and trying to piece together the most probable answer I think that Vitaly Klitschko won the gold medal for freestyle boxing at the 2000 Olympics but in super heavyweight perhaps it was someone else or the same as another match.  The winner of the super heavyweight gold medal at the 2000 Olympics was Vitaly Klitschko. He won a bronze medal in freestyle boxing and faced his brother Wladimir Klitschko in a fight during the event but it wasn't their final match.", winner of super heavyweight gold medal at 2000 olympics was vitaly klitschko he won bronze medal in freestyle boxing and faced his brother wladimir klitschko in fight during event but it wasnt their final match,Audley Harrison,0,0.0,14.891214500006754,0.005283039603066531,0.0015512092061202682,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: A driver 's license is issued by each state 's DMV , which is required to drive . Each state 's DMV also issues a nearly - identical `` non-driver identification card '' to identify persons who are unable or do not want to drive , which is typically treated like a driver 's license for all purposes , except for proving that a person has the right to drive .
Question: where can i get a state issued id
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where to get a state-issued ID based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that each state's DMV issues a driver's license and also an almost identical non-driver identification card for people who can't or don't want to drive. It says this second card is treated like a driver's license except for proving someone has the right to drive.  Hmm so both are issued by the state's DMV and serve similar purposes but with one excluding the driving privilege part. The question is asking where to get a state-issued ID.   Wait actually in the context provided it specifically talks about two types: driver's license and non-driver ID card. But when someone asks for a ""state issued ID "" they might be referring to either of these. However since the DMV issues both but perhaps the main one is the driver's license.   But according to the context each state has its own DMV that issues driver's licenses and similar non-driver cards. So the answer would likely involve going to a state's DMV or an DPS (DEPARTMENT OF Promptness Services) office.  Wait looking again the initial sentence says ""a driver's license is issued by each state's DMV "" so for a standard ID you'd go to your state's DMV. But if someone can't get a driver's license then they might use this non-driver card instead.  So putting it together where can one get a state-issued ID? It would be from their state's DMV or DPS office.

Question: where does cerebrospinal fluid flow to when it exits the cerebral aqueduct
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where cerebrospinal fluid flows after exiting the cerebral aqueduct. I remember that the brain has several openings and structures through which CSF can pass. Let me think about the context provided.  The context mentions a few key points. It talks about interventricular foramina like Monro's which are near the third ventricle. Then it mentions Sylvius's foramen which is related to the cerebral aqueduct—the fourth ventricle area. The third ventricle has Magendie's aperture as well.  The cisterna magna and Luschka's apertures are also mentioned both involving subarachnoid spaces on the right and left sides of the fourth ventricle.   Wait so the cerebral aqueduct is Sylvius's foramen which connects between the third and fourth ventricles. So when CSF exits here it must flow towards somewhere else in the brain. From what I recall after leaving Sylvius's foramen CSF goes into the cisterna magna which then drains into different subarachnoid spaces.  But let me double-check. The cisterna magna is one of the subarachnoid spaces located on each side of the fourth ventricle. So when CSF exits the aqueduct via Sylvius's foramen it goes directly into the cisterna magna. Then from there it can flow through either the right or left lateral apertures (Luschka's) as well.  So putting that together exiting the cerebral aqueduct which is Sylvius's opening CSF flows into the cisterna magna subarachnoid space.  Cerebrospinal fluid exits the cerebral aqueduct via Sylvius's foramen and flows directly into the cisterna magna.

Context: James Long believed that the British mercantile community and even the Government unjustly and oppressively treated the Indigo cultivators . His view concurred with Dinabandhu Mitra who expressed his sentiments in a play entitled Nil Darpan ( the original Bengali play was written by him ) and published anonymously from Dhaka in 1860 . Mitra sent Long a copy of the play as early as 1861 . Long brought it to the notice of W. S Seton - Karr , Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission . Seton - Karr , sensing its importance , mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor , Grant. Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends . After the discussion , Seton - Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English . Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long . Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play . When the translation was complete , Seton - Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant 's wish of a few copies . Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel , the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs. 300 . It was published in April or May 1861 . Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor , Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading : `` on her Majesty 's Service '' . The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters . It naturally offended the establishment of the play so much that a razing propaganda was started by the Anglo - Indian Press against the publisher and the translator . One of the leading newspapers named The Englishmen and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer - C.H. Manuel . The words mentioned in Long 's Introduction to the play stated that what was presented in it was `` plain but true '' . This was subsequently used by the planters in their prosecution of Long for publishing defamatory statements .
Question: who translated the play neel darpan into english
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who translated ""Nil Darpan"" into English based on the context provided. Let me read through the context carefully.

Specifically Wally Palmar Mike Skill and Jimmy Marinos are mentioned as the writers and contributors. Additionally it's stated that Jimmy Marinos is the lead vocalist on the song. Since The Romantics is an American rock band their original performance would be the answer to this question.  I don't see any information suggesting that another artist or group originally sang this song; instead it was written by The Romlicants themselves for their album and single release.

354,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: A blighted ovum or anembryonic gestation is characterized by a normal - appearing gestational sac , but the absence of an embryo . It likely occurs as a result of early embryonic death with continued development of the trophoblast . When small , the sac can not be distinguished from the early normal pregnancy , as there may be a yolk sac , though a fetal pole is not seen . For diagnosis , the sac must be of sufficient size that the absence of normal embryonic elements is established . The criteria depends on the type of ultrasound exam performed . A pregnancy is anembryonic if a transvaginal ultrasound reveals a sac with a mean gestational sac diameter ( MGD ) greater than 25 mm and no yolk sac , or an MGD > 25 mm with no embryo . Transabdominal imaging without transvaginal scanning may be sufficient for diagnosing early pregnancy failure when an embryo whose crown -- rump length is 15 mm or more has no visible cardiac activity .
Question: gestational sac and yolk sac but no baby at 7 weeks
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what's going on with this pregnancy situation. The context says that a blighted ovum happens when there's a gestational sac that looks normal like an early pregnancy but without any embryo. It usually means the embryo died early and the trophoblast kept developing.  In this case the person is at 7 weeks and they have both a gestational sac and a yolk sac but no baby. Hmm wait shouldn't there be a yolk sac only if the blastocyst has formed? Or maybe that's not right. I think normally in early pregnancy you see a yolk sac because the embryo is present. But here they're saying there's just a gestational sac and no embryo.  So considering the context at 7 weeks which is pretty early on if there's a yolk sac but no embryo that might indicate something went wrong with the embryo. Maybe it didn't implant properly or perhaps it wasimplantation failure? The key here is the absence of an embryo despite having both the gestational sac and yolk sac.  The context mentions that for diagnosis using transvaginal ultrasound if MGD >25mm and no yolk sac or no embryo when there's a yolk sac. But in this case they do have a yolk sac so maybe it's an embryonic death with ongoing trophoblast development.  The answer from before was ""Anembryonic gestation"" because the criteria for that are met: MGD >25mm and either no yolk sac or no embryo. But in this case since there is a yolk sac but no embryo at 7 weeks which is early on it's likely an early anembryonic case.  So putting it all together the answer should be ""Anembryonic gestation.""

Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out who played Gareth in the movie ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" From what I remember Gareth is one of the main characters probably playing Richard Arithmet but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think... The context provided mentions several actors: Hugh Grant as Charles MacDowell as Andie James Fleet as Carrie etc. But looking through them I don't see ""Gareth"" listed. Hmm maybe it's not in the list they provided? Or perhaps Gareth isn't one of the main cast members but played a supporting role instead?  Wait no I think the answer is that someone else played Gareth in that movie because when I check my memory or other sources Richard Arithmet is portrayed by someone like David Bower.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where Wimbledon is held. The question is pretty straightforward but let me make sure I get all the details right based on the context provided.  Looking at the context given it says that Wimbledon has been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon London since 1877 and that they play on outdoor grass courts.  So the key points here are ""Wimbledon "" ""All England Club "" ""Wimbledon London."" Wait does that mean the club is named after the city? Or is the location of the tournament the city itself?  Let me parse this again. The sentence structure is: ""It has been held at the All England Club in Wimbledon London.""  So the tournament (the Championships or Wimbledon) is held at the All England Club which is located in Wimbledon which is a part of London.  Wait but Wimbledon refers to both the city and the club?

Question: who played the first phantom of the opera
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who played the first Phantom of the Opera. I remember that The Phantom of the Opera is a famous musical based on a novel by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. I think it's been around for a while maybe even produced multiple times with different casts.  Looking at the context provided there are several names listed under various casts. Let me go through them one by one to find out who played the first Phantom.  First Michael Crawford was in the original West End cast. Then Brent Barrett followed him. After that Anthony Crivello ‡ is listed but I'm not sure what the ‡ symbol means—it might be indicating something like a footnote or that he's deceased. Then Ramin Karimloo Christine Daaé Sarah Brightman Claire Moore † and another entry of Sarah Brightman Patti Cohenour †. The † symbols probably mean they passed away.  Continuing down there are more names: Sierra Boggess Elizabeth Loyacano ‡ Sierra Boggess Raoul Vicomte de Chagny Steve Barton Tim Martin Gleason Hadley Fraser Carlotta Giudicelli Rosemary Ashe Judy Kaye Elena Jeanne Batman Geena Jeffries Mattox ‡ Wendy Ferguson Madame Giry Mary Millar Leila Martin Rebecca Spencer Liz Robertson Meg Giry Janet Devenish Elisa Heinsohn Brianne Kelly Morgan Daisy Maywood Monsieur Richard Firmin John Savident Nick Wyman Lawson Skala Barry James Monsieur Gilles André David Firth Cris Groenendaal John Leslie Wolfe Gareth Snook Ubaldo Piangi John Aron David Romano Larry Wayne Morbitt Wynne Evans.  Wait so Michael Crawford was the first. But I also recall that Ramin Karimloo played him in a later version maybe a Broadway or West End production after his initial role with Andrew Lloyd Webber in another musical called Evita. So perhaps he wasn't the very first but one of the more prominent ones.  But according to the list provided Michael Crawford is listed as part of the original cast so I think he was indeed the first. The next names after him are Brent Barrett and Anthony Crivello ‡ then Ramin Karimloo Christine Daaé Sarah Brightman Claire Moore † etc. but since Michael was first that's probably the answer.

Question: who played caesar in planet of the apes war
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who played Caesar in ""Planet of the Apes"" and specifically in the ""War"" version. I'm not entirely sure about this but let me think through it step by step.  First I remember that Andy Serkis was involved with ""Planet of the Apes."" He's known for his strong presence as Caesar which is a role he also played in the original 1960 movie. But wait wasn't there an older version? Yeah I think the 1960 film had Caesar as a less imposing character compared to the later films where he was more dominant.  Now ""War"" must be one of the sequels or perhaps part of the continuity established after the original. In the first sequel ""War "" Caesar is played by another actor because I believe Serkis wanted to portray different characters in each film for authenticity and variety. So someone else had to take on the role.  Who would be a likely actor to play an authoritative strong character like Caesar? Well-known actors who have proven themselves in action roles might fit. Someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger comes to mind because he's well-known for his physical presence and has been in various action films including ""Rocky"" series where he played tough characters.  Also considering the role of Caesar he's supposed to be a leader with a certain intensity. Arnold's portrayal as R增 (Riddick) in ""The终结er: Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is quite intense and fits the vibe of an authoritative leader even if it's not exactly Caesar. But I'm trying to remember if there were other actors considered for the role.  Wait but in another context I think it was Arnold Schwarzenegger who took over the role in ""War "" as he had done before with Serkis in the first sequel. That makes sense because Schwarzenegger's career included roles where he commanded respect and authority aligning well with Caesar's character.  So putting it all together the person who played Caesar in ""Planet of the Apes War"" is Arnold Schwarzenegger. He took over from Andy Serkis probably to give Caesar a more established presence and different dynamic compared to when Serkis portrayed him.

If an internal link intending to refer to a specific person led you to this page , you may wish to change that link by adding the person 's given name ( s ) to the link .
Question: where does the last name hidalgo come from
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the last name Hidalgo comes from. Let me think about this step by step.  First I remember that many surnames have roots in Spanish or Latin especially since ""Hidalgo"" sounds like it's Spanish because of the ""-lo"" ending which is common in Spanish surnames. Spanish origin often relates to Latin American heritage or historical influences.  I also recall that many Latin American countries have adopted Spanish cultural influences leading people to use Spanish surnames. For instance names like ""Gómez "" ""Jiménez "" and ""Rodríguez"" are pretty common across Latin America because of their Spanish roots.  Looking at the surname itself: Hidalgo is pronounced with a ""y"" sound in Spanish (as in ""síeyo"") which helps it flow better. This kind of name structure ending with ""-lo "" is typical for Spanish origin surnames often indicating a relationship to a place or lineage.  Additionally I think of places like Mexico and Spain themselves. Mexican Americans who are descendants of Spanish settlers would likely adopt Spanish surnames as part of their cultural integration. Therefore it's plausible that many people with the surname Hidalgo come from Latin America specifically countries where Spanish was an influential language.  I also wonder if there might be other regions or contexts where Hidalgo is used but given its structure and linguistic features it seems most likely to have a Spanish origin.  The last name ""Hidalgo"" has a Spanish origin commonly found in Latin America. It often reflects historical influences from Spain and its former colonies particularly among Mexican Americans.", last name hidalgo has spanish origin commonly found in latin america it often reflects historical influences from spain and its former colonies particularly among mexican americans,Spanish,0,0.07407407407407407,2.834199599994463,0.0009850465604157779,0.00028922995240980717,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when was the canadian pacific railway started and finished
Answer: ",Alright so I need to figure out when the Canadian Pacific Railway was started and finished based on the provided context about Toronto Terminal Railways. Hmm the context mentions that Toronto Terminal Railways is part of the management team for Union Station with CNR (Canadian National Railway) but it doesn't directly talk about the Canadian Pacific Railway.  Wait a minute I remember learning in history class that the Canadian Pacific Railway was one of the first transcontinental railways in North America. It started building from Vancouver to San Francisco in the early 1880s and then extended westward towards Los Angeles. But when exactly did they finish it?  I think the construction began around 1873 or so with several sections being built along the way. The completion of the main line between Vancouver and San Francisco was completed in 1884. Then after that they kept building westward towards Los Angeles adding more segments over the years.  So putting it all together the Canadian Pacific Railway started construction in 1873 with the goal of connecting thePacific coast to the east coast via San Francisco and then extending further west. The main line was completed in 1884 but they kept going until finally finishing the entire route by 1902.  The Canadian Pacific Railway began construction in 1873 and finished its extension to Los Angeles in 1902.

Question: the german princes who chose the holy roman empire were called
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which German princes were called when they joined the Holy Roman Empire after 1803. From the context given it says the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel was added in 1803. I'm not exactly sure what ""Landgraviate"" refers to here. Maybe it's a specific title or a particular count or something?   I know that after the Napoleonic Wars and especially with the defeat of Napoleon many German states were re-unified under the Holy Roman Empire in 1803. This was part of the Congress of Vienna and the process of restoring the Hohenzollern dynasty to rule over Germany.  The German princes who chose the Holy Roman Empire would be those who after the unification assumed a role in the empire. The House of Hohenzollern was one such family but there were others too like the Wittelsbacher dynasty under Countess Wilhelmine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and the dukes from Hanover. But I'm not sure if all of them are considered when it says ""the german princes who chose the holy roman empire.""  Wait maybe the question is more about the name given to these princes once they joined. The context mentions Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel but that's just one specific case. Maybe the general term for German princes who became part of the Holy Roman Empire was something like Electors? Or perhaps Counts?  I think after 1803 the Holy Roman Empire consisted mainly of the Electors of Germany especially from the House of Hohenzollern and the Wittelsbacher line. So maybe the term used for them is Elector. But I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate.  Alternatively perhaps the answer is referring to the concept of ""Landgraviates"" in the context of the Holy Roman Empire after 1803 but I think Landgrave was a title for a bishop in some German states before the unification. Maybe not directly relevant here.  Wait the question says they were added in 1803 so it's about those who joined after that year. The context only gives one example: the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. So perhaps the broader term is Electors or Princes of the Holy Roman Empire?  I'm a bit confused now. I think the correct answer is probably ""Elector "" as the Holy Roman Empire was composed mainly of Electors from various German states especially after 1803 when most had been restored.  The German princes who chose the Holy Roman Empire after 1803 are known as Electors.

Question: when was the wheel introduced to north america
Answer: ",Alright so I need to figure out when the wheel was introduced to North America based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that large-scale use of wheels didn't occur in the Americas before European contact. However there are small wheeled artifacts found in Mexican archaeological sites dating back to around 1500 BC. These are considered children's toys. It also talks about the obstacle being the absence of domesticated large animals like horses or llamas.  Wait so the question is specifically asking when the wheel was introduced. The context doesn't mention any wheels themselves being used by Native Americans before European contact. Instead it refers to wheeled artifacts which are smaller and probably for toys rather than actual vehicles.  Therefore if these small wheels existed as toys around 1500 BC that's when they were first introduced. So the answer should be 1500 BC.

Hmm but wait that's just the title of the song. It doesn't mention anything about Sonic Drive-In specifically.  I know that Sonic Drive-In is a popular chain of U.S.-based movie theaters often associated with old Western themes and sometimes with food trucks.

Question: which is the tallest building in the world 2018
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which is the tallest building in the world as of 2018 based on the provided context. Let me start by going through the data given.  First I see that the list starts with Burj Khalifa in Dubai at 828 meters or 2717 feet built in 2015. That's definitely a contender because it's over 800 meters tall. Then Shanghai Tower in China is next with 632 meters which seems significant but not as tall as Burj Khalifa.  Looking further down the list I notice that the ranking changes based on height and construction year. The other buildings listed after Shanghai Tower are all under 500 meters except for a few like Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur at about 451 meters each and some others like Two International Finance Centre in Hong Kong at 412 meters.  Now when I get to the end of the list around 2018 I see ""Burj Khalifa"" again at position 1 with 828 meters. There's no other building listed that surpasses this height. The next tallest buildings are Shanghai Tower at 632 meters and others like the Petronas Towers but nothing higher than 828.  I don't recall any major buildings between 2015 and 2018 that broke the 800-meter mark so Burj Khalifa seems to be the tallest in 2018.

Context: An episode of Arena , broadcast on BBC Four on 1 January 2007 , focused on The Archers . It was narrated by Stephen Fry and included interviews with current actors and scriptwriters .
Question: an story of country folk slogan used to describe the archers
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out a slogan for a group called The Archers. They're from an episode of Arena on BBC Four in 2007 featuring Stephen Fry as the narrator and interviews with current actors and scriptwriters.  First let me recall what ""The Archers"" is about. It's a TV show probably a series maybe similar to Game of Thrones or another popular drama. The context mentions it was broadcast on BBC Four in 2007 so that gives a timeframe. Stephen Fry narrated it which might mean he added his unique voice to the episode.  Now thinking about country folk that suggests a more traditional setting—village life maybe rural settings. The Archers could be a group of archery enthusiasts or perhaps knights given the name's similarity to ""The Archers"" from another show? Wait actually I'm not sure if there's another show with that name. Maybe it's similar to ""The Archers"" as in the 2010 TV movie about medieval knights?  But focusing on the context provided: the question is asking for a slogan used to describe The Archers. So perhaps something catchy and reflective of their nature maybe humorous or fitting their setting.  Since Stephen Fry was involved his style might be witty or clever. Maybe a slogan that's a bit snappy and memorable. Given it's set in country folk settings maybe something that conveys the rural life or the archers' dedication.  I'm trying to think of common slogans for archery teams or medieval-style groups. ""Archer Strong"" comes to mind but I don't know if that fits here. Alternatively something like ""Horse and Arrow"" could reference both the country setting (horse) and their role as archers.  Wait perhaps it's more specific. Maybe a slogan like ""The Archers Rise Again "" which implies enduring strength or continuing tradition. Or maybe something with fire because archery often involves bows and arrows—something like ""The Archers Set the Fire.""  Alternatively since The Archers is set in a narrative style with interviews maybe a slogan that's inspirational or about unity. Maybe ""Together We Shoot Straight."" But I'm not sure.  Wait the question mentions a story about country folk using a slogan to describe them. So perhaps something like ""Country Strong"" or ""Folk Tough "" but more specific to archers.  Alternatively considering Stephen Fry maybe a more creative angle. Maybe ""The Archers Back From the Frontlines"" implying they're returning from battle or hardship.  But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about other TV shows. If it's similar to The Archers (2010) which is a medieval fantasy series then their slogan might be along those lines. However since this one is set in country folk perhaps something less fantastical.  Another thought: ""Archer of the Heart "" but that doesn't fit perfectly. Maybe ""The Archers Strike Back"" to imply they're reuniting or retreating from some conflict.  Alternatively given it's about country life and archery maybe a slogan like ""With Arrow and Hoe"" combining the tools used in archery with farming or manual labor.  Wait but I'm overcomplicating. Maybe a more straightforward slogan: ""The Archers Are Here!"" implying they're present or strong.  Alternatively considering Stephen Fry's style perhaps something with humor or wordplay. For example ""Reverse Archer"" playing on the idea of going back or reversing something.  But since the answer needs to be concise and direct without too much reasoning I think the most fitting slogan that captures both country life and archery is probably ""The Archers Set the Fire "" combining fire (possibly symbolizing passion) with archery.

Question: when is the strictly come dancing results show recorded
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the ""Strictly Come Dancing"" results show is recorded based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says: ""From Series 5 onwards the results show is recorded on the Saturday night directly after the live show and incorporates the result of the viewers' votes which are completed by 21:30. This was confirmed by the official BBC website in 2008.""  Alright so breaking this down. The key parts are:  1. ""results show"" is recorded on a Saturday night right after the live show. 2. It includes the results from viewers' votes. 3. Viewers complete their votes by 21:30 (which is 9 PM in the UK). 4. This information was confirmed by the BBC website in 2008.  So I'm looking for when the results are recorded. The context mentions that it's after the live show and includes the viewer votes which finish at 21:30. But wait does this mean the recording happens right after the live show ends? Or is there a specific time mentioned?  The exact wording is: ""recorded on the Saturday night directly after the live show."" That suggests that it's recorded shortly after the live broadcast concludes. However the context also mentions that viewer votes are completed by 21:30. I'm not sure if the recording happens at exactly 21:30 or just afterward.  But since the question is asking when the results show is recorded and the context specifies that it's after the live show which presumably ends before 21:30 but also includes viewer votes up to that time. Maybe the recording captures both the live performance and the viewer votes as they come in until 21:30.  Wait no—the wording is a bit tricky. It says ""recorded on the Saturday night directly after the live show and incorporates the result of the viewers' votes which are completed by 21:30."" So perhaps the recording happens right after the live show ends but then they also include all the viewer votes that were submitted up until 21:30. Or maybe it's that both events happen around that time.  But I'm not entirely clear on whether the recording is at a specific time or just immediately following the live show. Since the context doesn't give an exact hour but mentions viewers' votes are completed by 21:30 perhaps the show includes content up to that time.  Alternatively maybe the results show air after the live show concludes and also includes viewer submissions as they come in until 21:30. So it's not a single time slot but a continuous recording capturing both events around that period.  However given the phrasing I think the main point is that the results are shown on the same Saturday night right after the live show which also includes viewer votes up to 21:30. Therefore the timing would be approximately at or just after the end of the live show with content continuing until around 21:30 as viewers submit their choices.  But wait the context says it's recorded on the Saturday night directly after the live show and incorporates the viewer votes completed by 21:30. So perhaps the recording occurs right after the live show ends but then they also include all the viewer votes that have been submitted up until midnight. That would mean the results show is available starting right after the live show with updates as viewers vote.  So in terms of a specific time I think the show airs on a Saturday night at roughly the same time each week probably slightly after 21:30 to include the viewer votes. But since the exact hour isn't specified it's more about the timing relative to the live show and the completion of viewer submissions.  But the question is asking when the results show is recorded. The context clearly states that it's recorded on the Saturday night directly after the live show which incorporates the viewer votes completed by 21:30. So I think the answer would be that the results are recorded right after the live show ends and includes content up to midnight.  Wait but actually in reality ""Strictly Come Dancing"" typically air their-I-don't-know-when results show a few hours after the live show because viewers submit votes throughout the night. So they might record it as soon as possible after the live show maybe at 21:30 or so when the last votes come in.  But according to the context given the show incorporates viewer votes completed by 21:30 meaning that all the votes are in by then and the results are shown incorporating those. So it's not necessarily that the recording happens right after the live show ends but includes the viewer data up until midnight.  However since the exact time isn't specified beyond ""directly after"" the live show I think the answer is that it's recorded on the same Saturday night as the live show and includes viewer votes up to 21:30.

369,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: The term `` wedding soup '' comes from the Italian language phrase `` minestra maritata '' ( `` married soup '' ) , which is a reference to the flavor produced by the combination / `` marriage '' of greens and the meat . The minestra maritata recipe is also prepared by the families of Lazio and Campania . Some form of minestra maritata was long popular in Toledo , Spain , before pasta became an affordable commodity to most Spaniards . The modern wedding soup is quite a bit lighter than the old Spanish form , which contained more meats than just the meatballs of modern Italian - American versions .
Question: what type of pasta goes in italian wedding soup
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out what type of pasta goes into Italian wedding soup based on the provided context. The question is asking for the specific pasta used in this recipe.  Looking at the context it mentions that ""minestra maritata"" is an Italian term referring to a marriage of greens and meat often associated with a lighter soup. It also notes that some families in Lazio and Campania prepare this dish. The modern version is lighter compared to old Spanish versions which had more meats especially meatballs.  The context doesn't explicitly mention the type of pasta used but since it's an Italian wedding soup it might be similar to other classic Italian dishes like pasta primavera or similar light soups. However considering that it's inspired by a lighter version with fewer meats perhaps it uses something more delicate than thicker pastas.  In many lighter Italian soups spaghetti is often used because it's sturdier and can hold the soup well without clumping up. Alternatively shells might be considered but since the context doesn't specify I'll go with what is commonly used in such soups.

Question: who wrote old flames cant hold a candle to you
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who wrote ""Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You."" Let me start by going through the context provided.   The first sentence says it's a country song written by singer-songwriter Pebe Sebert and Hugh Moffatt. Okay that immediately tells me the writers are Pebe Sebert and Hugh Moffatt. But I should check if there's any other information about other contributors or versions.  Looking further down it mentions that Joe Sun had it as their number 14 hit in 1978. Then Brian Collins also covered it but since the question is specifically about who wrote the song not just mentioning performers I don't need to focus on those unless they're writers too.  Wait the next part talks about Dolly Parton covering it and including it on her album ""Dolly Dolly Dolly"" in 1980. But again that's a cover by someone else; Pebe Sebert is already listed as one of the original writers.  Then there's Kesha's acoustic version with Sebert's daughter but that's another cover and not relevant to who originally wrote it.  So putting it all together: The song was written by Pebe Sebert and Hugh Moffatt. No other people are mentioned in the writing credits beyond them.

Question: who plays harry's mom in harry potter
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who plays Harry Potter's mother in all the movies. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Harry Potter series. There are seven books and corresponding films. The question is specifically asking about Lily his mother.  I remember that Emma34 shared some context where she mentioned that Lily was portrayed as Mrs. Blackwood. In the context provided it says that Somerville played Lily in all the Potter movies. Wait no actually the context mentions that she plays Daphne du Maurier in a BBC drama called Daphne. Then it also mentions her role as Countess of Manton in the 2012 ITV mini-series Titanic.  Wait maybe I misread the initial question. The user is asking specifically about who plays Harry's mom in all the Potter movies. So looking back at the context: ""She plays a leading role as fictional Louisa Countess of Manton in the 2012 ITV mini-series Titanic."" Hmm but that's not related to the Harry Potter movies.  Wait perhaps I need to check again. The initial context says she played Lily in all the Potter movies. Wait no looking back: ""Somerville played Lady Stockbridge in Julian Fellowes' Gosford Park and Harry Potter's mother Lily in all the Potter movies."" Oh so that first part is her role as Lady Stockbridge but then it also says she played Lily in all the Potter movies? That seems conflicting. Or maybe I misread.  Wait no the context clearly states: ""Somerville played Lady Stockbridge in Julian Fellowes' Gosford Park and Harry Potter's mother Lily in all the Potter movies."" So that would mean she played Lily for all seven movies. But then later it says she plays a different role as Countess of Manton in Titanic. So perhaps in the context provided she was Lily for all the Potter films.  But wait I thought there were some discrepancies before. Maybe the initial answer was incorrect because of that. Let me double-check. The user is asking specifically about who plays Harry's mom in all the movies. According to the context given: ""She plays a leading role as fictional Louisa Countess of Manton in the 2012 ITV mini-series Titanic."" So in that series she's Countess of Manton. But when it comes to Harry Potter she was Lily his mother.  Wait but according to the context provided at the beginning: ""She plays a leading role as fictional Louisa Countess of Manton in the 2012 ITV mini-series Titanic."" So perhaps that's a different role than her portrayal in the Harry Potter movies. But then there was another part saying she played Lily in all the Potter movies.  Wait maybe I got confused with other actors. Let me think again. The correct actor is Emma34 and she indeed portrayed Lily in all the Harry Potter films. So perhaps the context provided has some errors or mixed information? Or maybe it's just a different source where she was counted as playing Lily for all movies.  Alternatively I might have to rely on the initial answer given in the context: ""She plays a leading role as fictional Louisa Countess of Manton in the 2012 ITV mini-series Titanic."" So perhaps her role changed between the Potter movies and Titanic. But the user is specifically asking about Harry Potter's mom so I should focus on that.  Wait no—looking again: ""She plays a leading role as fictional Louisa Countess of Manton in the 2012 ITV mini-series Titanic."" So that's her role there. In all the other Potter movies she played Lily. But maybe the initial answer was incorrect because it mixed up her roles.  Wait but according to the context provided at the start which is about her roles including playing Lily in all the Potter movies perhaps I need to clarify. Maybe the user is confused or there's some inconsistency in the information given.  But since the question specifically asks for who plays Harry's mom in all the movies and according to the context she did that then despite the other role in Titanic the answer should be Emma34 portrayed Lily.

Question: five tools of security management to overcome computer crime
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the five tools of security management to overcome computer crime based on the context provided. The context mentions Salvatore J. Stolfo but doesn't directly link him to specific tools. Hmm maybe he's a known expert in this area? Let me think.  I know that computer crime involves various tactics and tools used by criminals to breach security systems. So tools here would refer to measures or strategies organizations can implement to prevent such crimes. Common ones might include access control encryption monitoring incident response etc.  Let's see: the first tool could be Access Control Management. It ensures only authorized users have access to resources. Then maybe Encryption is another one because it protects data both at rest and in transit.  Next Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Monitoring Tools are essential for detecting unauthorized access or activities early on. Without them it's hard to stop a breach before it starts.   Another important tool might be Regular Security Training for Employees. Humans can be the weakest link; educating staff about security best practices can prevent many breaches.  Lastly Incident Response Planning is crucial. Having a plan in place allows organizations to mitigate damage and contain incidents effectively after an attack occurs.  I think these five cover different aspects: control protection detection education and response. That should help in overcoming computer crime by addressing multiple angles.  The five tools of security management to overcome computer crime are:  1. **Access Control Management**: Ensures only authorized users have access to resources. 2. **Encryption**: Protects data at rest and in transit from unauthorized entities. 3. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Detects unauthorized access or activities aiding early mitigation. 4. **Regular Security Training for Employees**: Educates staff on security best practices to prevent breaches. 5. **Incident Response Planning**: Provides a containment strategy after an attack to minimize damage.

Question: where did dr seuss wrote his first book
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out where Dr. Seuss wrote his first book based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that in 1936 the couple was returning from an ocean voyage to Europe when the rhythm of the ship's engines inspired a poem that became his first book: ""And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street."" So during this trip he wrote his first book.   I should check if there's any information about where exactly he wrote it or if he carried it with him. The context doesn't specify the exact location of writing but mentions that they were returning from an ocean voyage and that the inspiration came from the ship's engines. It also states that he was walking home to burn the manuscript when a chance encounter led to its publication.  Since the couple was on their way back it's likely that he wrote his first book during the trip. Therefore the place where he wrote it would be on the ship. But I'm not entirely sure if the question is asking for the location of writing or just the event. Given the context the answer should relate to the ship since that's where the inspiration came from and where he was returning.  Wait but sometimes people write at their home as well. The context says he walked home to burn the manuscript after the book was published. So perhaps he wrote it while on the ship and then took it home or used his home as a place to carry the manuscript. But since the question is about where he wrote his first book I think the ship would be the answer.  Alternatively maybe the context doesn't specify the exact location but mentions that he walked home after burning it so perhaps he wrote at home too. But based solely on the information given the primary inspiration was during the trip so the writing likely took place while on the ship.

During a pole 's winter , it lies in continuous darkness , chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25 -- 30 % of the atmosphere into slabs of CO ice ( dry ice ) . When the poles are again exposed to sunlight , the frozen CO sublimes , creating enormous winds that sweep off the poles as fast as 400 km / h . These seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor , giving rise to Earth - like frost and large cirrus clouds .

Question: what is the snow on mars made of
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what the snow on Mars is made of based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that Mars has two permanent polar ice caps. During winter these polar regions are in continuous darkness which causes a significant portion of the atmosphere to be deposited as dry ice or CO2 ice. Dry ice sublimes when exposed to sunlight creating strong winds that transport dust and water vapor leading to frost and cirrus clouds observed by rovers like Opportunity.  Now focusing on the question: ""What is the snow on Mars made of?"" From what I remember about other planets Earth's polar caps have water ice. But here it says during winter CO2 is deposited as slabs of dry ice (CO ice) at 25-30% of the atmosphere. So that must be the material for Mars' snow.  Wait but sometimes people confuse Mars' surface materials with other celestial bodies. For instance asteroids have silicates and minerals comets have water but Mars has both ice and rocks. But in this case it's specifically talking about atmospheric deposits as CO2 ice during winter. So the snow is dry ice.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what the first covenant in the Old Testament is. The context provided mentions that the Noahic Covenant is unique because it applies to all humanity while the others are between God and the Israelites. But wait does that mean the Noahic Covenant comes before or after other covenants?   I recall that the Pentateuch refers to the first five books of Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers and Deuteronomy. The context says the Noahic Covenant is found in these so it must be one of those. Let me think about when each covenant was given. The Torah includes several covenants: the Israelite oath (Exodus 20) the Noahic Covenant (Exodus 7-8) the covenant with Bezalel and Othniel (Exodus 19) and others.  Wait in Exodus chapter 7 God makes a covenant with Noah about creating clean animals and instructing him to build an ark. Then in chapter 8 he gives the Israelites the Oaths of the Land. But the context says the Noahic Covenant is unique because it applies to all humanity. So maybe that's the first one mentioned?  But I'm trying to remember if the very first covenant was with Abraham or something else. No the context mentions the Pentateuch starts with Genesis and includes Exodus so perhaps the first covenant in the Old Testament is the Noahic Covenant as it's part of the Torah but comes later than other covenants like the Israelite oath.  Wait no the question is about what's the first covenant in the Old Testament. The user provided that the answer is ""The Noahic Covenant "" so maybe I should just stick with that based on the context given.  The first covenant in the Old Testament is the Noahic Covenant.", first covenant in old testament is noahic covenant,the Noahic Covenant,0,0.4,3.104503199996543,0.0010833012940383523,0.00031807956528262456,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who sings the theme song for living single
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who sings the theme song for ""Living Single."" From the context provided it seems like the show is about a dating reality TV show called ""Living Single "" which had multiple seasons. The first part of the answer mentions Queen Latifah as the opening theme performer. But wait is Queen Latifah actually in the show? I know she's an actress and singer but does she perform the theme song?  Looking back at the context it says the opening theme is ""We Are Living Single "" which was written and performed by Queen Latifah. That makes sense because sometimes shows commission songs for their themes. So even though she's not the main performer in the show itself she did sing the theme.  I should also check if there are other performers mentioned but from what I see only Queen Latifah is listed as the one who performed the theme song.

Context: The History of Little Goody Two - Shoes is a children 's story published by John Newbery in London in 1765 . The story popularized the phrase `` goody two - shoes '' , often used to describe an excessively virtuous person , a do - gooder .
Question: where did the term goody two shoes come from
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the term ""goody two shoes"" comes from. From what I remember in the context provided it's mentioned that the story was published by John Newbery in 1765. The story popularized the phrase which is used to describe an overly virtuous or do-gooder person.  Wait so the question is asking where the term came from. Since the story is called ""The History of Little Goody Two Shoes "" it's likely that the term originated within this book. So John Newbery created the character Little Goody Two Shoes as part of his narrative to introduce and popularize the phrase.  I think that makes sense because in the context given they mention that the story popularized the phrase by using a specific character name. Therefore the origin is directly tied to the creation of this character within Newbery's work.

Question: who became a leader of the indian national congress
Answer: ","Alright so I'm trying to figure out who became the leader of the Indian National Congress after the election in 1997. The context given is from the 6th Lok Sabha session which took place between 1997 and 1998. Specifically it mentions ""I.K. Gujral 1997–98 1 year Bihar (Rajya Sabha).""   First I need to understand what this context is about. It seems like a record of a meeting or an event where someone named I.K. Gujral was involved in the Rajya Sabha during the 6th Lok Sabha session. The Rajya Sabha refers to the Senate in India's Parliament.  Now considering that the Indian National Congress was the ruling party at that time under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi it's likely that a leader of this party was elected or appointed during this period. I.K. Gujral is actually known as the first总理 of India after partition becoming the first Prime Minister of independent India in 1947 with Jawaharlal Nehru. So he wasn't around for the 6th Lok Sabha which came much later.  Given that it's possible that the context provided might be a misdirection or perhaps part of an address or speech made by Gujral during this time. However since he wasn't in power then maybe the answer refers to someone else. Alternatively if I.K. Gujral is mentioned here as the leader but considering his timeline that seems unlikely.  Wait another thought: the term ""Rajya Sabha"" specifically refers to the upper house (senate) while the Lok Sabha is the lower house (parliament). The Indian National Congress was led by Indira Gandhi during her tenure from 1964 to 1980. So if there's a reference to I.K. Gujral perhaps he wasn't the leader of the Indian National Congress but someone else.  But looking back at the context provided: ""I.K. Gujral 1997–98 1 year Bihar (Rajya Sabha)."" This might indicate that during the Rajya Sabha session from 1997-98 I.K. Gujral was involved in some capacity. If he wasn't a member of the Rajya Sabha at that time perhaps this is part of his speech or an address made by him.  Alternatively if the question refers to who led the Indian National Congress in the 6th Lok Sabha session then perhaps it's not Gujral but someone else. However since I'm only provided with this specific context about Gujral and the Rajya Sabha maybe the answer is that I.K. Gujral was the leader of the Indian National Congress during this period.  But that doesn't make sense because he wasn't in power then. Therefore perhaps the context is incorrect or misleading. Alternatively it could be a misinterpretation but given the information I have to work with what's provided.  I.K. Gujral did not become the leader of the Indian National Congress during the 1997–98 Lok Sabha session as he was not in power at that time.",ik gujral did not become leader of indian national congress during 1997–98 lok sabha session as he was not in power at that time,Mahatma Gandhi,0,0.0,5.32155629999761,0.0018687595629107675,0.0005487062857393395,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: Tierra del Fuego ( / tiˈɛərə dɛl ˈfweɪɡoʊ / , Spanish : ( ˈtjera ðel ˈfweɣo ) ; Spanish for `` Land of Fire '' ) is an archipelago off the southernmost tip of the South American mainland , across the Strait of Magellan . The archipelago consists of the main island , Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego , with an area of 48,100 km ( 18,572 sq mi ) , and a group of many islands , including Cape Horn and Diego Ramírez Islands . Tierra del Fuego is divided between Chile and Argentina , with the latter controlling the eastern half of the main island and the former the western half plus the islands south of Beagle Channel . The southernmost extent of the archipelago is at about latitude 55 S .
Question: where is the tierra del fuego located on a map
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where Tierra del Fuego is located on a map. Let me start by recalling what I know from the context provided.  From the context it says that Tierra del Fuego is an archipelago off the southern tip of South America. It's across the Strait of Magellan which connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. That makes sense because many places in South America are near strategic waterways like this.  The main island mentioned is Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego with an area of about 48 100 km² or roughly 18 572 square miles. This gives me a sense of its size but doesn't directly tell me where it's located on the map.  It also mentions that the archipelago consists of many islands including Cape Horn and Diego Ramírez Islands. Cape Horn is an important geographical feature—it's the southernmost point in the Pacific Ocean and part of the Antarctic Treaty Area. That might be a clue about its location being towards the south.  The context then explains that Tierra del Fuego is divided between Chile and Argentina. The latter (Argentina) controls the eastern half of the main island while the former (Chile) controls the western half plus the islands south of Beagle Channel. The Beagle Channel is a strait located off the coast of South America separating Chile from Antarctica.  The southernmost extent of the archipelago is at latitude 55 S. That's quite far south so it must be near the Antarctic Peninsula or somewhere in the southern Atlantic or Pacific.  Putting this together: Tierra del Fuego is an archipelago located along the southern coast of South America stretching from the Beagle Channel in Chile to Cape Horn in the Pacific Ocean. It spans across both Chile and Argentina on landmasses but has islands as well off the coast.  So on a map it would be situated off the western and eastern coasts near the Antarctic region covering areas from southern South America into the Pacific especially around the strait that connects to the Atlantic via the Strait of Magellan.  Tierra del Fuego is located along the southern coast of South America stretching from the Beagle Channel in Chile to Cape Horn in the Pacific Ocean. It spans across both Chile and Argentina on landmasses but also includes numerous islands off its coasts.  Answer: Tierra del Fuego is located along the southern coast of South America spanning from the Beagle Channel in Chile to Cape Horn in the Pacific Ocean.,tierra del fuego is located along southern coast of south america spanning from beagle channel in chile to cape horn in pacific ocean,the southernmost tip of the South American mainland,0,0.13793103448275862,4.2273054999968736,0.0014804959517182035,0.00043470409508117856,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: how many times has the saints won the super bowl
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out how many Super Bowl wins the New Orleans Saints have had. Let me start by going through the provided context step by step.  First looking at the team's championships section it mentions conference championships and Super Bowl championships separately. The Super Bowl info says they won once in 2009 labeled as XLIV. Then under conference championships it lists a single entry: NFC in 2009. So that adds another conference title for 2009.  Wait but the Super Bowl is just one event per year. In 2009 they won both the Super Bowl and the NFC championship because the Super Bowl is part of the NFL season which overlaps with the Conference Playoff and Championship weeks in December.  So putting it together: the Saints have one Super Bowl win (2009) and a conference title also in 2009. Therefore they've won two championships in total—Super Bowl once and Conference once in that year.  The New Orleans Saints have won one Super Bowl which was their only major championship victory.

The context provided mentions that it's in the Columbia River Gorge which is in the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington. Since the user specifically asked for Oregon I can focus on that state.

Question: who played king theoden in lord of the rings
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who played King Theodin in ""The Lord of the Rings"" movie trilogy. Let me think about what information I have from the context provided.  From the context Bernard Hill is mentioned as an actor known for various roles including appearing in ""The Lord of the Rings"" film trilogy. Specifically it mentions that he played King Theoden (also spelled Theodin) in the BBC adaptation directed by Dame Hilary Mantel. The question asks who played King Theoden in the Lord of the Rings films.  Wait a minute but I should be careful here because I know that in some versions different actors play these roles. For example in the original Peter Jackson films it was portrayed by Richard Armitage right? But from the context given Bernard Hill is listed as someone who played King Theoden so perhaps he's referring to a specific version of the movie.  Looking back at the context: ""as the Duke of Norfolk in the BBC adaptation..."" Wait that doesn't seem related. Then earlier it says he played King Theoden in the ""Alan Bleasdale's groundbreaking 1980s TV drama Boys from the Blackstuff"" and more recently as the Duke of Norfolk in Wolf Hall.  Wait maybe I got mixed up. Let me check again: the context mentions Bernard Hill played Yosser Hughes in Boys from the Blackstuff (1980s) then as the Duke of Norfolk in Wolf Hall. But it also says he was known for roles in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. So perhaps in one of those he played King Theoden.  But I thought Richard Armitage did that. Maybe the context is referring to a different version or role? Or maybe Bernard Hill played a different character not King Theoden?  Wait no. Let me clarify: In the context it says he's known for roles in ""blockbuster films including Captain Edward Smith in Titanic..."" and then later mentions King Theoden as part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. So perhaps in one of the movies like maybe in the TV series or another version Bernard Hill played King Theoden.  But I'm a bit confused because I know Richard Armitage is famous for that role in the original films directed by Peter Jackson. Maybe the context provided refers to a different performance? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in their question?  Wait no—the user's question is asking about ""who played king theoden in lord of the rings."" From the context Bernard Hill is listed as someone who played King Theoden. But I'm not sure if that's accurate because my knowledge says Richard Armitage did it.  Hmm maybe there are multiple versions or perhaps the BBC version? Let me think: Alan Bleasdale's Boys from the Blackstuff was in 1980s so probably a different setting than the Lord of the Rings. Then he played King Theoden in Wolf Hall as well which is another historical period piece.  Wait but ""The Lord of the Rings"" movie trilogy has two versions: the original Peter Jackson's three films released between 2001 and 2013 where Richard Armitage was king of Meneldor (I think his name was slightly different). Then there are other TV adaptations. Maybe Bernard Hill played him in a different version or role.  Alternatively perhaps I should double-check the context again: ""he is known for playing Yosser Hughes [...] as the Duke of Norfolk in the BBC adaptation of Dame Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall."" So Wolf Hall is by Hilary Mantel and is another historical drama. Maybe he played King Theoden there? Or is it a different character?  Wait no—Wolf Hall is about QueenElizabeth I's court right? And King Theoden would be from the Lot so probably not related to that. Then why does the context say he played King Theoden in Lord of the Rings? Maybe it's another role.  I'm getting confused because according to my knowledge Richard Armitage played King Theoden. So perhaps the context has an error or refers to a different role. Alternatively maybe Bernard Hill did play him but in a different capacity or version.  Wait looking again: ""he is known for roles in blockbuster films including Captain Edward Smith in Titanic..."" and more recently as the Duke of Norfolk in Wolf Hall. Then it says he's also known for King Theoden in Lord of the Rings. So maybe it's part of his role in the TV adaptation or another version.  Alternatively perhaps the question is referring to a different character named King Theoden that Bernard Hill played elsewhere but I can't think of any.  Wait I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should just answer based on the context provided even if it conflicts with my prior knowledge. According to the given context Bernard Hill played King Theoden in ""Alan Bleasdale's groundbreaking 1980s TV drama Boys from the Blackstuff "" but that doesn't seem related to Lord of the Rings.  Wait no—the context also says he played King Theoden more recently as the Duke of Norfolk. Wait maybe I'm mixing up characters here. Let me read again:  ""He is known for playing Yosser Hughes  the troubled ' hard man ' whose life is falling apart in Alan Bleasdale 's groundbreaking 1980s TV drama Boys from the Blackstuff and  more recently  as the Duke of Norfolk in the BBC adaptation of Dame Hilary Mantel 's Wolf Hall . He is also known for roles in blockbuster films ... including King Theoden in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.""  Wait no—that can't be right. If he played King Theoden in the Lord of the Rings but I know Richard Armitage did that. So maybe the context has a mistake or perhaps Bernard Hill played another character named King Theoden.  Alternatively perhaps it's a different King Theoden altogether—maybe from a play or a different media adaptation.  I'm stuck because based on my knowledge Richard Armitage is known for playing King Theoden in the Peter Jackson films. But according to the context provided Bernard Hill played that role as well? Or maybe he did another role and the question refers to someone else.  Wait but looking at the exact wording: ""as the Duke of Norfolk in the BBC adaptation of Dame Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall."" Wolf Hall is a play or TV series about Elizabeth I so King Theoden would be from the Lot. So perhaps Bernard Hill didn't play him there.  So maybe the context has an error but since the user provided that I should follow it. But if the context says he played King Theoden in Lord of the Rings then according to that the answer is Bernard Hill.  But that contradicts my prior knowledge so perhaps I'm missing something here.  Alternatively maybe ""King Theoden"" in this context refers to a different character or role entirely not necessarily from The Lord of the Rings. But given the context provided it's part of his known roles.  Wait no—the question is about ""The Lord of the Rings "" so perhaps in that specific adaptation he played King Theoden. Maybe it's an older version before Peter Jackson's films?  Alternatively maybe he did a role named after King Theoden but not necessarily the same character.  I'm getting stuck because I can't recall Bernard Hill playing that role. So perhaps the answer according to the context is Bernard Hill even though my knowledge says Richard Armitage.  But since the user provided the context and in it Bernard Hill is associated with King Theoden in Lord of the Rings then maybe that's what we should go with.

Wait but I'm looking for who plays the dad now not the young Maurice. So in the new version which is Beauty and the Beast the original story involved a father figure Mr. Enchanted played by Mathilda Boudier-Lacour. But since the user mentioned Kevin Kline as Maurice maybe they're referring to the 2018 animated version where the voice of Mathilda is done by someone else.  Hold on in the original Beauty and the Beast from 1991 the father was played by AlbertQRS but I don't think that's relevant here. The user might be mixing up different versions or roles.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who sang the first line of ""We Are the World."" Let me start by recalling what I know about this song. From the context provided it's mentioned that the song has a verse-chorus structure with different artists contributing each part.  The first verse is sung by Lionel Richie Stevie Wonder Paul Simon Kenny Rogers James Ingram Tina Turner and Billy Joel. They sing the first verse. Then Michael Jackson and Diana Ross follow completing the first chorus together.   So the first line of ""We Are the World"" would be part of the first verse. Since the first verse is led by Lionel Richie it's likely he sang that first line.  I don't think I need to look up anything else because the context clearly states who sang each section.

Answer: ",Alright so I need to figure out where the Edinburgh Fringe Festival takes place based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that fringe venues come in all shapes and sizes using nearly any viable space available. It mentions places like regular theatres (e.g. the Traverse or Bedlam Theatre) function rooms (like the Assembly Rooms) churches and church halls (such as the Quaker Meeting House or Paradise in Augustines) lecture theatres including George Square Theatre conference centres other university rooms and spaces bars and pubs temporary structures like The Famous Spiegeltent and The Udderbelly schools a public toilet the back of a taxi a double-decker bus and even places in people's own homes.

Context: The California Gold Rush ( 1848 -- 1855 ) began on January 24 , 1848 , when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter 's Mill in Coloma , California . The news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad . The sudden influx of immigration and gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy , and California became one of the few American states to go directly to statehood without first being a territory , in the Compromise of 1850 . The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and resulted in a precipitous population decline from disease , genocide and starvation . By the time it ended , California had gone from a thinly populated ex-Mexican territory to the home state of the first nominee for the Republican Party .
Question: who discovered gold in the sierra nevada of california
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who discovered gold in the Sierra Nevada of California based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by mentioning that the California Gold Rush began in January 1848 when James W. Marshall found gold at Sutter's Mill in Coloma California. It then talks about how this news brought a large number of people to California and had various economic impacts.   It also mentions that Native Californians faced severe consequences due to the gold rush leading to a population decline from diseases and other effects. Additionally it notes that by the end of the Gold Rush California had gone from an ex-Mexican territory to becoming home to the first Republican Party nominee.  Now focusing on the Sierra Nevada region specifically. I don't recall any names being mentioned in the context regarding gold discovery there beyond James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma. The context doesn't provide information about other places within the Sierra Nevada having gold discoveries during this period.  Wait perhaps I missed it. Let me check again. The only mention of gold is by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill which is located near Coloma. So unless there are multiple sites in the Sierra Nevada where gold was found but from the context provided no other names or details about such discoveries exist.  Therefore based solely on the given information it seems that the only person mentioned who discovered gold in California during the Gold Rush was James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill which is outside the Sierra Nevada specifically. Since the question asks about the Sierra Nevada and there's no additional information provided about other discoveries there I can't conclude anyone else was involved.  So my answer would be that based on the context given the gold discovery in the Sierra Nevada of California isn't mentioned. But wait James W. Marshall found it at Sutter's Mill near Coloma which is in the Sierra Nevada region? Or is Coloma not part of the Sierra Nevada?  Hmm I might need to clarify where Sutter's Mill is located. From what I remember Sutter's Mill is actually in the Sierra Nevada area because much of California's gold discovery was concentrated there. So maybe James W. Marshall's discovery is within the Sierra Nevada.  But since the context doesn't specify and only mentions his discovery at Sutter's Mill without any further details about location beyond that it's part of the Sierra Nevada I think he did discover gold there.  James W. Marshall discovered gold in the Sierra Nevada region of California during the California Gold Rush in 1848 at Sutter's Mill near Coloma.  Answer: James W.

Context: Median longevity of Basset Hounds is about 10.3 years in France and 11.3 years in the UK , which is a typical median longevity for purebred dogs and for breeds similar in size to Basset Hounds . The oldest of the 142 deceased dogs in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey was 16.7 years . Leading causes of death in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey were cancer ( 31 % ) , old age ( 13 % ) , gastric dilatation volvulus ( 11 % ) , and cardiac ( 8 % ) .
Question: what's the average lifespan of a basset hound
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the average lifespan of a Basset Hound. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context mentions that the median longevity for Basset Hounds is about 10.3 years in France and 11.3 years in the UK. It also says this is typical for purebred dogs and similar breeds. Median lifespan means it's the middle value so half of the dogs live longer than this and half live shorter.  The question is asking for the average lifespan which I think refers to the mean. But wait sometimes median and mean can be different if the data isn't normally distributed. However without more information like the standard deviation or other percentile data it's hard to determine exactly what the average is based solely on the median.  Looking at the UK numbers again since they have a higher median (11.3 years) compared to France (10.3) I might guess that the average in the UK could be slightly higher than 11.3 if there are outliers skewing the data upwards. But without specific data on the mean or information about how skewed the distribution is it's tricky.  Wait maybe the context doesn't provide enough info to calculate the average lifespan accurately. It only gives medians and percentages of causes of death. So I can't really compute the mean from that.  Therefore since the question specifically asks for the average lifespan but we only have the median perhaps the answer they're looking for is just the median provided because it's the closest data available.  The average lifespan of a Basset Hound isn't directly provided but based on the median given in the UK as 11.3 years that might be considered the average if there's no additional data suggesting otherwise.

Context: Deposition is a thermodynamic process , a phase transition in which gas transforms into solid without passing through the liquid phase . The reverse of deposition is sublimation and hence sometimes deposition is called desublimation .
Question: phase change from gas to solid is called
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what the phase change from gas to solid is called. From the context provided it says that deposition is a thermodynamic process where gas turns into solid without passing through the liquid phase. It also mentions that the reverse of deposition is sublimation which sometimes means deposition can be referred to as desublimation.  Wait so if sublimation is the reverse of deposition then when something goes from solid to gas that's sublimation. That makes sense because I remember that sublimation happens when a substance goes directly from solid to vapor without melting into liquid first. So going the other way around from gas to solid would be the opposite process.  But in the context they say deposition is sometimes called desublimation. Hmm so maybe there's another term for it as well. If sublimation is solid to gas then gas to solid should have a specific name too.  I think I've heard that deposition refers specifically to the process where gas turns directly into solid. So when you go from gas (like steam) and it becomes snow or ice on a cold surface that's deposition. And since sublimation is the reverse—solid turning into gas—that would be the opposite of deposition.  Wait but in the context given they say deposition is sometimes called desublimation because sublimation is going from solid to gas so reversing it would mean from gas to solid is also called deposition or maybe another term. But I think deposition is more commonly known as that process without referring to it as a reverse of something else.  So putting this together: gas turning into solid without becoming liquid is deposition and its reverse (solid to gas) is sublimation. Therefore the phase change from gas to solid is called deposition.

Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out when the celebrities entered the Big Brother house based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again.  The first part says ""The eleven celebrities enter the new Celebrity Big Brother House after being sequestered from the public for a week."" Hmm okay that's a bit vague about the timing. It mentions they were sequestered before the first Head of Household competition and that Julie Chen informed them about an envelope with a random number. The winner would be safe.  Then it tells me that Omarosa was on number five which won so she was safe this week. But my main focus is on when they entered the house.

Question: who has the most all ireland hurling medals
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who has the most All-Ireland hurling medals based on this extensive list provided. Let's break it down step by step.  First I'll scan through each name and look for mentions of ""won a medal as a non-playing substitute."" That seems to be the criterion mentioned in the query along with the previous answer indicating someone has that distinction.  Starting from the top:  - **Cian O’Reilly**: He's mentioned in the context of winning medals but doesn't specify how many or if he was a non-player. So probably not relevant here.  - **Conal Quigley**: Also no mention of medals here.  - **Timur Ahmadi** **Seamus Doogan** etc. : These are all based on the Gaels迎面而来的 mentions and don't indicate medal wins related to hurling.  Looking further down names like **Mick O’Reilly** come up in relation to football medals but not hurling. The query is about hurling specifically so that's probably not it.  Continuing through the list:  - **John Walsh**: He has mentions of medals as a non-player substitute multiple times (1957 appears several times). This suggests he might have multiple medals as substitutes. That could be a lead.  - Others like **Dan O’Reilly** **Colm Sheehan** don't seem to have any medal mentions in hurling either.  Focusing back on John Walsh the fact that he's listed under ""non-playing substitute"" multiple times indicates that he might have won several medals. The previous answer mentioned him as having such a distinction so it makes sense that he might be leading in terms of medals.

Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when Muhammad Ali won his Olympic gold medal. The context provided mentions that Clay started training at 12 won a gold medal at 18 in 1960 and then later became Muhammad Ali. It also says he won the titles in 1964.  Wait so if he was 18 years old in 1960 that would mean he was born in 1942 because 1960 minus 18 is 1942. Then when he converted to Islam and changed his name at age 22 in 1964 which makes sense since 1964 - 1942 = 22.  But the context also says he won a gold medal in 1960 during the Olympics. That would be consistent because he was only 18 then. So that's his first major achievement at 1960 and then later in 1964 after changing his name.

Then the movie was released on November 14 2001. So I guess the making period would be from the beginning of filming until release.   I remember that movies usually take some time to make after filming starts. So if filming began in September 2000 production probably continued through the year. The end date is July 2001 so it finished just before the next year's start.  Then they released it a few months later November 2001. That makes sense because after all the filming and post-production work it takes time to release the movie.  I think that's about it.

Question: surface area in many kinds of organs is important because the amount of surface determines
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what part of plants is determined by their surface area. The context mentions that plants have a high density of stomata and air spaces within leaves. It also says that one cell has constant air flow through stomata.   Hmm thinking about how plants transport water. Stomata are pores on the leaves right? They allow CO2 in and help in transpiration which is the process of releasing water vapor. If there's a high density of stomata maybe that affects the rate at which water evaporates.  So surface area... I guess it relates to how much water can be absorbed or lost through the epidermis layer of the plant. The more surface area the more contact points for absorbing water from the soil and releasing water vapor into the air. That makes sense because a larger surface area would mean more cells are available for these processes.  Also since stomata are in the epidermis (the outer layer) their density affects how much CO2 is taken in but also probably influences evaporation. So if plants have a lot of stomata maybe they're better at taking in air and water which could be important for photosynthesis and maintaining moisture.  Putting it all together the surface area is crucial because it determines the rate of water absorption and transpiration through stomata. This helps the plant efficiently manage its水分 intake and loss.  The surface area in many kinds of plants is important because it determines the rate of water absorption and transpiration through stomata aiding efficient water management for processes like photosynthesis and maintaining moisture balance.

Hmm from the context given it talks about films being adapted into plays and vice versa mentioning John Waters' adaptations like Hairspray and Cry-Baby. It also mentions Spamalot based on Monty Python films and another case where a film was adapted from a stage musical.  Wait but the question is specifically about when a book was first made into a movie. The context doesn't directly mention any books being turned into movies.

On both sides of the river , the mountains rise to much higher elevations , especially to the south where two prominent mountains overlook the valley : Sahuasiray , 5,818 metres ( 19,088 ft ) and Veronica , 5,893 metres ( 19,334 ft ) in elevation .

Question: what is the altitude of the sacred valley in peru
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the altitude of the Sacred Valley in Peru based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by talking about the Sacred Valley running generally west to east and including areas along the Urubamba River from Písac westward to Machu Piccu. It mentions that the elevation varies between 3 000 meters above sea level at Pisac and 2 050 meters below the Citadel of Machu Picchu. Hmm so it's saying that on either side of the river there are mountains with higher elevations particularly to the south where two prominent peaks Sahuasiray and Veronica reach up to 5 818 meters and 5 893 meters respectively.  So the Sacred Valley itself has elevations ranging from 2 050 meters at the river below Machu Piccu (I think that's the Citadel) up to 3 000 meters in Písac. The side valleys and terraced areas also contribute to a wider cultivatable area but I'm not sure if that affects altitude.  The key points here are Pisac is higher at 3 000 meters while the riverbed near Machu Piccu is lower at 2 050 meters. So when someone asks about the altitude of the Sacred Valley in Peru it's likely referring to its elevation range within the valley itself.  I should note that the answer needs to be concise and direct without too much explanation. The user probably wants a clear number or numbers indicating the highest and lowest points.

Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out who says ""I will not go quietly into the night."" The user provided a context about League of Legends and mentioned that Elementalist Lux from champion Lux uses this phrase.   First I recall that Elementalist Lux is part of the League of Legends universe. She has various skins with different themes or elements each associated with her champion Lux. The phrase in question sounds familiar; it's similar to something Sir Edmund might say.  Wait but in the context given Elementalist Lux uses this line so maybe that's a reference. However I know from previous knowledge that ""I will not go quietly into the night"" is actually from the poem ""Ursula's Nightingale"" by Lord Alfred Tennyson. The poem has multiple characters: the speaker a human; a wolf; and a nightingale.  In the poem it goes like this: ""Their darkened wings upon the evening fly  The cold wind breathes its kiss upon their cheek. Their love is stronger than the morning morn; They will not go quietly into the night.""  So in that context the speaker is unspecified but often portrayed as a tragic figure. However I don't think any of the main characters from League of Legends reference this exactly.  But wait the user mentioned that Elementalist Lux uses it. Maybe in the game's lore or skins she does say it. So perhaps the answer should reflect that it's Elementalist Lux from Lux.  Alternatively maybe it's a reference to her own character's backstory or theme. So if Elementalist Lux is part of the game and her skin references this line then it would be her.

Question: all the gases in the earth's atmosphere
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what all the gases in Earth's atmosphere are based on the given context. The context mentions that the Earth was being viewed from deep space during an eclipse as observed from Apollo 12 in 1969. Hmm not sure how that connects directly but maybe it's just setting a scene about Earth's atmosphere.  Wait perhaps the question is asking for the composition of Earth's atmosphere based on the context provided. The context doesn't give specific gas names so I might be recalling general knowledge here. From what I remember Earth's atmosphere is primarily nitrogen and oxygen. There are also smaller amounts of other gases like argon carbon dioxide and maybe some halogens.  But to make sure I'm accurate let me think again. Nitrogen makes up about 78% oxygen around 21% and the remaining is a mix of argon (0.93%) trace amounts of other gases like CO2 which are about 0.04% and tiny amounts of halogens such as fluorine and chlorine but those are negligible.  So putting it all together Earth's atmosphere consists mainly of nitrogen oxygen small amounts of argon and carbon dioxide with trace gases including some halogens.

Question: where does the last name galvez come from
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out where the last name ""Galvez"" comes from. Let me think about this step by step.  First off the question is asking about the origin of the surname Galvez. I remember that many surnames have roots in either historical figures or geographical locations. So maybe Galvez has a similar background.  I know that in Spanish-speaking countries many families are named after places. For example ""Guzmán"" means ""green"" and is often associated with regions like Guanajuato. But what about ""Galvez""?  Let me break it down. The name sounds Spanish to me which makes sense because Galvez has a Latin root. Breaking it down: ""gal-"" relates to water or the sea maybe from Latin. ""-vez"" could be part of a Spanish pattern like ""Gómez."" So combining these thoughts perhaps Galvez is derived from a Latin name.  Looking further I recall that in some regions especially those with significant Hispanic populations surnames are often based on place names or family traditions. Maybe Galvez comes from the Galician region of Spain? Galicia has its own language and culture so it's plausible that people there have the surname Galvez.  Alternatively it could be a variant of another surname or created directly from an Arabic name. But given the Latin root I thought earlier it might not be Arabic. However without more context it's hard to say for sure.  So putting it all together: ""Galvez"" likely originates from a Latin root meaning water-related possibly from Galicia in Spain.  The surname ""Galvez"" originates from a Latin root related to water potentially from Galician origins in Spain.", surname galvez originates from latin root related to water potentially from galician origins in spain,Spanish surname,0,0.11764705882352941,2.961099899999681,0.0010237794254383376,0.00030060271909653304,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: on which river did the exploration of the louisiana purchase begin
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out which river the exploration of the Louisiana Purchase began on. The context given is about Alexander Mackenzie crossing North America from Quebec to the Pacific between 1792 and 1793. Hmm I don't see a direct mention of a river here.  Wait maybe the context relates to historical events surrounding the Louisiana Purchase. From what I know the Louisiana Purchase was a significant U.S. government land purchase in the early 19th century. It involved several explorers and their journeys into North America.  I remember that in the late 18th century people like Robert LaSalle explored the region around what's now Louisiana. But the context here is from 1792-1793 with Alexander Mackenzie so perhaps he was part of an exploration team there.  If Mackenzie was involved in the Louisiana Purchase exploration I should think about where that started. The Louisiana Purchase extended from present-day Louisiana to what's now Alaska and Canada. So a key starting point might be on the Mississippi River because it's the major river flowing into the Great Lakes region which is part of the boundary for the purchase.  Alternatively maybe the Missouri River? But I think more likely the Mississippi because that's where much of the early exploration was focused. So putting this together the exploration probably began on the Mississippi River.

Question: who is the head of parliament in uk
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the head of parliament in the UK is. The context provided talks about the UK Parliament being bicameral with the House of Lords and the House of Commons. It mentions that the leadership has been held by different monarchs over time.  First I'll look for any information directly stating who currently holds the position. The context says ""Leadership Monarch Elizabeth II"" but then adds a date range from 1952 to present so maybe she's not the current one?  Wait in the House of Lords section it lists the political groups under ""Lords political groups"": Conservative Party (248) Democratic Unionist Party (3) Labour Party (197) and others. There's also mention of ""Crossbenchers"" with 183 members.  Looking at the Speaker information: The House of Lords has a Lord Speaker whose name is The Lord Fowler until September 2016 then John Bercow since June 2009. For the House of Commons it's ""Speaker of the House of Commons"" with names like The Lord Speaker John Bercow since 2009.  Wait in the House of Lords it says ""Lord Speaker The Lord Fowler Since 1 September 2016 Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow Since 22 June 2009."" So that's two separate positions: Lord Speaker for Lords and Speaker of Commons for MPs. Both have had different people.  But the question is about the head of parliament in the UK. Since it's bicameral both houses elect a speaker. The head would be the one with the most power or perhaps the highest ranking in their respective houses. However traditionally in the House of Commons John Bercow has been the Speaker since 2009.  Wait but looking again at the context: ""Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow Since 22 June 2009."" So he's the current Speaker for the House of Commons. The House of Lords' Speaker was The Lord Speaker until recently but I don't see a name provided now.  But the question is asking who is the head of parliament in the UK. In a bicameral system each house has its own speaker so technically both John Bercow and the current House of Lords Speaker are heads within their respective chambers.  However if the user is asking for the overall head or which position holds more authority perhaps it's the Prime Minister who commands the Commons but according to the context the Speaker is in charge. Alternatively maybe referring to the overall head as the monarch but that was Elizabeth II until recent changes.  Wait looking back the initial paragraph says ""Leadership Monarch Elizabeth II Since 6 February 1952."" That suggests she's still holding the title of monarch and thus perhaps the head in terms of the political leadership. But is she the head of parliament? Or does that refer to her as the monarch rather than the parliamentary leader.  I'm a bit confused because the current Speaker for the House of Commons is John Bercow but if Elizabeth II is still the monarch maybe she's considered the head in terms of the political leadership. However traditionally the head would be the monarch holding both houses' loyalty but parliament itself doesn't have a single head; each house has its own Speaker.  So perhaps the answer should mention both speakers and note that there isn't a single head for the entire parliament since it's bicameral.  The head of parliament in the UK is typically represented by the Speaker of the House of Commons who is currently John Bercow. The House of Lords elects its own Speaker separately.", head of parliament in uk is typically represented by speaker of house of commons who is currently john bercow house of lords elects its own speaker separately,the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II),0,0.11428571428571428,6.142105899998569,0.002166398298997795,0.0006360991470853353,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when did the smoking ban in public places start
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the smoking ban in public places started based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again.  The context mentions that besides cigarette pollution the National Fire Protection Agency found that other smoking materials like pipes and cigars cause fires each year. But it doesn't say anything about a smoking ban starting at any specific time. There's no mention of when public places began enforcing smoking restrictions or bans based on this information.  Hmm maybe I'm supposed to infer from general knowledge? Like usually smoking bans in public areas started around the 1980s or something. But since the context doesn't provide that I shouldn't rely on external knowledge. It's better to stick strictly to what's given here.   So based solely on the provided text there's no information about when the smoking ban began. Therefore the answer would be that it's not mentioned in the provided context.

Looking at the context again it mentions that Pakistan won the competition for the first time with a 180-run victory over India in the final at The Oval on June 1 2017. It also notes that this was the largest margin by any team in the final of an ICC ODI tournament.  Wait but sometimes people confuse the Champions Trophy with other tournaments like the ICC World Cup. I should make sure which one is being referred to here. The question specifically asks about the World Cup so perhaps there's a mix-up between the two.  However the context provided talks about the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy not the World Cup. So according to the information given Pakistan won that particular tournament in 2017 with an 180-run win over India.  But I recall that the 2017 ICC Cricket World Cup was a different event. It had several teams like India Australia West Indies etc. competing. The winner of that was India in 2017. So if someone is asking about the 2017 World Cup winner it's India.  Wait but the question says ""who won the world cup in cricket 2017 "" so maybe they're confusing the names because both tournaments happened around that time. The context given here mentions the Champions Trophy not the World Cup. So perhaps I need to stick strictly to the information provided.  The context clearly states that Pakistan won the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy final with a 180-run victory over India. Therefore according to this specific context the winner is Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in 2017 not the World Cup. The World Cup was won by India that year.  But if someone asks about the World Cup specifically it's a different tournament. So I need to clarify: based on the given context who is the winner? Since the question mentions ""the world cup "" but the context talks about the Champions Trophy maybe there's an error in the context provided or perhaps the user intended both.  Wait actually let me read the context again carefully. The first sentence says it was the eighth ICC Champions Trophy not World Cup. So the context is definitely referring to the Champions Trophy.

Question: where is the nfl game in london played
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where an NFL game in London is played based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by saying that initially all games were held in London. Then it mentions Wembley Stadium was the exclusive home stadium from 2007 to 2015 and continues until at least 2020. After that starting in 2016 the series expanded to more stadiums.  In 2016 they went to Twickenham Stadium in London for two years (from 2016-18). Then Estadio Azteca in Mexico City was added though it's just listed as ""2016--"" which might mean from the same year onwards. Finally there's a mention of Northumberland Park in London being expandable from 2018 to 2027.  So putting this together: In London the stadiums used are Wembley Stadium until 2020 then Twickenham for two more years (2016-2018) and starting in 2018 they're also using Northumberland Park. There's a possibility of expanding to Germany or Canada later on.  Wait but the question is asking where an NFL game in London is played. So I think it refers specifically to games that are held in London rather than elsewhere. From the context the initial location was London then they moved out for some years before returning.  So Wembley Stadium remains until 2020 and after that both Twickenham and Northumberland Park come into play from 2018 onwards. So depending on the year different stadiums in London are hosting games.  But since the question is asking where an NFL game is played in London I should note all possible locations given in the context. The answer would include Wembley Stadium (specifically) Twickenham Stadium for a couple of years and Northumberland Park as well once it starts.  I think the best way to present this is by listing each stadium with their respective timeframes.  The NFL games played in London are hosted at Wembley Stadium from 2007 until at least 2020. From 2016 to 2018 Twickenham Stadium in London was also used and starting in 2018 Northumberland Park in London became a hosting venue as well.

Question: what are the active materials of a lead acid battery
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the active materials of a lead acid battery based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that when a lead acid battery is discharged both the positive and negative plates become lead(II) sulfate (PbSO4). It also mentions that the electrolyte loses much of its dissolved sulfuric acid and becomes primarily water. Additionally it explains that the discharge process involves electron conduction from the negative plate back into the cell at the positive plate through an external circuit.  Hmm so when the battery is discharging both plates turn into PbSO4. That suggests that during charging or operation (discharging) each active material starts as lead in some form and ends up as PbSO4. Wait but what were they before? The context doesn't explicitly say but from what I know about lead acid batteries the active materials are indeed lead-based compounds.  So when the battery is new it's probably a different structure—maybe with lead in another form like Pb or PbO2 (lead oxide) for each plate. But during discharge these convert to PbSO4 on both plates. So the active materials would be what forms after some reaction occurs.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking about the active materials of the battery as a whole. In most sources lead acid batteries have Pb and PbO2 (lead oxide) as the active materials for the respective plates. When discharged they both form PbSO4 in the plates.  So putting it together even though during discharge they become PbSO4 the active materials are still lead-based compounds—specifically Pb and PbO2 on their respective sides.

Question: when did the soviet union first gain control of parts of poland and the baltic republics
Answer: ",Okay I need to figure out when the Soviet Union first gained control of parts of Poland and the Baltic Republics. From what I remember during World War II the USSR was involved in the Polish-USSR War around 1940 or 1941. That war led to the Soviet capture of some territories from Poland including Galicia.   Then looking at the Baltic states—like Estonia and Latvia—I think the USSR took control over there too during the same period. It must have been after the invasion of Poland in September 1940 because that's when the conflict really started. The Soviet Union probably expanded its control as part of their strategy to Occupied territories during WWII which eventually contributed to the eventual division of these areas between the USSR and Western powers.  So putting it all together the key dates would be around late 1940 or early 1941 when the Soviets gained control through military campaigns like Operation Barbarossa in June 1941.

Question: who plays david in alvin and the chipmunks
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who plays David in ""Alvin and the Chipmunks."" Let me start by looking at the context provided.   The context mentions that David Seville Alvin and the Chipmunks is created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. and the character was first introduced in 1958. It also says that in the film series David was portrayed by Jason Lee. Then there's information about the voice actors: Ross Bagdasarian Sr. voiced David from 1958 to 1972 and his son Ross Bagdasarian Jr. has been voicing him since 1979 onwards.  Wait so David is a character in Alvin and the Chipmunks. The user's question is specifically asking who plays David. From the context I see that Jason Lee was the voice actor for David in the film series up until 1972. After that Ross Bagdasarian Sr. did the voice from 1958 to 1972 which seems a bit conflicting because it mentions both as the voice actors.  Hmm perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me parse this again. The context says: ""Created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr."" and David's first appearance is in 1958. Then under Information it says that he was portrayed by Jason Lee for the film series from 1958 to 72 (I assume that's a typo and should be 1972). Then later Ross Bagdasarian Sr. voices David from 1958 to 72 but wait that can't be right because he created the character. Maybe it's a mistake.  Wait no perhaps the context is structured as follows: Created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. David's first appearance in 1958. Then under Information it says ""Portrayed by Jason Lee (Film Series) Voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. (1958 --72) Ross Bagdasarian Jr. (1979 -- present)"".

Looking again: ""Created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr."" Then under information ""Portrayed by Jason Lee (Film Series) Voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. (1958 --72) Ross Bagdasarian Jr. (1979 -- present)"". So it's saying that the character was created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. but then in 1958 he voices David? That seems odd because he's the creator.  Wait maybe I misread. Perhaps ""Created by"" is part of a different entry and under information the 'voiced' part is after that. Let me try to structure it correctly:  Context provided: - First appearance: 1958 - Created by: Ross Bagdasarian Sr. - Information:  - Portrayed by Jason Lee (Film Series) [1958 --72]  - Voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. (1958 --72)  - Ross Bagdasarian Jr. (1979 -- present)  Wait that can't be right because the character was created by Ross Sr. but then he's also the voice actor for it? That seems confusing.  I think perhaps there's a misformatting issue in the context provided. Let me try to parse it correctly:  The user provides: Context: David Seville Alvin and the Chipmunks First appearance 1958 Created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. Portrayed by Jason Lee (Film Series) Voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. (1958 --72) Ross Bagdasarian Jr. (1979 -- present) Information Gender Male Occupation producer  manager & father of Alvin and the Chipmunks Children Alvin  Simon  Theodore Nationality American  So it's saying that David was created by Ross Sr. but in 1958 Jason Lee portrayed him (Film Series) then Ross Sr. voiced David from 1958 to 72? But if he's the creator why would he voice his own character?  Wait maybe it's a different section. Perhaps under 'Information' is more about David himself: gender occupation children etc. but perhaps also the voices.  So looking at that I think the context might be saying:  - First appearance: 1958 - Created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. - Information (David):  - Gender: Male  - Occupation: producer manager father of Alvin and the Chipmunks  - Children: Alvin Simon Theodore  - Nationality: American  Wait that doesn't make sense because David is a character in the show. So perhaps the 'Information' part includes both David and the voice actors.  But it's unclear. Alternatively maybe the context provided has some errors or misformatting.  Assuming that ""Portrayed by Jason Lee (Film Series) Voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. (1958 --72)"" means that in 1958 to 1972 David was voiced by Ross Sr. but he's also the creator of the character? That seems contradictory.  Alternatively perhaps it's structured as:  - Created by: Ross Bagdasarian Sr. - First appearance: 1958 - Information:  - Portrayed by Jason Lee (Film Series) [1958--72]  - Voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. [1958--72] and Ross Jr. [1979--present]  But again if he's the creator why would he voice his own character?  Alternatively perhaps it's a typo and should be ""Created By"" instead of ""Created by."" If that's the case then:  Context: David Seville Alvin and the Chipmunks First appearance 1958 Created By Ross Bagdasarian Sr. Portrayed by Jason Lee (Film Series) Voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. (1958--72) Ross Bagdasarian Jr. (1979--present)  In this case it makes more sense: David was created by Ross Sr. and Jason Lee portrayed him in the film series from 1958 to '72 then Ross Sr. provided voice acting for that period but after 1972 Ross Jr. took over.  So focusing on who plays David:  - In 1958–72: Ross Bagdasarian Sr. - From 1979 onwards: Ross Bagdasarian Jr.  But the question is about who plays David in ""Alvin and the Chipmunks "" which I think refers to the original animated series. The film series would be different but perhaps the same actors are used for voice acting.  Wait no—the film series might have different voices. But according to the context in the film series David was portrayed by Jason Lee from 1958–72 and then Ross Sr. did the voice after that? That seems conflicting because if he's creating the character why would he also voice it.  Alternatively perhaps the correct information is:  In 1958 David Seville was created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. and Jason Lee portrayed him in the animated film released in 1958. Then from 1972 onwards Ross Bagdasarian Jr. provided the voice for David.  Therefore if the question is asking who plays David in ""Alvin and the Chipmunks "" considering that it refers to the animated series then:  - 1958–1972: Ross Bagdasarian Sr. - 1979 onwards: Ross Bagdasarian Jr.  But since the film from 1958 was directed by Ross Sr. and he provided voice acting up until his son took over in 1979 that's correct.  So to answer the question directly: who plays David? The primary voice actors are Ross Bagdasarian Sr. (1958–1972) and Ross Bagdasarian Jr. (1979 onwards). But since the question is general perhaps referring to the original character's creator.  But looking back at the context provided:  ""Created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr.""  So if David was created by Ross Sr. but then in 1958 he was portrayed by Jason Lee. That seems contradictory because if he's creating the character why would someone else portray it? Maybe I'm overcomplicating.  Perhaps the correct answer is that Ross Bagdasarian Sr. voiced David from 1958 to present with his son taking over in 1979. But since the question is about who plays him and considering that Jason Lee was the voice actor for the film released in 1958 (which was directed by Ross Sr. which might have been a different role) it's confusing.  Wait perhaps the context has some misformatting. It says:  ""Portrayed by Jason Lee (Film Series) Voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. (1958 --72) Ross Bagdasarian Jr. (1979 -- present)""  This could mean that Jason Lee played David in the film series and Ross Sr. provided voice acting for him during 1958–72 then his son took over.  But if David is a character created by Ross Sr. why would he provide voice acting? It might be a mistake or misformatting.  Alternatively perhaps it's structured as:  - Created By: Ross Bagdasarian Sr. - First appearance: 1958 - Information:  - Portrayed by Jason Lee (Film Series) [1958--72]  - Voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. [1958--72] and Ross Jr. [1979--present]  In this case David was portrayed in the film series by Jason Lee from 1958–72 and then from 1979 onwards Ross Sr. provided voice acting for other characters? Or perhaps he took over for David.  But since the question is about who plays David it's likely that after 1958 Ross Sr. was the voice actor until 1972 then his son took over.  So to sum up:  - 1958–1972: Ross Bagdasarian Sr. - 1979 onwards: Ross Bagdasarian Jr.  But since David is a character created by Ross Sr. why would he voice himself? Maybe it's an error in the context. Alternatively perhaps the correct answer is that Jason Lee portrayed him in the film series and then Ross Sr. provided voice acting for other roles or periods.  Alternatively perhaps the context meant that David was portrayed by Jason Lee on screen but the actual voice actor was Ross Sr. which seems conflicting because he created the character.  This is confusing. Maybe I should look up ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" to confirm who voices David now.  But since I can't access external information I have to rely on the context provided.  Given that in 1958–72 Ross Bagdasarian Sr. voiced David but also portrayed him in the film series directed by him perhaps that's how it is.  So putting it all together:  The answer would be that Jason Lee portrayed David in the first animated series (1958) and then Ross Bagdasarian Sr. provided voice acting from 1958 to 1972 after which his son took over.  But since the question asks for who plays David perhaps the primary answer is Ross Bagdasarian Jr. as he has been the voice actor in recent years.  Wait but if the question is about the character's current voice actors it would be Ross Jr. However considering that Jason Lee portrayed him in 1958 and Ross Sr. provided voice acting until 1972 then the answer might be either depending on which period we're referring to.  But since the question doesn't specify a time frame perhaps the correct answer is that David was voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. initially but now his son takes over.  Wait I think I need to clarify this based on the context provided.  In the context:  - David's first appearance: 1958 - Created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. - Portrayed by Jason Lee (Film Series) [1958–72] - Voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. [1958–72] and Ross Jr. [1979 onwards]  So during 1958–72 both Jason Lee portrayed him in the film series and Ross Sr. provided voice acting for David.  But since he created the character maybe the initial portrayals were different but he himself acted as the voice from 1958–72 with his son taking over after that.  So the answer is that Jason Lee played David in the film series and Ross Bagdasarian Sr. provided voice acting during 1958–72 then Ross Jr. since 1979.  But if the question is about who currently plays David (as of now) it's Ross Jr. as he has been doing that for a longer period.  Wait but in reality I think David was portrayed by Jason Lee on screen and by Ross Sr. in voice from 1958–72 then Ross Jr. since 1979.  So to answer the question directly: who plays David? The primary current voice actor is Ross Bagdasarian Jr. having started around 1979.  The primary voice actors for David are Ross Bagdasarian Sr. (1958–1972) and Ross Bagdasarian Jr. (1979 onwards). As of now the current voice actor is Ross Bagdasarian Jr.  Answer: Ross Bagdasarian Jr.",ross bagdasarian jr,Jason Lee,0,0.0,23.45884350000415,0.008355671898645492,0.002453397314109833,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: where does the karate kid 2010 take place
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out where ""The Karate Kid 2010"" takes place based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The first sentence says that principal photography took place in Beijing China. Then it mentions that filming began in July 2009 and ended in October 2009. Next it talks about the release date of June 11 2010 by Sony Pictures. The plot involves a character named Dre who moves to Beijing from Detroit with his mother and faces a bully there. He meets Mr. Han an aging maintenance man who is also a kung fu master.  So from this it seems like the story is set in Beijing because that's where Dre moves to and where the bullying happens. The principal photography location being Beijing indicates that the movie was made there and since the plot revolves around events happening in Beijing that must be the setting.  I don't see any mention of another place mentioned in the context for ""The Karate Kid 2010."" The only other city mentioned is Detroit where Dre comes from.

Question: who lives at the end of king lear
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out who lives at the end of ""King Lear"" based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again to make sure I understand all the details.  The context mentions several characters and their fates. It starts with Goneril committing suicide because her plans were thwarted. Then it talks about Edmund trying to save Lear and Cordelia but confessing against his character too late. After that Albany sends men to countermand Edmund's orders and Lear arrives bearing Cordelia's corpse. Kent appears and helps Lear recognize him. Albany then tries to convince Lear to return the throne similar to Gloucester's situation which has overwhelmed Lear causing him to die.  Now the question is about who lives at the end of King Lear. From what I remember in the play after Lear dies he's succeeded by his daughter56 but maybe that's not directly mentioned here. Wait in this context it goes on to say that Albany (in the Quarto version) or Edgar (in the Folio version) will take over. But since the user is asking about who lives at the end I think they're referring to Lear's descendants.  Wait no—the play ends with Lear dead and then his daughter56 taking the throne as her right. So perhaps that's not mentioned here. Or maybe in this context after Lear dies he's succeeded by someone else like Kent or Edgar. The context says that after Lear dies he has to be succeeded by someone else because Gloucester overthrew him. Then Kent declines to take the throne saying his master is calling him on a journey.  So if Kent doesn't take it who does? It's mentioned that Albany (Quarto version) or Edgar (Folio version) will become king. But the question is about ""who lives at the end "" so maybe it's referring to whether Lear's descendants are alive or not.  Wait in the play after Lear dies his daughter56 takes over as her right but I don't know if she's mentioned here. The context ends with Lear dead and then mentions that after he dies someone else steps in—maybe that refers to Cordelia's successor? Or perhaps the answer is that Cordelia's son young Hamlet survives.  Wait no. Let me think again. In the play after Lear dies his daughter56 becomes king but she has a son Hamlet who then goes on to have a lot of action in the play. But does he survive? Well in the end Hamlet is alive and becomes king himself.  But in this context it's more about the throne passing after Lear dies. The context says that after Lear dies someone else takes over because Gloucester took the throne from Lear when he was dead before. Then after Lear's death it's said that Kent declines so either Albany or Edgar becomes king. But the question is about who lives at the end.  Wait maybe I'm mixing up the versions. The Quarto and Folio are different editions of the play; Quarto has more characters including Hamlet as a son while Folio might not have as many? Or perhaps in this context it's referring to the ending where either Albany or Edgar takes over.  But the question is about who lives at the end. So perhaps it's Lear's descendants: Cordelia and Hamlet. But the answer isn't clear from the context given. Alternatively maybe the answer refers to whether Cordelia survives—since she carries Lear's corpse but in the play she does survive as her son Hamlet.  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline the key points:  1. Goneril dies and commits suicide because her plans were thwarted. 2. Edmund tries to save Lear and Cordelia but confesses too late. 3. Albany sends men to take over so Lear has to find someone else to take the throne after him. 4. Lear arrives with Cordelia's corpse (she survived by killing an executioner). 5. Kent appears and Lear recognizes him. 6. Albany tries to get Lear to resume the throne but he is overwhelmed and dies. 7. Then either Albany or Edgar takes over.  But the question is who lives at the end of King Lear. So perhaps it's asking about the fate of the main characters. From what I recall in ""King Lear "" Lear ends up dead his daughter56 (Goneril's daughter) becomes queen and her son Hamlet goes on to have a prominent role.  But in this context after Lear dies he is succeeded by either Albany or Edgar but the focus shifts elsewhere. Wait perhaps the key point here is that Cordelia survives because she was with him when he committed suicide. So maybe she's alive at the end of the play? Or does she die as well?  Wait no—Goneril commits suicide and Lear carries her corpse to bed but does Cordelia survive? In the original play after Goneril dies she marries young Hamlet. But in this context it seems like cordelia is with Lear when he dies so maybe she survives.  But I'm not entirely sure from the given context who specifically lives at the end. Maybe the answer refers to whether Cordelia's child (Hamlet) is alive or not.  Wait another angle: after Lear dies he can't rule anymore and his daughter56 takes over. So in that case Lear dies his daughter becomes queen and her son Hamlet goes on to become king later through different plots. But the context here seems to be more about who succeeds Lear rather than the direct line.  I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the possible answers:  - Cordelia survives because she carried Lear's corpse. - Hamlet is alive at the end as he doesn't die in this context. - Or perhaps the answer refers to whether someone like Edgar or Albany takes over after him.  But based on the provided context it ends with either Albany or Edgar becoming king. However the user might be asking about the main characters who are still alive—like Cordelia and Hamlet.  Wait but in the play Goneril is dead at the end because she committed suicide. Lear is dead as well. So her son Hamlet becomes the final king right? But I'm not sure if that's covered here.  Alternatively considering the context given perhaps the answer refers to Cordelia surviving and thus living with someone else—maybe not specified in the context.  But maybe the key point is that after Lear dies his daughter56 takes over as queen. So the people who live at the end would be Cordelia (as her son Hamlet becomes king) but I'm not entirely certain based on the given text.  Wait perhaps the answer refers to whether Cordelia survives—he carries her corpse so she's alive.  The final characters mentioned are Cordelia and her son Hamlet. Cordelia survives as her son Hamlet becomes king after Lear's death.

Question: how many series of diary of a wimpy kid are there
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out how many series of ""The Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" there are. From the context provided it mentions several book titles after the main entry. Each title probably represents a different book in the series. Let me list them out:  1. Rodrick Rules 2. The Last Straw 3. Dog Days 4. The Ugly Truth 5. Cabin Fever 6. The Third Wheel 7.

But wait the main entry says ""The Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" with a colon and then each title as separate entries like ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules"". So I think each of these is a different book in the series. Therefore there are 11 books total.  I don't see any indication that this is part of an ongoing series beyond these books. The context mentions that it's been published since April 2007 and includes print audiobook e-book media types but doesn't add more titles after ""The Getaway"".

Question: who comes after the president if he dies
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who comes after the President of the United States if he dies. Let me start by recalling what I know about the U.S. government's executive branch succession.  I remember that when a President dies or resigns someone steps into their shoes. The next in line is supposed to be the Vice President. But wait there are some conditions. Oh right! If the Vice President can't act for various reasons like being impeached or removed from office then we have other officials who take over.  The context provided mentions a specific order: Vice President first followed by the Speaker of the House then the President pro tempore of the Senate and finally heads of federal executive departments. So if the Vice President isn't available to assume the presidency after someone dies the Speaker would step in next.  I should also consider any exceptions or additional steps. For example sometimes there are articles of impeachment that come into play but the question is more about the standard order following a death.   So putting it together: if the President dies and the Vice President can't act (for whatever reason) then the Speaker of the House would be next in line to take over.  If the President of the United States dies or resigns the next in line is typically the Vice President. However if the Vice President is unavailable due to circumstances like impeachment the Speaker of the House of Representatives assumes the role immediately following a President's death.,if president of united states dies or resigns next in line is typically vice president however if vice president is unavailable due to circumstances like impeachment speaker of house of representatives assumes role immediately following presidents death,vice president,0,0.10256410256410257,2.553274699996109,0.0008805530946632468,0.0002585485193271073,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: oppo is sponsor of which country's national cricket team
Answer: ",Alright so I need to figure out which country's national cricket team Oppo sponsors based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.

Context: Iodine is a chemical element with symbol I and atomic number 53 . The heaviest of the stable halogens , it exists as a lustrous , purple - black metallic solid at standard conditions that sublimes readily to form a violet gas . The elemental form was discovered by the French chemist Bernard Courtois in 1811 . It was named two years later by Joseph - Louis Gay - Lussac from this property , after the Greek ἰωδης `` violet - coloured '' .
Question: where is iodine found in the periodic table
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where iodine is located on the periodic table based on the given context. Let me start by reading the context carefully.  The context says that iodine has the symbol I and an atomic number of 53. It also mentions that it's a halogen and the heaviest among the stable ones existing as a lustrous violet-black solid at standard conditions which sublimes to form a violet gas. The elemental form was discovered in 1811 by Courtois and named two years later by Gay-Lussac after the Greek word for violet.  The question is asking where iodine is found on the periodic table. So I should look at the information provided about its position. Since it's a halogen that gives me some clue. Halogens are typically located in Group 17 of the periodic table. The periodic table has seven main groups (I to VII) so group 17 would be column 17.  Now considering the atomic number is 53 I can think about where other elements with similar properties are placed. For example chlorine is element 17 and it's in group 17 period 3. Bromine is 35 also a halogen but a non-metal in group 17 period 4. Similarly iodine should be another halogen after bromine. So following that logic iodine would come next as element 53 so it's in period 5.  Putting this together: Group 17 and period 5 corresponds to position (IV V?) wait no periods are rows. Each period starts at group 1 so group 1 is period 1-2 for hydrogen then groups increase with higher periods. So iodine would be in the fifth period of group 17.  So on the periodic table Iodine is located in period 5 group 17.

437,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: Histology of sweat gland showing stratified cuboidal epithelium
Question: where do we find epithelial cells in humans
Answer: ",Okay so I have this question about histology and sweat glands. The context given is that the histology shows a stratified cuboidal epithelium. Hmm I remember from my biology class that epithelial cells are found in various parts of the body. But let me think more specifically.  Wait the question is asking where we find epithelial cells in humans. So I guess I need to recall all the places. I know epithelial tissues line surfaces and cover internal organs. The stratified cuboidal epithelium must be a specific type—right that's found in places like the sweat glands because of their structure.  But wait there are other areas too. For example skin has different layers: epidermis with various types of cells and maybe inner layers like dermis. Also internal organs have different epithelial lining: like stomach intestines etc. But the question is broader—it's asking where in general.  So I should list out all the main locations. The skin definitely uses epithelial cells—specifically squamous or occasionally stratified cuboidal maybe? Like for Sweat glands (stratified cuboidal) but also maybe other areas like cilia in the respiratory or reproductive tracts or perhaps in the female genital area.  Wait no the ciliary epithelium is different—it's usually non-stratified. So back to sweat glands: they are stratified cuboidal. But also I think the paranasal sinuses have epithelial cells lining them? Or maybe not—those might be pseudostratified or something else.  Another thought: the female genital area has layers of epithelial cells in the vagina and endometrial lining. So that's two more places besides sweat glands.  So putting it all together the answer would include skin (especially epidermis) internal organs like stomach and intestines the female reproductive system (vagina and endometrium) and maybe other specific areas like paranasal sinuses or others where cuboidal epithelium is present. But I'm not sure about that last part.  Wait let me think again—sweat glands are definitely stratified cuboidal. The skin itself isn't just one type; it has different layers with different cell types but the sweat glands' cells fit into that category. So the answer would be: epithelial cells are found in the skin (epidermis) internal organs lining their cavities and organs of sensation and reproduction and possibly other specialized locations like certain parts of the digestive or reproductive systems.  Epithelial cells are found in the skin (specifically in the epidermis) internal organs that line their cavities and organs of sensation and reproduction as well as in specific areas such as the female genital region (vagina and endometrium).,epithelial cells are found in skin specifically in epidermis internal organs that line their cavities and organs of sensation and reproduction as well as in specific areas such as female genital region vagina and endometrium,the cavities and surfaces of blood vessels and organs throughout the body,0,0.17777777777777776,4.4969249999994645,0.0015853272096277933,0.00046548471089638733,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what are some special products made in mississippi
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out some special products made in Mississippi based on the context provided. The context mentions that ""Mississippi Burning"" is a film about the FBI investigation into the 1964 murders of Chaney Goodman and Schwerner. It stars Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe.  Hmm okay so I'm looking for products or items that are specifically made in Mississippi based on this movie context. The movie itself doesn't directly talk about Mississippi's products but maybe the setting or the characters involved have something to do with it.  Wait the film is set around the Delta region of Mississippi right? Gene Hackman played the lead role as a local yokel named ""S-establish "" and Willem Dafoe played his friend ""B-jinx."" The Delta is known for its rich history in music like blues and country singers. Maybe the products mentioned relate to that.  So special products from the Delta might include things like moonshine which was a common product there. Moonshine was illegally produced alcohol often used by bootleggers before Prohibition. That's a significant product made in Mississippi.  Also considering the music industry Southern rock or blues could be mentioned as ""products"" since they're musical styles originating from the region. However I'm not sure if that's exactly what the question is asking for.  Another angle: maybe the characters are known for something specific. For example Gene Hackman might have a product named after him like Hackmans or something similar. But without more info it's speculative.  Alternatively considering the Delta's history there might be specific crafts or items made there like handcrafted items from local artisans. However the question is about ""special products "" which are likely commercial items rather than crafts.  Putting it all together the most probable special products from Mississippi based on the movie context would be moonshine and Southern rock music. Moonshine was a significant product due to its illegal but widespread use in the region.  The special products made in Mississippi as suggested by the context of ""Mississippi Burning "" include:  1. **Moonshine**: A illegally produced alcohol that was widespread in the Delta region during Prohibition era.  2. **Southern rock music**: A musical style originating from the region associated with blues and roots music.  These products are highlighted due to their prominence in Mississippi's cultural and historical context.",these products are highlighted due to their prominence in mississippis cultural and historical context,farm-raised catfish,0,0.0,3.8641221999860136,0.0013588456907261445,0.0003989850736548993,0.0,0.0,0.0

Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out who played Sarah Hedley in ""When the Boat Comes In."" From what I remember Rosalind Bailey was mentioned as Sarah Headley née Lytton. But wait is that right? I think she's an actress known for her roles in various TV shows and movies. Let me break this down.  First the question asks specifically about ""When the Boat Comes In."" That movie or show features a character named Sarah Hedley. I recall that Rosalind Bailey has acted in many productions so it makes sense she might be involved here.  Now looking at the context provided: Rosalind Bailey as Sarah Headley née Lytton (1977 81 / Series 2 - 4 / 23 episodes). The numbers likely refer to the year of release series number and episode count. So she played Sarah Headley in that particular season.

Context: On March 23 , 2016 , the NFL announced that it would award a touchback on kickoffs at the 25 - yard line instead of the previous 20 - yard line and much discussion and analysis on the impact of this change has emerged . This new rule was to be re-evaluated after the 2016 NFL season .
Question: what is the new touchback rule in the nfl
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out the answer to the question about the new touchback rule in the NFL as of March 23 2016. The context provided mentions that the NFL announced a change from the previous 20-yard line to the 25-yard line for kickoffs and that this would be re-evaluated after the 2016 season.  First I need to understand what a touchback rule is. From what I know touchbacks are when a team gets an extra point after certain plays like a safety or a missed field goal attempt. In traditional rules kickoffs start at the 20-yard line but this change moved it to the 25-yard line.  So putting that together the new rule would involve kicking the ball from the 25-yard line instead of the 20-yard line during kickoff. The NFL plans to review this after the season starts in 2016. I should make sure my answer is concise and directly states the change without adding extra details.  The NFL's new touchback rule involves kicking the ball from the 25-yard line on kickoffs replacing the previous 20-yard line start. This rule will be re-evaluated after the 2016 NFL season concludes.

Question: the fertile crescent is located between what two bodies of water
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the fertile Crescent is located in terms of the bodies of water it's near. From what I remember the fertile Crescent refers to the area in the Middle East and parts of North Africa that was known for its rich agriculture especially around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.  Wait but the question is specifically about the two bodies of water surrounding it. I think it's between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea or something like that. Let me visualize it: if you imagine the area stretching from what was ancient Mesopotamia up to southern Egypt which is in modern-day Syria and Lebanon.  So on the northern side it must be the Mediterranean Sea. On the southern end I believe it's the Red Sea because that's where countries like Israel and Egypt are located along the coast. The Euphrates and Tigris rivers flow through the region towards the east but they don't form a boundary; instead the water bodies on the west would be the Caspian Sea or maybe the Black Sea which are more to the north.  Wait no the Red Sea is actually east of the Fertile Crescent. So perhaps it's not between the Mediterranean and Red Sea because the Red Sea is further south. Hmm I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again: the fertility in that area was due to the fertile land along the rivers. The Caspian Sea is more to the north so maybe the Fertile Crescent is bounded by the Mediterranean on the north and the Red Sea on the south.  I think I should confirm this with some basic geography knowledge. The Mediterranean Sea is indeed located in the west encompassing parts of Turkey Greece and Italy. On the other hand the Red Sea borders countries like Israel along its southern coast. So putting it all together the Fertile Crescent runs between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south.  I think that makes sense because regions in the Middle East are often surrounded by these larger bodies of water on either side. Also the deserts extend westward beyond that area into places like Arabia but the fertile land itself is more bounded by those two seas.  The Fertile Crescent is located between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south., fertile crescent is located between mediterranean sea to north and red sea to south,Tigris and Euphrates rivers,0,0.11111111111111112,3.795171100005973,0.0013272462776761202,0.0003897068353462668,0.0,0.0,0.0

The plane was chartered by L&J Company of Addison Texas and they were flying from Greenville South Carolina to Baton Rouge Louisiana.  Wait a second did I mix up any details?

Question: who gets to race in the daytona clash
Answer: ",Okay I need to figure out who can race in the 2018 Daytona Clash based on the provided context. The context mentions that it's not a predetermined number and instead is limited by specific criteria.  First let me break down the eligibility rules mentioned: 1. Drivers must be Daytona Pole Award winners. 2. They should have won a previous Clash race. 3. They need to be former Daytona 500 pole winners. 4. The drivers must have competed full-time in 2017. 5. They also need to qualify for the 2017 Playoffs.  I'll go through each point and make sure I understand what each criterion entails: - **Daytona Pole Award winners**: These are drivers who have previously won the pole position in a Daytona race which is a significant achievement as pole positions often lead to wins. - **Former Clash race winners**: The driver must have won at least one Clash before. This shows they have experience and success in these types of events. - **Daytona 500 pole winners**: Similar to the Pole Award but specifically for the Daytona 500 another major event so this is a key indicator of their skill level there. - **Competed full-time in 2017**: This means they were active drivers during that year not just occasional participants. It adds a layer of consistency and reliability to their racing history. - **Qualified for the 2017 Playoffs**: Qualifying for playoffs typically requires meeting certain standards or having good performance in events leading up to them.  I should consider if there are any overlaps or if all criteria must be met simultaneously. The context doesn't specify if it's an either/or situation so I think each criterion is a separate requirement that the driver needs to fulfill individually.  So putting it all together only drivers who satisfy all these conditions will be eligible to race in the 2018 Daytona Clash.  The eligible drivers for the 2018 Daytona Clash are those who:  - Have won the Daytona Pole Award. - Have previously won a Clash race. - Were former Daytona 500 pole winners. - Competed full-time in 2017. - Qualified for the 2017 Playoffs.

The Red Knob models have a specific design including black knobs and early '70s unscripted tailless Fender logos that were added in 1996 when most manufacturing moved to Ensenada Mexico.  Wait so the move happened in 1996 right? That's when they started producing those models with the later design. But the original Red Knob amps were made from 1987-1993. So if production was split between different factories after a certain point maybe that switch to Mexico happened during that time frame.  But does the context explicitly say when Fender began manufacturing in Mexico? It mentions moving most production to Ensenada starting in 1996. That suggests that prior to 1996 they were making some models elsewhere. The Red Knob amps from 1987-1993 would have been produced before and after the switch.  So Fender started manufacturing in Mexico around 1996 when most of their production moved there. Therefore the start year would be 1996.

From the context provided it says that after World War II Yugoslavia was set up as a federation with six republics. These were divided along ethnic and historical lines.  I remember from history classes that Yugoslavia is one of those big countries that broke apart in the mid-20th century. Yugoslavia itself existed way before WWII right?

But wait in the question it's about who influenced Jefferson's substitution of ""pursuit of happiness"" instead of ""property."" So maybe Jefferson was influenced by someone else besides Locke?  Hart said that all rights depend on the right to liberty which is important. Green also mentioned life and liberty as primary rights. However the Declaration used ""pursuit of happiness "" so perhaps it's more about Jefferson's own reflections rather than Hart or Green.  Wait actually I recall that Thomas Jefferson was inspired by Locke's ideas but changed them for the US context. So maybe the answer is John Locke because his emphasis on life and liberty laid the groundwork even though he didn't specifically mention happiness.  But looking back at the context it says that despite Locke's influence Jefferson substituted ""pursuit of happiness"" instead of ""property."" That suggests that while Locke's ideas were foundational Jefferson might have taken some cues from others too. However I think the primary influencer here is still John Locke because his emphasis on these rights was central.  So putting it all together the answer should be John Locke.  The philosopher whose ideas influenced the Declaration of Independence with ""pursuit of happiness"" instead of ""property"" was John Locke as his emphasis on life and liberty provided foundational principles that Jefferson adapted for the US context.", philosopher whose ideas influenced declaration of independence with pursuit of happiness instead of property was john locke as his emphasis on life and liberty provided foundational principles that jefferson adapted for us context,John Locke,0,0.1142857142857143,3.013865999993868,0.0010380074347298568,0.00030478035558158956,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: By 2004 , 58 receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) were known , grouped into 20 subfamilies . They play pivotal roles in diverse cellular activities including growth ( by signaling neurotrophins ) , differentiation , metabolism , adhesion , motility , death . RTKs are composed of an extracellular domain , which is able to bind a specific ligand , a transmembrane domain , and an intracellular catalytic domain , which is able to bind and phosphorylate selected substrates . Binding of a ligand to the extracellular region causes a series of structural rearrangements in the RTK that lead to its enzymatic activation . In particular , movement of some parts of the kinase domain gives free access to adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and the substrate to the active site . This triggers a cascade of events through phosphorylation of intracellular proteins that ultimately transmit ( `` transduce '' ) the extracellular signal to the nucleus , causing changes in gene expression . Many RTKs are involved in oncogenesis , either by gene mutation , or chromosome translocation , or simply by over-expression . In every case , the result is a hyper - active kinase , that confers an aberrant , ligand - independent , non-regulated growth stimulus to the cancer cells .
Question: why does overexpression of rtks lead to cancer development
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out why overexpression of RTKs leads to cancer development. Let me start by recalling what I know about RTKs from the context provided.  RTK stands for receptor tyrosine kinase. From the context I remember that there are 58 RTKs grouped into 20 subfamilies. They play roles in various cellular activities like growth differentiation metabolism etc. Specifically they help cells grow by signaling through neurotrophins which makes sense since neurons need to signal each other.  The structure of RTKs includes an extracellular domain that binds ligands a transmembrane domain and an intracellular catalytic domain. When a ligand binds to the extracellular part it triggers structural changes in the kinase activating it by phosphorylating substrates. This activation leads to signaling through the nucleus affecting gene expression.  The context also mentions that many RTKs are involved in oncogenesis either through mutations chromosome translocations or overexpression. The result is hyperactive kinases that send an abnormal growth signal to cancer cells without needing a ligand.  So if RTKs are already involved in normal cell functions like growth why would their overexpression cause cancer? Well maybe when there's too much of them they become hyperactive. This could lead to uncontrolled cell growth because the signaling is constantly sending a strong signal for growth and proliferation.   I also think that mutations or overexpression can disrupt the usual regulation. Normally RTKs might have been activated only when specific ligands are present but overexpression might keep them active even without these signals causing cells to grow uncontrollably.  In summary overexpression of RTKs leads to cancer because they become hyperactive leading to excessive and uncontrolled cell growth.  Overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) leads to cancer development by making them hyperactive. This hyperactivity results in a constant signaling cascade that promotes uncontrolled cell growth causing the cells to proliferate uncontrollably.,overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases rtks leads to cancer development by making them hyperactive this hyperactivity results in constant signaling cascade that promotes uncontrolled cell growth causing cells to proliferate uncontrollably,"a hyper-active kinase, that confers an aberrant, ligand-independent, non-regulated growth stimulus to the cancer cells",0,0.27906976744186046,3.5118685999914305,0.0012239793250886362,0.0003593855317829338,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: where is net profit on the balance sheet
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where net profit appears on the balance sheet. Let me start by recalling what a balance sheet is. The balance sheet is one of the three main financial statements along with the income statement and the cash flow statement. It shows a company's assets liabilities and equity at a specific point in time.  Now looking back at the context provided: Net profit is calculated as net sales minus cost of goods sold operating expenses taxes and interest. So net profit is essentially the bottom line of the income statement because it represents the earnings after all those deductions.  Wait so if net profit isn't on the balance sheet itself where else could it be? Well sometimes companies report key metrics like net profit in their financial reports even though each statement serves a different purpose. The balance sheet focuses on the equity section which includes retained earnings. Retained earnings are affected by net profits over time.  So after calculating net profit for the period this amount gets added to the retained earnings account within the equity section of the balance sheet. That means that while net profit isn't directly listed as an item on the balance sheet it influences the equity part specifically retained earnings.  I think I should confirm whether there's any other place where net profit might be mentioned. The income statement is all about revenues and expenses leading to net income or profit for a period so that's separate from the balance sheet. So no net profit isn't on the balance sheet itself but affects it through retained earnings.  Net profit is not directly listed as an item on the balance sheet; instead it influences the equity section by contributing to retained earnings.,net profit is not directly listed as item on balance sheet instead it influences equity section by contributing to retained earnings,on the bottom line of the report,0,0.07692307692307693,2.7776634999900125,0.0009677969913329996,0.00028416512375562073,0.0,0.0,0.0

The context mentions that the current Premier since May 23 2013 is Sylvia Lucas. It also talks about her being the Inaugural holder of the position which means she took over before someone else did. The term length is five years and renewable once. There's another person mentioned as Manne Dipico who was the Formation Premier from May 7 1994.  So to find out who was the Premier in 2018 I need to check when Sylvia Lucas started her term because she became Premier on May 23 2013.

The user asked when it's going to start but from the information given the start date isn't explicitly mentioned beyond the season airing during winter of 2017-18. However since the premiere is on February 7 that would be the starting point.  Wait a minute though—winter can refer to different months depending on where you are in the world. In the Northern Hemisphere winter typically starts around December or January but in the Southern Hemisphere it's around June-July. Since CBS usually airs shows during specific seasons and this one is mentioned as airing during winter 2017-18 I think they're referring to the Northern Hemisphere's winter which would be later in the year.  But the context doesn't specify a start date beyond the premiere being on February 7. So maybe ""start"" refers to when it begins airing rather than when it starts.

Question: who discovered cells divide to make new cells
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out who discovered that cells divide to make new cells. The context given mentions a German botanist named Hugo von Mohl who made the discovery while studying Green algae called Cladophora glomerata under a microscope back in 1835.  Wait but hold on. I thought cell division was first observed by Robert Hooke way back when. He used a compound microscope and noticed something like cells dividing because he saw something called ""cells"" which were flat structures in plant tissue. So why is this context pointing to Hugo von Mohl?  Maybe the question here isn't about when cell division was discovered but specifically who found that it's through mitosis or something else leading to new cells. Or perhaps it's a trick because the original answer says Hugo von Mohl so I should stick with that.  But wait in reality Robert Hooke is more famous for discovering the cell and naming it even though he didn't understand much about their division. Hugo von Mohl was actually the one who described the process of cell division in 1835 which came much later. So if the question is asking specifically about when cells divide to make new cells then von Mohl would be correct.  However I'm a bit confused because traditionally Robert Hooke is credited with discovering the cell concept and observing what we now know as cells through microscopy. But since this context specifically mentions von Mohl in 1835 studying green algae under a microscope to find cell division perhaps that's the intended answer here.

Question: when will miraculous ladybug season 2 episode 12 come out
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out when ""Miraculous Ladybug"" Season 2 Episode 12 will premiere. From the context provided it's about 40 episodes listed with their respective air dates from January 2018 to June 2018 for the first season.  Looking at Episode 37 which is titled ""Gorizilla "" it's mentioned that this episode was scheduled to premiere on March 14 2018 in Canada on Family Channel. Then there are other episodes with their air dates up until Episode 40 as of May 5 and May 12 for the UK and Spain.  Since Season 2 hasn't been released yet I don't have information about its episode release dates. The user is specifically asking about Episode 12 of Season 2. Without knowing when Season 2 itself will premiere it's impossible to determine the exact date for Episode 12.  I should also consider that each season might have a different release schedule and without official announcements from the creators or distribution companies I can't provide an accurate answer.  The information provided pertains only to the first season of ""Miraculous Ladybug"" and does not include details about Season 2. Therefore it is not possible to determine when Season 2 Episode 12 will premiere based on the given context.

Context: Tug of war was contested as a team event in the Summer Olympics at every Olympiad from 1900 to 1920 . Originally the competition was entered by groups called clubs . A country could enter more than one club in the competition , making it possible for one country to earn multiple medals . This happened in 1904 , when the United States won all three medals , and in 1908 when the podium was occupied by three British teams . Sweden was also among the top countries with two medals , one as a member of the mixed team .
Question: when was the last time tug-of-war was an official olympic sport
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when was the last time tug-of-war was an official Olympic event. Let's see... The context provided says that Tug of War was contested as a team event in the Summer Olympics from 1900 to 1920.   Wait hold on it starts saying from 1900 to 1920 but then it mentions specific years like 1904 and 1908 where certain countries won medals. Also Sweden had two medals in that period. The context ends with the fact that Tug of War was among the top countries so I think maybe it's not continuing beyond 1920?   I remember that the Olympics have been held every four years since then but Tug of War wasn't always included. It started being official in 1912 right after the London Olympics in 1908 which had three British teams on the podium. Then it was part of the games until when? The context says up to 1920 so maybe it stopped there. So if I have to answer when the last time was that would be 1920.  Wait let me check again: ""contested as a team event in the Summer Olympics at every Olympiad from 1900 to 1920."" So yeah up until 1920. So the last year Tug of War was official is 1920.  The last time tug-of-war was an official Olympic sport was in 1920.", last time tugofwar was official olympic sport was in 1920,1920,0,0.18181818181818182,2.817197700001998,0.0009744954695667347,0.000286131934887821,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: The Rashidun Caliphs ( Rightly Guided Caliphs ; Arabic : الخلفاء الراشدون ‎ al - Khulafāʾu ar - Rāshidūn ) , often simply called , collectively , `` the Rashidun '' , is a term used in Sunni Islam to refer to the 30 - year reign of the first four caliphs ( successors ) following the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad , namely : Abu Bakr , Umar , Uthman ibn Affan , and Ali of the Rashidun Caliphate , the first caliphate . The concept of `` Rightly Guided Caliphs '' originated with the later Abbasid Caliphate based in Baghdad . It is a reference to the Sunni imperative `` Hold firmly to my example ( sunnah ) and that of the Rightly Guided Caliphs '' ( Ibn Majah , Abu Dawood ) .
Question: the rule of the three rightly guided caliphs was called
Answer: ","Okay so I have this question about Islamic history specifically about the caliphate. The context provided mentions the Rashidun Caliphs and refers to a period of their rule as ""the rule of the three rightly guided caliphs."" But wait looking back at the details in the context it says there were four caliphs: Abu Bakr Umar Uthman and Ali. So why does the question mention three? Maybe I'm missing something.  Wait perhaps the correct term is ""three successive caliphs"" rather than ""the three rightly guided."" Or maybe the original context was incorrect in mentioning only three when there were actually four. Let me check again: the context lists Abu Bakr Umar Uthman ibn Affan and Ali as the first four caliphs following Muhammad's death.  So if the question is asking about their rule period it should be that they ruled together for 30 years. But since there are four named maybe the question has a typo or I'm misremembering something. Alternatively perhaps in some sources only three were considered as successors after a certain event? I might need to stick with the context provided.  The context clearly states it's called ""the rule of the three rightly guided caliphs "" so even though there are four named maybe the answer is referring to those three who came after Abu Bakr. Or perhaps Uthman and Ali were also part of that period. I think in the context it mentions they ruled for 30 years collectively so regardless of whether it's three or four the rule was over a 30-year span.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about what the rule of these caliphs was called. The context says it's ""the rule of the three rightly guided caliphs."" So even though there are four perhaps the answer refers to that specific term.  The rule of the three correctly guided caliphs was referred to as:  **The era of Abu Bakr Umar and Uthman.**  Or more precisely   **The 30-year reign collectively ruled by Abu Bakr Umar Uthman ibn Affan and Ali.**  But sticking strictly to the context provided:   ""The rule of the three rightly guided caliphs was called...""", rule of three rightly guided caliphs was called,The Rashidun Caliphs,0,0.2,3.900046900002053,0.0013725407038503226,0.0004030062114907452,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who was the girl in the video brenda got a baby
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out who the girl Brenda got a baby with based on the context provided. Let me look at the information given.  The context mentions that the song's video is in black and white and was made to visualize what Shakur narrates. The first part shows Shakur and ""Brenda "" then the story starts. Ethel ""Edy"" Proctor portrays Brenda. So Brenda is portrayed by Ethel Proctor.  Now the question is asking who Brenda got a baby with. Since the video shows Shakur and Brenda together at the beginning it's likely that they are dating or in a relationship during that time. Given that the story starts after this initial scene I can infer that Shakur is the one who got pregnant with Brenda.  Therefore based on the context provided the baby was obtained by Shakur.

The context provided says that principal photography began in mid-July 2016 in New Orleans.  Wait a second but the question is about where we first met Netflix. Hmm maybe it's asking for the location of their initial meeting or where they started working together.

469,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: Before 1986 , people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14 , since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes , and those under that age seldom had substantial income . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction . Before this act , parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported . During the first year of the Tax Reform Act , this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed . The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents . In 1988 , the threshold was lowered to 2 years old , and in 1990 , the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old . Today , an SSN is required regardless of the child 's age to receive an exemption . Since then , parents have often applied for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth ; today , it can be done on the application for a birth certificate .
Question: when did they start assigning social security numbers at birth
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when Social Security Numbers (SSNs) started being assigned at birth based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that before 1986 people often didn't get SSNs until around age 14 because the numbers were used for income tracking and most under-14s didn't have much income. Then it talks about the Tax Reform Act of 1986 changing things so parents had to list SSNs for dependents over 5 if they wanted tax deductions. Before this act parents just trusted each other not to lie about the number of children.  During the first year after 1986 (1987) there was a big drop in seven million minor dependents claimed on taxes because of this new rule. The reason cited was that some were either nonexistent or non-custodial parents claiming deductions fraudulently.  Then in 1988 the age threshold was lowered to 2 years old and by 1990 it was reduced to 1 year old. Finally it says that today an SSN is required regardless of a child's age to receive an exemption and parents often apply for SSNs right after birth even doing so on the birth certificate application.  Wait so the key point here is when the policy changed from waiting until later in life to assigning SSNs at birth. The context explicitly states that today SSNs are required regardless of a child's age and parents get them as soon as possible including applying for birth certificates. That must mean the change happened around 1986 or after.  Looking back it says ""since then"" in 1986 when the Act was passed so I think the assignment at birth started happening right after that act. So from what I gather parents began getting SSNs for their children upon birth starting around 1986 onwards.  SSN assignments for children at birth began following the Tax Reform Act of 1986 as parents were required to obtain these numbers once they had dependents over 5 years old. The context indicates that by 1990 SSNs were mandatory regardless of a child's age solidifying this change post-act implementation.

Question: who supported states rights during the civil war
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who supported the states' rights during the Civil War based on the context provided. The context mentions ""Raphael Semmes ( Maryland ) -- Rear Admiral."" Hmm that's all there is.  First off Raphael Semmes was a rear admiral in the Union Navy during the Civil War. Wait so if he was part of the Union army or navy does that mean he supported the Union? Because typically supporting states' rights would relate to opposing federal authority and backing the Confederacy more.  But wait maybe being a rear admiral doesn't necessarily directly tie him to supporting states' rights unless he was involved in any specific actions. However the context given only mentions his rank and state so perhaps it's not indicating his stance on the Civil War issues at all.  So without additional information about his political affiliations or actions during the war I can't conclusively determine if he supported the states' rights. The provided info is limited to his rank in Maryland as a rear admiral.  The context does not provide information about Raphael Semmes's stance on supporting states' rights during the Civil War; it only mentions his rank as Rear Admiral in Maryland.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which album ""Help!"" by The Beatles is on. From the context provided it mentions that ""Help!"" is both a studio album and the soundtrack from their film titled ""Help!"". It was released in August 1965 as the fifth studio album for the band. There are fourteen songs in its original form with seven becoming singles from the vinyl album. Seven of these include ""Help!"""" and ""Ticket to Ride"".

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who ""he"" refers to in the song ""I Drive Your Truck."" From the context provided the song's narrator is driving a truck owned by his brother. The brother died in action while serving in the U.S. Army.   The co-writer Connie Harrington was inspired by an interview she heard with Paul Monti.

Question: what are the main sources of economic growth in the us currently
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the main sources of economic growth for the United States right now. Let me think about this step by step.  First I remember that economies grow when there's an increase in production and income over time. In the US which is a large economy various sectors contribute differently. I know that businesses are a big part because they create goods and services. But it's not just individual businesses; whole industries matter too.  Technology must play a role since it drives innovation and efficiency. Companies adopting new technologies can boost productivity and open up new markets. Then there's the workforce—skilled labor is crucial for growth as industries need people with the right skills to produce goods and services effectively.  Infrastructure is another area I think about. Things like transportation energy grids and internet connectivity are essential for businesses to operate smoothly. Without good infrastructure moving goods or communicating information becomes a bottleneck.  Investment in physical capital such as factories and machinery also seems important. Businesses invest in these to make production more efficient. Additionally financial markets help through savings loans and investments which fuel economic activities.  Taxes are part of the mix too—fiscal policy affects how much money is spent versus saved or invested. Trade with other countries can expand markets for US businesses and bring in goods that fill supply gaps. Lastly government policies like regulations and subsidies can either support or hinder growth if not aligned correctly.  Wait did I miss anything? Maybe exports and imports are part of trade but I think I covered that under international trade. Also maybe human capital refers to education and workforce development which is already mentioned. Okay so putting it all together: businesses technology skilled labor infrastructure investment in physical assets fiscal policy through taxes and spending international trade via exports and imports and government policies.  The main sources of economic growth in the US are:  1. **Businesses**: Through various industries creating goods and services. 2. **Technology**: Driving innovation and efficiency in production. 3. **Skilled Labor**: Essential for producing goods and services effectively. 4. **Infrastructure**: Includes transportation energy grids and connectivity supporting business operations. 5. **Investment in Physical Capital**: Factories machinery enhancing production efficiency. 6. **Fiscal Policy**: Influenced by taxes and government spending affecting economic activities. 7. **International Trade**: Exports and imports expanding markets and filling supply gaps. 8. **Government Policies**: Regulations and subsidies supporting economic growth when aligned appropriately.

474,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: The Rajya Sabha ( meaning the `` Council of States '' ) is the upper house of the Parliament of India . Assam elects 7 seats since 1956 and 6 seats since 1952 . and they are indirectly elected by the state legislators of Assam . The number of seats allocated to the party , are determined by the number of seats a party possesses during nomination and the party nominates a member to be voted on . Elections within the state legislatures are held using proportional representation via Single transferable vote .
Question: who votes to elect a rajya sabha memmber
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who votes to elect a Rajya Sabha member based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again.  The context says that the Rajya Sabha is the upper house of Parliament in India. It mentions Assam electing 7 or 6 seats since different years and these are indirectly elected by state legislators of Assam. The number of seats a party gets depends on their presence during nomination and how they nominate members to be voted on. Elections in the state legislatures use proportional representation via Single transferable vote.  Wait but the question is about who votes for Rajya Sabha members. From what I remember in India's parliamentary system the lower house is the Lok Sabha (House of Commons) elected by direct representation and the upper house is the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).   But looking at the context provided it talks specifically about Assam's elections but doesn't mention Lok Sabha or how Rajya Sabha members are elected. The context mentions that seats in Assam are elected indirectly by state legislators which suggests that maybe the state legislature elects Rajya Sabha members? But I thought that Rajya Sabha is directly elected from reservations.  Wait no actually in India Rajya Sabha members are typically elected from State Legislative Councils of states and Union Territories. So each state's Legislative Assembly has members who can stand for election to the Rajya Sabha under the reservation system. So the Lok Sabha members don't elect Rajya Sabha members directly; instead it's the state legislatures.  But in the context provided Assam elects 6 or 7 seats since different years and these are indirectly elected by their own legislators. So maybe each state sends its Legislative Assembly members to vote for Rajya Sabha members from that state. But wait no—Rajya Sabha is directly elected; it's via reservations in the Lok Sabha.  Wait I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: In India the Lok Sabha (L下议院) has members elected by direct representation through general elections. The Rajya Sabha (R上议院) has members who are typically selected from the State Legislative Councils of each state and Union Territories under a reservation system.  So for example in Assam which is an East India state the Rajya Sabha members are elected by the State Assembly or Legislative Council. So when it's said that ""Assam elects 7 seats since 1956 and 6 seats since 1952 and they are indirectly elected by the state legislators of Assam "" does this mean that the state legislatures elect Rajya Sabha members? Or is it that Lok Sabha members don't directly vote for Rajya Sabha members?  But in reality Rajya Sabha members are elected from Lok Sabha candidates through a system called ""Lok Sabha mein Chhatra Abhiyan"" (LSLA) which involves reservation. So Lok Sabha members are the ones who elect Rajya Sabha members.  However looking at the context provided it says that Assam's seats are indirectly elected by state legislators of Assam. So maybe in this specific case Assam's Rajya Sabha members are elected directly by their Legislative Assembly members? That doesn't align with my prior knowledge about how Rajya Sabha works.  Wait perhaps I'm misinterpreting the context. The context might be talking about a different system where state legislatures elect Rajya Sabha members which is not the usual case in India. Normally it's Lok Sabha members who elect Rajya Sabha through LSLA.  But regardless of that confusion based on the given context: ""Assam elects 7 seats since 1956 and 6 seats since 1952 and they are indirectly elected by the state legislators of Assam."" So perhaps in this question it's about how Rajya Sabha members are elected within a state. But usually Rajya Sabha is an upper house so maybe the question is mixing up the levels.  Wait no. The actual question is asking who votes to elect a Rajya Sabha member. In reality Lok Sabha members don't vote directly for Rajya Sabha members; instead each state's Legislative Assembly sends its own members (maybe with reservation) to be considered for Rajya Sabha seats.  But according to the context provided: ""the number of seats allocated to the party are determined by the number of seats a party possesses during nomination and the party nominates a member to be voted on."" This suggests that party strength at nomination determines how many candidates they can field. Then these are elected via Single Transferable Vote in state legislatures.  Wait but the question is about Rajya Sabha voting. The context provided talks more about state elections within Assam and their proportional representation. So perhaps in this specific scenario it's the state legislators who vote for Rajya Sabha members from that state?  But I thought that's not how it works. So maybe the answer based on the given context would be that state legislators of Assam vote for Rajya Sabha members but normally it's Lok Sabha members through LSLA.  I think the key here is to focus strictly on the provided context. The question asks who votes to elect a Rajya Sabha member. From the context: ""Assam elects 7 seats since 1956 and 6 seats since 1952 and they are indirectly elected by the state legislators of Assam."" So perhaps in this case it's the state legislatures' members who vote for Rajya Sabha members from that state. But normally it's Lok Sabha members.  So putting it all together: Based on the context given which is about how Assam elects its own Legislative Assembly members to then possibly allocate seats to Rajya Sabha but perhaps in reality the answer would be that state legislators of various states vote for Rajya Sabha members. But I'm not entirely sure because traditionally it's Lok Sabha.  But according to the context provided the vote is from Assam's state legislators to elect Rajya Sabha members indirectly. So maybe each state sends its Assembly members who then select Rajya Sabha representatives? Or perhaps each state sends a certain number of candidates for Rajya Sabha via their Assembly.  I think I need to clarify: The Rajya Sabha is directly elected by Lok Sabha members through a system called ""Lok Sabha mein Chhatra Abhiyan "" which involves reservation. But the context given seems to suggest that in Assam seats are allocated based on proportional representation from their state legislators implying that each state's Assembly selects their own Rajya Sabha representatives.  Therefore based on the context provided it might be that the state legislators of Assam vote for Rajya Sabha members elected from their state. So maybe the answer is that the state legislators of each respective state elect the Rajya Sabha members from that state.  The state legislators of each respective state vote to elect Rajya Sabha members from their state.", state legislators of each respective state vote to elect rajya sabha members from their state,state legislatures,0,0.11764705882352941,11.077660700000706,0.003928431032658544,0.0011534682382337885,0.0,0.0,0.0

Wait the Qing Dynasty was established by the Manchus right? Their leader was PowerShell. They did expand beyond what existed before them in terms of administration. But when it comes to territory expansion on land I think that wasn't their main focus.  Then there's the Josepha Chen incident. She was a Mandate holder who moved parts of China into Taiwan under the Qing. That must be part of the expansion they did.

Question: what is the second largest country in asia
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out which country has the second-largest area in Asia based on the provided context. Let me start by understanding the data given.  Looking at the table each row lists a country along with its area and some notes. The areas are given in square kilometers (km²). My goal is to find the country with the second largest area after the largest one.  First I should identify which country has the largest area. From what's provided Russia seems to have 17 125 200 km² including its European part. That looks like a huge number. Then China is next at 9 596 961 km² but excludes Hong Kong Macau Taiwan and disputed areas. So Russia is clearly the largest.  Now I need to find the second one. Scanning through the list the next biggest seems to be India with 3 287 263 km². But wait let me check if there's any country between India and Russia in terms of size.  Looking at the table again: after Russia comes China then India followed by Kazakhstan (2 455 034) Saudi Arabia (2 149 690) Iran (1 648 195) and so on. So after Russia the next largest is indeed India.  Wait a second are there any other countries that might be larger than India? Let me check. The table has entries up to Total 44 million km² but each country's area is listed individually. The highest after Russia is clearly China then India and so on.  So the order would be: 1. Russia (17 125 200) 2. India (3 287 263)  Therefore the second largest country in Asia according to this data is India.

Looking through the data:  - The first three entries are all Neil Jenkins scoring 30 29 and 28 points against Italy at different venues in 1999. So that's Wales vs. Italy.   - Next is Gavin Henson with 28 points scored against Japan at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in 2001.

The context given mentions that Murray appeared as a guest star in eight episodes of the first season then joined the main cast in season two and was added to the opening credits.  Wait but who is Mcgee? Oh right Mcgee is one of the main characters on NCIS played by Michael Shanks. So he wasn't just a guest star; he became a regular.  The context says Murray was a guest star in the first season (season 1) then in season 2 he joined the main cast and got added to the opening credits. So that means he started as a regular in season 2.  I think that's it. So Mcgee became a regular on NCIS starting from season two.

Question: when was 1 john 5 7 added to the bible
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out when ""1 John 5:7"" was added to the Bible. Let me start by breaking down the question. The user is asking about a specific biblical passage and its addition into the text.  From the context provided it mentions something called the Comma Johanneum which is found in Latin manuscripts of the First Epistle of John at 5:7-8. It first appeared in Vulgate manuscripts in the 9th century. The earliest Greek manuscript with this comma was from the 15th century.  The context also notes that this comma isn't present in various other translations like Ethiopic Aramaic Syriac Slavic Armenian Georgian and Arabic. Scholarly consensus is that it's a Latin corruption that entered the Greek tradition later on. However the debate is mainly among English-speaking communities due to the King James Only movement.  So putting this together: The comma itself was in Latin manuscripts since the 9th century but didn't appear in other languages until much later or wasn't present at all. The question is about when it was added to the Bible overall not just a specific manuscript.  I think ""added"" here might refer to its inclusion into the English translation of the Bible. If that's the case considering the context mentions the King James Only movement in the English-speaking world which likely influenced when this comma was included. However the exact date isn't directly given for the English Bible but it's known that such alterations happened during certain periods.  Wait actually the Comma Johanneum is a grammatical change and not necessarily an addition of a verse. So maybe the user is asking about when the specific text ""1 John 5:7"" was included in the Bible as we know it today.  But according to the context the comma itself is a modification found in Latin manuscripts starting the 9th century but missing from Greek and other languages. The inclusion of this comma into the Greek tradition happened later around the 15th century. So perhaps ""added"" refers to its presence in the Bible's text.  However the original Bible doesn't contain this comma; it was added through Latin manuscripts. So when was it added? It seems that the earliest evidence is from the 9th century in Latin but it wasn't present in Greek until later. The English translation would have incorporated this over time.  But without specific info on the English Bible's inclusion of the Comma Johanneum perhaps the answer refers to its discovery or recognition rather than actual addition. Since the context doesn't provide a date for the English Bible specifically regarding this comma maybe it's not possible to answer accurately with the given information.  The earliest known appearance of ""1 John 5:7"" as a Latin comma was in Vulgate manuscripts from the 9th century. However specific details about its addition to the English Bible are not provided in the context.

Question: how many hospitals are there in the united states
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out how many hospitals there are in the United States based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.  The context mentions that as of 2018 there were 5 534 registered hospitals in total. It then breaks this down into different types: 4 840 community hospitals and others including non-profit for-profit government-owned etc. However I'm only interested in the total number.  I should look for a direct statement that provides the total number of hospitals. The first sentence directly states: ""As of 2018 there were 5 534 registered hospitals in the United States."" That seems to be the answer right there.  Wait let me make sure I'm not missing anything else.

Question: what is the rate limiting enzyme of kreb's cycle
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which enzyme in the Krebs cycle is the rate-limiting one. From the context provided it seems like several steps are labeled from 0 to 10 with specific reactions and enzymes involved.  Looking through each step:  - Step 3 mentions ""Isocitrate + NAD"" converting to ""Hydration Isocitrate + ..."" so that's isocitrate hydratase. But I don't see it as rate-limiting here.   - Step 6 is labeled as the oxidation stage where succinyl-CoA synthetase acts which leads to ATP production. The description says it's a substrate-level phosphorylation or ADP → ATP.  Wait but another step in the answer provided mentions succinate dehydrogenase at rate 8 and Fumarate + H2O giving L-malate with fumarase. But according to my notes here step 6 is when the rate-limiting enzyme is involved because it's generating ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation or ADP conversion.  Wait maybe I'm mixing up steps. Let me check again. Step 5 mentions α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase which is oxidative decarboxylation and generates NADH. Then step 6 involves succinyl-CoA synthetase for substrate-level phosphorylation generating ATP.  But looking back at the initial answer provided by another user they mentioned that succinate dehydrogenase (step 8) is rate-limiting because it's the slowest enzyme in the cycle and a key regulatory point. However based on my context step 6 seems to be where the actual ATP production happens via substrate-level phosphorylation.  Wait perhaps I need to clarify. The question asks for the rate-limiting enzyme of the Krebs cycle. From biochemistry the TCA cycle's rate-limiting step is when succinate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate and then to L-malate. This step is indeed the slowest point because it requires the proton gradient that the previous steps have built up.  So in the context provided Step 8 describes Fumarate + H2O leading to L-malate with fumarase which is a hydration reaction. But wait the main oxidation enzyme here would be succinate dehydrogenase (step 6?) but according to the initial answer given by another user it's step 8 where Fumarate and ubiquinone produce ubiquinol. Hmm maybe I'm getting confused between steps in different cycles.  Wait no fumarase is for hydration of fumarate back to succinate which is a reverse reaction. The oxidation would be the dehydrogenase enzyme (succinate dehydrogenase) that converts succinate into fumarate and then L-malate with the help of ubiquinone. But in the context provided step 8 says Fumarate + H2O produces L-malate using fumarase as the enzyme. So maybe I'm mixing up steps from different cycles.  Alternatively perhaps the rate-limiting enzyme is succinate dehydrogenase because it's a key regulatory point and also involved in generating ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation (step 6). However another source says that fumarate hydratase (step 9) might be slow if the proton gradient is insufficient.  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me try to list out each step:  - Step 0: Oxaloacetate + Acetyl CoA → Citrate - Step 1: Not listed in the context - Step 2: Not listed in the context; maybe oxaloacetate breakdown? - Step 3: Isocitrate hydratase produces isocitrate and CO2 from cis-Aconitate - Step 4: Aconitase converts isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate with CoA - Step 5: α-KG dehydrogenase oxidizes to oxaloacetate + NADH - Step 6: Oxaloacetate combines with Acetyl CoA and H2O → citrate via Succinyl-CoA synthetase producing ATP (substrate-level) - Step 7: Citrate to Aconitate; but perhaps not relevant here - Step 8: Fumarate hydration to L-malate using fumarase? Or is that a separate step? Wait no in the context step 9 says L-Malate dehydrogenase oxidizes it with NAD+ to Oxaloacetate and NADH.  So perhaps steps 6 and 8 are involved. Step 6 produces ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation (so rate-limiting because it's a major source of ATP) while step 8 might be the oxidation that uses the proton gradient but is not directly producing ATP via SLP.  In standard biochemistry the TCA cycle has four main steps:  1. Citrate synthase: irreversible and rate-limiting in some cases? 2. Isocitrate hydratase 3. α-KG dehydrogenase 4. Succinyl-CoA synthetase (producing ATP via SLP) 5. Fumarate hydratase  Wait but according to the standard cycle the conversion of succinate to fumarate is not enzyme-catalyzed; rather it's a hydration step without an enzyme because it's fast.  The rate-limiting enzyme in the TCA cycle is typically considered to be the enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of succinate to fumarate and then to L-malate. However since fumarate hydratase isn't active unless there's sufficient proton gradient that step might slow down if the previous steps don't build up enough ATP.  Wait no fumarate hydratase is an enzyme (step 9 in context) that converts fumarate to L-malate and regenerates oxaloacetate. But it works under low pH due to malate's stability. However according to the context step 8 shows Fumarate + H2O → L-Malate using Fumarase. Wait no—that can't be right because fumarate is an intermediate in the cycle.  Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The rate-limiting enzyme in the TCA cycle is usually considered to be step 8: Fumarate + H2O → L-Malate using Fumarase but that's hydration and doesn't directly generate ATP. Alternatively it might be step 6 (Succinyl-CoA synthetase) because of substrate-level phosphorylation.  But in the standard cycle the key regulatory point is when succinate is converted to fumarate. However from the context given the answer refers to step 8 as the rate-limiting enzyme due to it being slow and a key regulatory step where FAD acts as a prosthetic group.  Wait no perhaps I'm confusing steps here. The initial answer provided by another user says that succinate dehydrogenase is the rate-limiting enzyme because it's involved in generating NADH and also at a regulatory point for the cycle.  But according to the context step 6 mentions ""Succinyl-CoA synthetase substrate-level phosphorylation or ADP → ATP"" so maybe step 6 is where the actual ATP production happens via SLP. However I'm not sure if that's rate-limiting because it uses a lot of CoA.  Alternatively perhaps fumarate hydratase (step 8) is slow under certain conditions but isn't an enzyme in the cycle—it just hydrates without catalysis.  Wait no according to the context step 8 says Fumarate + H2O produces L-malate with fumarase. But I thought fumarate is converted back to succinate by hydration (fumarase) which would be a forward reaction if it's using ATP? Or maybe it's a separate process.  I'm getting confused between steps in different cycles or processes. Let me try again:  From the context step 6 is where citrate + CoA → oxaloacetate and produces ATP via SLP from NADH.  But according to standard biochemistry the rate-limiting step is when succinate dehydrogenase oxidizes succinate to fumarate and then to L-malate. This might be enzyme step 8 in the context if it's Fumarate hydratase or maybe a different enzyme altogether.  Wait no perhaps I need to look at each enzyme:  - Citrate synthase (step 0) is the first committed enzyme but not rate-limiting. - Isocitrate hydratase (step3) - Aconitase (step4) - α-KG dehydrogenase (step5) - Succinyl-CoA synthetase (step6) produces ATP via SLP - Fumarate hydratase is a hydration step not catalyzed by an enzyme. - L-Malate dehydrogenase (step9) oxidizes to oxaloacetate.  So perhaps the rate-limiting enzyme is_succinate dehydrogenase. But in the context given step8 says fumarate + H2O → L-malate via fumarase which would be a hydration without generating ATP directly but involved after step6.  Alternatively if FUMARATE hydratase is an enzyme that uses H2O to hydrate fumarate back to succinate then it's a reverse reaction. So maybe the rate-limiting step is when fumarate gets converted into L-malate which requires the proton gradient provided by NADH from the previous steps.  Wait but in standard TCA cycle fumarate isn't hydrolyzed; instead it's hydrated back to succinate via fumarate hydratase. So perhaps that step is not enzyme-catalyzed and thus rate-limiting?  But according to the context provided step8 says Fumarate + H2O → L-Malate with fumarase as the enzyme. Hmm maybe I'm missing something here.  Wait no in the actual cycle:  - Succinate dehydrogenase converts succinate into fumarate (oxidation) which is the slowest step because it's where the proton gradient is built up. - Fumarate hydratase then hydrates fumarate back to succinate and donates protons with H+.  But according to the context in step8: Fumarate + H2O → L-Malate using fumarase. Wait that seems off because Fumarate is an intermediate; how does it become L-malate? Maybe I'm misreading the context.  Wait no looking back:  Step 5 says α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (FAD→FADH) and generates NADH equivalent of 2.5 ATP. Then step6: Oxaloacetate + Acetyl CoA → citrate via substrate-level phosphorylation or ADP to ATP.  Wait perhaps I'm mixing up steps. Maybe the rate-limiting enzyme is Fumarate hydratase (step8) which regenerates succinate and contributes to proton gradient but it's a slow step because without enough NADH from previous steps it can't pump protons forward.  But in standard terms the TCA cycle's rate-limiting step is when fumarate is hydrated back to succinate using FUMARATE hydratase. However that would be a proton-consuming step which might not be the slowest because the cycle runs as an anti-parallel process with protons being pumped in during the oxidative steps.  Wait no actually the TCA cycle has fumarate produced at step 6 (Succinyl-CoA synthetase) and then passed to step8 (Fumarate hydratase). So Fumarate hydratase is a reverse hydration that uses H2O to form L-malate. But I think this is not accurate because fumarate shouldn't convert back to L-malate directly; it should stay as fumarate and be converted into succinate again.  Wait maybe in the context provided FUMARATE hydratase is step8 converting fumarate back to oxaloacetate? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. Alternatively if fumarate is being hydrated to L-malate via fumarase that would imply it's a forward step into the cycle.  I think I need to stick with standard knowledge here. The rate-limiting enzyme in the Krebs cycle is succinate dehydrogenase because it oxidizes succinate to fumarate and then to L-malate which is crucial for regenerating NAD+ and building up the proton gradient for oxidative phosphorylation.  But according to the context provided step8 mentions Fumarate + H2O → L-Malate using fumarase. So maybe in this case the rate-limiting enzyme is fumarase because it's slow under certain conditions like low ATP levels or high malate concentration (due to buffering).  Alternatively if step6 involves succinyl-CoA synthetase for SLP production that might be the rate-limiting enzyme as it produces ATP.  Wait no in standard TCA cycle steps:  1. Citrate synthase: irreversible but not rate-limiting. 2. Isocitrate hydratase 3. Aconitase 4. α-KG dehydrogenase 5. Succinyl-CoA synthetase (produces ATP via SLP) 6. Fumarate hydratase  So step5 is where the first ATP production occurs but it's also a key point for regenerating NAD+.  Wait no actually in standard steps:  - Citrate to isocitrate (step3) - Isocitrate to α-KG (step4) - α-KG to oxaloacetate (step5) and NADH - Oxaloacetate combines with Acetyl CoA (step0) to make citrate again.  Wait this is confusing. Let me outline the actual steps:  The TCA cycle typically has the following main reactions in order:  1. Citrate synthase: Citrate + CoA → Isocitrate 2. Isocitrate hydratase: Isocitrate → α-Ketoglutarate + CO2 (but in some cases maybe isocitrate to oxaloacetate) Wait no the actual cycle:  1. Isocitrate hydratase converts cis-isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. 2. Aconitase: α-ketoglutarate → 3-phosphoglycerate and CO2 (but in reality it's more like transferring CoA). Wait maybe I'm mixing up steps.  Let me look again at the context provided:  Step0: Oxaloacetate + Acetyl-CoA → Citrate Step1: Not listed but perhaps oxaloacetate breakdown. Step3: Isocitrate hydratase converts isocitrate to oxaloacetate (but that seems off) Wait no—step3 says ""Isocitrate + NAD"" becomes ""Hydration Isocitrate + ..."" so maybe it's converting isocitrate to something else.  I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach: the rate-limiting enzyme in the TCA cycle is generally considered to be the enzyme that performs the oxidation of succinate which would correspond to step6 or fumarate hydratase (step8) if it's the slowest step due to insufficient proton gradient.  But according to standard biochemistry the TCA cycle steps are as follows:  1. Citrate synthase: irreversible rate-limiting at a lower ATP level. 2. Isocitrate hydratase 3. α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (FAD-dependent) 4. Succinyl-CoA synthetase (substrate-level phosphorylation) 5. Fumarate hydratase  In this case step6 would be where ATP is produced via substrate-level phosphorylation making that the rate-limiting enzyme.  But in the context provided step8 mentions fumarate and L-malate with fumarase as the enzyme. So perhaps that's a separate step or not part of the cycle.  Wait no maybe I'm mixing up steps from different cycles. The correct answer according to standard TCA is succinate dehydrogenase which in the context might be step8 if FUMARATE hydratase is involved. But fumarate shouldn't directly convert to L-malate; that's probably a mistake.  Alternatively perhaps in this context step6 is where ATP production occurs via SLP from NADH making succinyl-CoA synthetase the rate-limiting enzyme as it's involved in producing the majority of ATP in the cycle at that point.  But I'm not sure. Given all this confusion I think the correct answer according to standard TCA is that the rate-limiting enzyme is succinate dehydrogenase (which might correspond to step8 or another step depending on context) but in the provided context it's likely fumarate hydratase.  Wait no maybe the rate-limiting enzyme is Oxaloacetate carboxyltransferase I which is citrate synthase. But that doesn't produce ATP directly. Alternatively if step6 produces ATP via SLP then that might be rate-limiting.  I think after all this confusion the correct answer according to standard TCA is that the rate-limiting enzyme is succinate dehydrogenase because it's where the main proton gradient is built up for oxidative phosphorylation.  The provided context describes a series of enzymatic reactions in the TCA (Tricarboxylic Acid) cycle leading from oxaloacetate through various intermediates back to citrate. Among these steps the rate-limiting enzyme is identified as **succinate dehydrogenase** because it catalyzes the oxidation of succinate into fumarate and subsequently into L-malate a key step in regenerating NAD+ and establishing the proton gradient necessary for oxidative phosphorylation.  In the context given Step 6 involves **succinyl-CoA synthetase** which generates ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP). However standard biochemistry recognizes **succinate dehydrogenase** as the enzyme responsible for the slow rate-limiting step of converting succinate into fumarate and contributing to the proton gradient.

Question: who won the gold for the men's figure skating
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who won the gold medal for men's figure skating in the US. Hmm wait a second isn't the US not usually involved in international competitions? They don't have an Olympic team because they're part of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico right? So maybe they can't participate or get medals.  But I'm not 100% sure about that. Let me think again. The USA does participate in some sports like skiing and gymnastics through their state Olympic teams but figure skating isn't one of them. Figure skating is typically associated with countries that have their own national teams like Canada for ice dance or the Netherlands for singles滑冰. So maybe the US didn't send any athletes to figure skating events at the Olympics.  Wait are there any US figure skaters? I know some from TV shows but do they compete internationally? I think they might represent Canada because their names and skills match those of Canadian skaters. So if a US citizen is representing Canada then obviously they don't have an official team in the US for figure skating.  So putting it all together since the US doesn't have its own figure skating team at the Olympics there's no US athlete competing.

It is very difficult to remove the authority of the Chief Election Commissioner once elected by the president , as two - thirds of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha need to vote against him for disorderly conduct or improper actions .
Question: chief election commissioner of india can be removed by whom
Answer: ",Okay so I have this question about how the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) of India can be removed. Let me try to figure this out based on what's given in the context.  The context says that the CEC is a high-ranking official who is part of the Election Commission. It mentions that the CEC is usually from the Indian Civil Service specifically the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). That tells me they are selected through civil service exams or similar processes.  Next it explains how the CEC is removed: two-thirds of both the Lok Sabha (which is the lower house of parliament) and Rajya Sabha (the upper house) need to vote against him for disorderly conduct or improper actions. So removing a CEC isn't easy because it requires significant legislative action from both houses.  Wait does that mean you can remove the CEC by two-thirds majorities in both parliaments? That seems like a very difficult process. I don't recall any recent information where the CEC has been removed under these conditions. So practically speaking it's not commonly done because it requires such a high threshold of disapproval.  So putting that together the answer should be that the Chief Election Commissioner can be removed by two-thirds majorities in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for disorderly conduct or improper actions.

Question: where was the film manchester by the sea filmed
Answer: ",Okay I need to figure out where the movie Manchester by the Sea was filmed based on the context provided. Let me look through the given information step by step.  First the context mentions that it's a 2016 American drama film directed by Kenneth Lonergan and stars several actors. The plot involves a man after his brother dies and caring for his nephew. It premiered at Sundance in January 2016 and was picked up by Amazon later.  Then looking into the filming locations: it says it was filmed in the Massachusetts town of the same name as the film as well as Beverly Essex Gloucester Swampscott Lynn Middleton Tewksbury and Salem. So the primary location is Manchester Massachusetts. The other towns listed are additional filming locations but the main place where most of the movie was filmed would be Manchester itself.  The context also mentions that it began limited release on November 18 2016 and wide release on December 16 2016. It grossed $77 million worldwide with a budget of $8.5 million. But these details are about the release and box office performance not where it was filmed.  So to answer the question: Where was Manchester by the Sea filmed? The context explicitly states that filming took place in Manchester Massachusetts as well as other nearby towns like Beverly Essex etc. but primarily in Manchester.  The film Manchester by the Sea was primarily filmed in Manchester Massachusetts., film manchester by sea was primarily filmed in manchester massachusetts,Manchester,0,0.18181818181818182,2.584233599991421,0.0008963184842605937,0.0002631775623248698,0.0,0.0,0.0

Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who has access to the presidential daily briefing based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The first sentence says that while the PDB (presidential daily brief) implies exclusivity it's been given to other high-ranking officials historically. The distribution list has varied over time but usually includes Secretaries of State and Defense as well as the National Security Advisor. Sometimes special editions might be only for the President's eyes but that's rare.  So putting this together the main recipients are the Secretaries of State Defense and National Security Advisor.

Context: Indoor toilets were at first a luxury of the rich and only gradually spread to the lower classes . As late as the 1890s , building regulations in London did not require working - class housing to have indoor toilets ; into the early 20th century , some English homes were built with an upstairs toilet for use by the owners and an outhouse for use by the servants . In some cases , there was a transitional stage where toilets were built into the house but accessible only from the outside . After World War I , all new housing in London and its suburbs had indoor toilets .
Question: when did indoor toilets become common in america
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when indoor toilets became common in America. The context provided talks about indoor toilets gradually becoming more available starting from the late 19th century with the upper class getting them first. By the early 20th century some English homes had upstairs toilets for owners and outhouses for servants which were only accessible from the outside. After World War I all new housing in London got indoor toilets.  But wait this context is about England not America. So how does that relate to when indoor toilets became common in the USA? The question is specifically about America so I can't rely on the English context alone. I should think about historical facts related to the USA's adoption of indoor toilets.  I know that in the United States the availability of indoor plumbing has been a gradual process due to various factors like societal changes public health campaigns and technological advancements. In the late 19th century many homes still didn't have indoor toilets because of the cost and practicality issues at the time.  However by the early 20th century with the help of innovations in plumbing and public health education more Americans started getting indoor toilets installed. The World War I period might not be directly applicable here since the war was on the other side but it's possible that similar infrastructure improvements happened post-war especially after they served during the conflict.  Looking into specific dates I remember that by the 1930s and 40s many cities had started requiring indoor plumbing. For example New York City began enforcing indoor sanitation regulations in the mid-20th century. By the 1960s it became a more common feature.  Wait but when exactly did indoor toilets become widespread? I think in the early to mid-20th century after World War I there was an increase in government regulation and public health campaigns promoting better sanitation which led to more widespread installation of indoor toilets. So by 1936 after the end of World War I indoor plumbing became more common but it wasn't until later that it became widespread across America.  But when exactly? Some sources say that by the early 20th century many homes in the US had indoor toilets. Wait no that's from England again. For the USA it might be a bit later. Maybe around the mid-20th century?  Wait I'm getting confused because the context given is about London and England so maybe I need to think beyond that. Let me recall: in the United States the first indoor toilet was installed by Dr. Samuel G. Badger in Boston in 1896. That's an example of a specific case but when did it become common?  By the early 20th century many cities had public restrooms with indoor facilities but individual homes might not have been fully equipped until later. The widespread installation probably started around the 1930s to 1940s as part of housing developments and public health initiatives.  So putting it all together I think that by the early to mid-20th century specifically perhaps in the 1930s or 1940s indoor toilets became common in America.  Indoor toilets became common in America during the early to mid-20th century with significant changes starting around the 1930s and 1940s due to infrastructure improvements public health campaigns and housing developments.,indoor toilets became common in america during early to mid20th century with significant changes starting around 1930s and 1940s due to infrastructure improvements public health campaigns and housing developments,After World War I,0,0.0,5.7263300999911735,0.002014698902719903,0.0005915570808224658,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what is the revolution period of venus in earth years
Answer: ","Okay so I need to find out the revolution period of Venus in Earth years based on the provided context. Let me look through the context again to find the relevant information.  I see a section titled ""Orbital characteristics"" which likely contains the necessary data. Scanning through that part I come across several lines mentioning different aspects like aphelion perihelion semi-major axis eccentricity orbital period etc.  Looking specifically at the line: ""Orbital period 7007194141664000000 ♠ 224.701 d 6999615198000000000 ♠ 0.615 198 yr"". Oh that's the orbital period given in two different units: days and Earth years.  So the orbital period of Venus is approximately 224.701 days. To convert this into Earth years I can divide by the number of days in an Earth year. But wait from another source I remember that one Earth year is about 365.25 days. However since the context already provides it as 0.615 Earth years I think I can directly use that value.  Therefore Venus's revolution period around the Sun is approximately 0.615 Earth years.  The revolution period of Venus is approximately 0.615 Earth years.", revolution period of venus is approximately 0615 earth years,224.7 Earth days,0,0.16666666666666666,2.8222188000072492,0.000980051412363163,0.0002877632740906342,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who has the power to approve or veto legislation constitution
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who has the power to approve or veto legislation under U.S. constitutional law. The context provided is about the Philippine government's process but that might not directly apply here since it's about the U.S. system.  I remember that in the U.S. Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. They have the power to make laws through Article I of the Constitution. But the President plays a role too—he can veto legislation. However he doesn't always do that; sometimes he signs it into law instead.  Wait there's something about a two-thirds majority needing to override a veto. So if Congress wants to undo a president's veto both houses need to pass the bill again with a two-thirds vote each. That makes sense because each house has its own power over the other.  Also in case of a tie or when the President refuses to sign altogether Congress can act through this two-thirds process. I think that's how it works—so the President only overrides legislation if Congress decides to do so by passing it with their respective majorities.  So putting it all together: The power to approve or veto comes from Congress and the President. The President can veto a bill proposed by Congress but Congress can override his veto by taking action through their own legislative process.  The power to approve or veto legislation lies in Congress under U.S. constitutional law. The President can veto a bill (but not indefinitely) while Congress can override this via a two-thirds vote in both chambers when the bill reoriginates., power to approve or veto legislation lies in congress under us constitutional law president can veto bill but not indefinitely while congress can override this via twothirds vote in both chambers when bill reoriginates,the President,0,0.05714285714285715,2.733016599988332,0.0009442617620622221,0.000277254695847454,0.0,0.0,0.0

A terminus ante quem for A Shrew seems to be August 1592 , as a stage direction at 3.21 mentions `` Simon , '' which probably refers to the actor Simon Jewell , who was buried on 21 August 1592 . Furthermore , The Shrew must have been written earlier than 1593 , as Anthony Chute 's Beauty Dishonoured , written under the title of Shore 's wife ( published in June 1593 ) contains the line `` He calls his Kate , and she must come and kiss him . '' This must refer to The Shrew , as there is no corresponding `` kissing scene '' in A Shrew . There are also verbal similarities between both Shrew plays and the anonymous play A Knack to Know a Knave ( first performed at The Rose on 10 June 1592 ) . Knack features several passages common to both A Shrew and The Shrew , but it also borrows several passages unique to The Shrew . This suggests The Shrew was on stage prior to June 1592 .
Question: when was the taming ofthe shrew first performed
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when ""The Taming of the Shrew"" was first performed. Let me go through the context provided step by step.  First the context mentions that a terminus ante quem (a date before which something happened) for A Shrew seems to be August 1592 because Simon Jewell's burial was on that date and referred to as ""Simon."" That suggests that A Shrew was written or first performed around then.  Then it talks about another play Anthony Chute's ""Beauty Dishonoured "" published in June 1593. It contains a line that refers to The Shrew specifically the part with ""He calls his Kate and she must come and kiss him."" Since this line is from The Shrew but not present in A Shrew it means that The Shrew was written before 1593 because Chute's play came out later.  Additionally there are similarities between The Shrew A Shrew and another anonymous play called ""A Knack to Know a Knave "" which was first performed at The Rose on June 1592. This play shares some passages with both A Shrew and The Shrew but also has unique parts for The Shrew. The presence of these shared passages suggests that The Shrew was already being performed before June 1592.  Putting it all together the earliest possible date from the context is August 1592 when Simon Jewell died making that a likely time when A Shrew was first performed or at least nearing completion. However since ""A Knack to Know a Knave"" was already performed in June 1592 and The Shrew borrows from it it's possible that The Shrew was first performed before this date.

Context: In 2012 , a graphic adaptation of the Book of Esther was illustrated by J.T. Waldman and appeared in volume one of The Graphic Canon , edited by Russ Kick and published by Seven Stories Press .
Question: where do the events in the story take place geographically
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out where the events in ""The Book of Esther"" take place based on the provided context. Let me break this down step by step.  First the context mentions that a graphic adaptation was illustrated by J.T. Waldman and appeared in volume one of ""The Graphic Canon."" It also notes that it was published by Seven Stories Press in 2012. Hmm but where exactly did the events take place? I don't see any geographical information here.  I know that Esther is part of the Bible specifically the Book of Esther which is in the Hebrew Bible or Chumash in Yiddish. The original text likely takes place in ancient Israel around the time when the Israelites were in exile under King Xerxes I from 538 to 451 BCE.  Wait but does that information come from somewhere else? If the context doesn't mention any specific locations or geography beyond the graphic adaptation details maybe it's not provided. So perhaps I should look for clues within the given text.  The question is asking about geographical places where the events take place. The only thing in the context related to publication and editing. No specific places like cities or countries are mentioned. So without additional information from the context I can't determine the exact locations.  Maybe I need to think outside the provided context? Like common settings for such stories. Esther's story involves the Persian Empire specifically Persia under Xerxes I. So the events probably take place in modern-day Iran or Iraq during that time period.  But since the question is based on the given context which doesn't mention any geographical details maybe the answer isn't provided there. In that case perhaps it's inferred from the Bible setting.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the movie ""Last Man on Earth"" was filmed based on the given context. The context provided says that the main recording location is a 20th Century Fox studio in Chatsworth California.  Hmm wait a second. Let me make sure I understand this correctly. The context mentions the main recording location for the series is the Fox studio in Chatsworth. Does that mean all filming took place there? Or was it just for the series?  I know ""Last Man on Earth"" is based on a book by Thomas Pynchon which deals with historical events and alternate realities. So I'm guessing they needed to film different scenes set in various historical periods or maybe even alternate timeframes.  But if the context only mentions Chatsworth as the main location does that mean most of the filming happened there? Or was some done elsewhere too?  I should check my knowledge on the movie's filming locations. From what I recall ""Last Man on Earth"" was made in 1997. It stars Tommy Lee Jones and includes scenes set during the Vietnam War the Cold War and other historical events.  Given that it's possible that a lot of filming took place at the 20th Century Fox studio in Chatsworth because it might have been used for scenes requiring controlled environments or specific setups like outdoor scenes.  But then again they probably had to film scenes in real locations too. For example maybe parts of California or other places were used as sets. However the context provided only mentions Chatsworth as the main location.  So based solely on that context I should answer that they filmed at the 20th Century Fox studio in Chatsworth California.

Minority government Party won the election , but prime minister lost own seat The Interpretation Act of 1967 states that `` where an appointment is made effective or terminates on a specified day , that appointment is considered to be effective or to terminate after the end of the previous day . '' Under the Act , Prime Ministers ' tenures are therefore credited as having concluded at the end of their last full day in office ( the earlier date given ) , although their resignation was received by the Governor General on the following day . This provision applies to Trudeau in 1979 and 1984 , Clark , Turner , Mulroney , Campbell , Chrétien , Martin , and Harper .
Question: who was the 11th prime minister of canada
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the 11th Prime Minister of Canada was based on the provided information. Let me start by scanning through each entry to find the one where the Prime Minister's term is labeled as 11th.  Looking at each person:  - The first few are listed with their years and terms but I'm looking for the 11th term.   - Pierre Trudeau is mentioned in multiple entries. Let me check his details.  In the section about Pierre Trudeau it says he was the Prime Minister from April 20 1968 to June 3/4 1979. That's his second term because his first term was from July 25 1945 to January 29 1958.  Wait let me confirm the timeline:  - Pierre Trudeau was Prime Minister in multiple terms. His first term was 1945-1958 (term number one). His next term started in 1968 which would be his third term overall? Or is each election cycle a term?  Actually Canada's Prime Ministers are elected every four years so each consecutive PM is a new term. So Pierre Trudeau was the first PM from 1932-1945 (term one) then he wasn't again until 1968 when he became Prime Minister again for his third term.  Wait no looking back at the information:  In the entry about Pierre Trudeau it says he served in Parl 't 27 and 28. That's part of the Progressive Conservative Party which I believe was his first term as PM starting in 1968.  So let me break down each Prime Minister's terms based on their election years:  - Pierre Trudeau: First term (1945-1958) then re-elected for a second term from 1968-1979 which would be his third term overall. Wait but the user is asking for the 11th Prime Minister.  Wait maybe I'm miscounting because each election cycle after Pierre Trudeau's first term adds to his terms as PM. Let me list all the PMs in order:  1. John A. Macdonald (1867-1890) 2. Simon Bolivar (1890-1891) 3. David Thompson (1891-1895) 4. James A. Garfield (1895-1896) – but he died so his term ended in 1896 Wait no actually the timeline provided doesn't list all the early PMs; it starts from Pierre Trudeau onward.  But since the user is asking for the 11th Prime Minister and based on the information given Pierre Trudeau's third term would be his first as a returning PM after a gap. Wait maybe I need to count each time they were PM regardless of gaps.  Looking at the list:  - Pierre Trudeau was PM three times: terms one (1945-1958) then again from 1968-1979 (term two) and then later? Or did he become PM twice?  Wait let me go step by step through each entry.  Looking at the list:  Each entry corresponds to a Prime Minister with their term in brackets. So Pierre Trudeau is listed multiple times because he was PM three separate terms: first from 1945-1958 (term one) then from 1968-1979 (term two since there was a gap between 1958 and 1968) and later again?  Wait no actually in the provided information Pierre Trudeau is listed under different terms. Let me check:  - Pierre Trudeau's first term: 1945-1958 - Then he returned in 1968 as PM for his second term (1968-1979) - Later did he serve again? Looking through the list I don't see him listed after that. So maybe he was PM three times.  Wait no let me check each entry:  - The first few entries are before Pierre Trudeau's first term: John Diefenbaker in 1979? No looking back the earliest in the provided data is Pierre Trudeau starting from 1968. So perhaps he was PM three times.  Wait but I need to find who was the 11th Prime Minister. Let me count based on the list given:  Looking at each entry and assigning term numbers as per their order:  - The first few are before Pierre Trudeau's first term: For example Brian Mulroney is listed under 2004 so that would be his first term.  Wait no let me parse each Prime Minister with their terms based on the information given. Since the timeline starts from Pierre Trudeau onward perhaps all the others are after him.  Wait but actually in the list provided:  - Pierre Trudeau is mentioned starting at Parl 't 27 (1968) then later at Parl 't 32 (1980)  So let's count each PM based on their term order:  Looking through all entries and counting each Prime Minister as a separate term:  1. John A. Macdonald - 1st But wait the data provided starts with Pierre Trudeau in 1968 so maybe it's better to list them from the earliest given.  Wait no perhaps the user is only providing information starting from Pierre Trudeau onward but that can't be because the first entry is Pierre Trudeau. Wait no looking at the data:  The entries start with Pierre Trudeau as PM in 1968? No wait: The very first entry under Pierre Trudeau starts in April 20 1968.  Wait let me parse each section properly.  Looking through all the sections:  - The first entry is about John Diefenbaker (1979) but actually no—wait looking at the data provided it's a table with various PMs and their terms. Each row lists details for a Prime Minister.  Wait perhaps I should go through each row and note who was PM in which term:  - Pierre Trudeau: April 20 1968 – June 3/4 1979 (two terms: PM1) Then later he is listed again at Parl 't 37 for a third term? Wait no.  Wait looking through each entry:  Pierre Trudeau appears twice in the list. First as PM from 1968-1979 (this would be his first time as PM after returning). Then again later in Parl 't 32 at June 4 1993 – March 2/3 1994? Wait no:  Wait the entry says: Pierre Trudeau is appointed at Parl 't 37. His term starts on November 4 1993.  Wait let me parse each section step by step.  Looking through all sections:  - Brian Mulroney was PM until June 24/25 1993 (term one) - Kim Campbell was PM starting June 25 1993 – November 3/4 1993 (term two; this is her first term as she's the first female PM) - Jean Chrétien served from November 4 1993 – December 11/12 2003 (term three) - Paul Martin was PM until February 5/6 2006 (term four) - Stephen Harper: March 3 2006 – November 3/4 2008; then again from November 4 2008? Wait no.  Wait the entries may be split across different paragraphs. Let me try to parse each section correctly:  1. Pierre Trudeau's first term: April 20 1968 – June 3/4 1979 (term one) 2. Then later in Parl 't 37: November 4 1993 – March 5 1994? Wait no the entry says ""June 4 1993"" but perhaps it's a different term.  Wait I'm getting confused because each section is split across years. Let me try to assign term numbers based on the order in which they were PM:  - Pierre Trudeau was PM from 1968 (term one) Then again later: November 4 1993 – December 11/12 2003 (term two) Wait no let me check each entry carefully.  Looking through all entries assigned to Pierre Trudeau:  - First term: April 20 1968 – June 3/4 1979 - Then again at Parl 't 32: March 3 1980 (start) – September 16 1984 (end) Wait so that would be his second term. Then later in Parl 't 35: November 4 1993 – March 3/4 2003? Wait the entry says he was appointed in Parl 't 37 starting on June 4 1993.  Wait perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all Pierre Trudeau's terms:  - Term one: April 20 1968 – June 3/4 1979 (first term as PM) - Term two: March 3 1980 – September 16 1984 - Term three: November 4 1993 – December 11/12 2003  Wait that would make him the third PM in his own party.  So if we're counting all Prime Ministers regardless of party:  Looking through each entry and assigning term numbers based on their order as a Prime Minister.  But perhaps it's better to approach this by counting each time someone was PM from the start of the timeline provided. Let me list them in chronological order:  1. Brian Mulroney: 2004 Wait no looking at the data it starts with Pierre Trudeau in 1968.  Wait I'm getting too confused because the information is split across different years and paragraphs.  Alternative approach: Since each entry assigns a term to a Prime Minister starting from April 20 1968 (Pierre Trudeau) perhaps all subsequent PMs are after that. So the first PM in this dataset is Pierre Trudeau as term one.  So counting:  1. Pierre Trudeau (April 1968) Then later: - He was re-elected at Parl 't 32: March 3 1980 – September 16 1984 That would be his second term. Wait no the entry says he's reappointed in Parl 't 37 on June 4 1993. Wait I'm getting confused.  Alternatively perhaps each time Pierre Trudeau is listed corresponds to a new term: first term (1968-1979) then again later as his second term (term two) and maybe third.  But since the user wants the 11th Prime Minister let's count all PMs in order based on their terms:  Looking at each section:  Pierre Trudeau is listed three times with different terms. Each time he was PM so that would be multiple terms for him.  Wait but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the 11th Prime Minister according to this data is Brian Mulroney as his first term ending in June 2004? No Brian Mulroney served until November 3/4 1993 (his first term) then he was PM again later?  Wait no in the provided information:  Brian Mulroney: PM from 1980-1993 Kim Campbell: 1993-1993? No she started after Brian. Then Jean Chrétien: Nov 1993 – Dec 2003 (two terms) Paul Martin: until Feb 2006 Stephen Harper: March 3 2006 – November 4 2008 Wait no Stephen Harper was PM for two terms?  Wait it's getting too tangled. Maybe a better approach is to note that Pierre Trudeau served as the third Prime Minister in this list:  - First term: 1968 (PM one) - Second term: March 3 1980 (PM two) - Third term: November 4 1993 (PM three)  So if he was PM three times then his third term would be the 11th? No that doesn't make sense because there are multiple other PMs in between.  Wait I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to list all the PMs from Pierre Trudeau onwards and count their terms:  Looking through each section:  Pierre Trudeau: - First term: April 20 1968 – June 3/4 1979 (PM one) Later in Parl 't 32: - Term two: March 3 1980 – September 16 1984 Later again in Parl 't 35: - Term three: November 4 1993 – March 3/4 2003? Or is it December 11 2003?  Wait no the entry says ""November 4 1993 - December 11/12 2003""  So Pierre Trudeau served three terms: PM one (1968-79) PM two (1980-84) and PM three (1993-03). So that's three separate terms as the same party.  But if we're counting each Prime Minister as a separate individual then Pierre Trudeau is only one person. Therefore his multiple terms don't count towards the 11th PM; they just represent different periods in his term.  So perhaps I need to list all the unique Prime Ministers from this dataset and count them:  Looking through each entry:  - Brian Mulroney (2004) - Kim Campbell (1993) - Jean Chrétien (2003) - Paul Martin (2006) - Stephen Harper (2008)  Wait but according to the data provided Pierre Trudeau is the only Prime Minister listed multiple times with different terms.  But if we consider all unique PMs in this dataset starting from Pierre Trudeau onwards:  1. Pierre Trudeau (PM one: 1968-79) Then re-elected as PM two: March 3 1980 – September 16 1984 Then again later as PM three: November 4 1993 – December 11/12 2003  But that doesn't help because we need the 11th Prime Minister. Alternatively perhaps this data is insufficient to determine the 11th PM.  Wait no actually looking at each entry:  In the section about Brian Mulroney: he was PM until 1993 Kim Campbell served from 1993-1993? No she started in June 25 1993 and ended on November 3/4 1993. So that's her first term.  Then Jean Chrétien was PM until December 11/12 2003 (two terms: his first as PM starting Nov 4 1993)  Paul Martin served until February 5/6 2006 Stephen Harper served from March 3 2006 – November 4 2008  So if we count each Prime Minister's terms:  1. Pierre Trudeau (PM one: Apr 1968–Jun 1979) 2. Brian Mulroney (PM two: Jun 1980–Nov 1993) – but wait the entry says Brian Mulroney was PM from July 25 1980 to November 4 1993?  Wait let's parse each section carefully.  Looking at all sections:  - Pierre Trudeau: first term Apr 1968–Jun 1979 - Then again in Parl 't 32: March 3 1980 – September 16 1984 (his second term) Then again later in Parl 't 35: November 4 1993 – December 11/12 2003 (third term)  But these are all under the same party so Pierre Trudeau was PM three times.  Next:  - Brian Mulroney was PM until November 4 1993 - Then Jean Chrétien served from Nov 4 1993 – Dec 11/12 2003 (two terms) - Paul Martin: Feb 5 2006 onwards? Wait the entry says Paul Martin was PM until February 5/6 2006  Then Stephen Harper served from March 3 2006 – Nov 4 2008  So if we list all unique Prime Ministers:  1. Pierre Trudeau (terms: Apr 1968–Jun 1979) 2. Brian Mulroney (Jul 1980–Nov 1993) Wait no according to the data Brian Mulroney served from July 25 1980 – November 4 1993? Or June 16 1980?  Looking back:  In the entry about Brian Mulroney: ""From July 25 1980"" to ""November 4 1993""  Then Jean Chrétien started on November 4 1993  So in order:  - Pierre Trudeau (Apr 68–Jun79) - Brian Mulroney (Jul80–Nov93) – that's term one for him But wait the entry says ""until Nov 4 1993""  Wait no Brian Mulroney was PM from July 25 1980 until November 4 1993  Jean Chrétien started on November 4 1993 and served until December 11/12 2003 (two terms)  Paul Martin: Feb 5 2006 – ?  Stephen Harper: March 3 2006 – Nov 4 2008  So counting each unique PM:  1. Pierre Trudeau (terms: Apr '68–Jun '79) Then Brian Mulroney (Jul '80–Nov '93) Jean Chrétien (Nov '93–Dec '03) – that's his first term Paul Martin (Feb '06 onwards?) Stephen Harper (Mar '06–Nov '08)  But if we're counting the number of Prime Ministers it would be:  1. Pierre Trudeau 2. Brian Mulroney 3. Jean Chrétien 4. Paul Martin 5. Stephen Harper  That's five.  So to get up to 11 perhaps there are more PMs in this dataset who served multiple terms or others were involved?  Wait looking back at the data:  In the section about Brian Mulroney: ""From July 25 1980 until November 4 1993""  Jean Chrétien's term starts on Nov 4 1993  Then in the section about Jean Chrétien: ""From November 4 to December 11/12""  So he served two terms.  Similarly Paul Martin was PM from Feb 5 2006 onwards until the end of his term  Stephen Harper started on March 3 2006  Wait no according to the data:  ""From March 3 2006 – November 4 2008""  Then later: ""From February 5/6 2006 until Nov 1993?"" No that's not consistent.  I'm getting confused again. Maybe I should approach this by counting the number of unique Prime Ministers listed in each section:  - Pierre Trudeau (appears multiple times with different terms) - Brian Mulroney: once - Jean Chrétien: appears twice (two terms) - Paul Martin: once - Stephen Harper: once  So total unique PMs here are: Pierre Trudeau Brian Mulroney Jean Chrétien Paul Martin Stephen Harper.  That's five. So if we need the 11th Prime Minister in this dataset perhaps it refers to someone else not listed here or requires more context.  Alternatively maybe I miscounted and there are more PMs when considering all their terms.  But given the data provided it seems only five unique PMs: Pierre Trudeau Brian Mulroney Jean Chrétien Paul Martin Stephen Harper. Unless I missed someone else.  Wait no in the section about Brian Mulroney he served until November 4 1993 and then Jean Chrétien started on Nov 4 so that's one term for each.  So Pierre Trudeau: three terms Brian Mulroney: one term Jean Chrétien: two terms (totaling three) Paul Martin: one term Stephen Harper: one term  Total terms count:  Pierre:3 + Brian:1 + Jean:2 + Paul:1 + Stephen:1 = 8 terms meaning there are eight different Prime Ministers if counting each term as a separate PM.  Wait but that can't be because the same person (Pierre Trudeau) served multiple times. So Pierre Trudeau is one PM with three terms.  So perhaps the count of unique PMs:  1. Pierre Trudeau 2. Brian Mulroney 3. Jean Chrétien 4. Paul Martin 5. Stephen Harper  Total five unique PMs in this dataset.  If we're to find the 11th Prime Minister but there are only five listed here perhaps it's beyond this data or requires a different approach.  Wait I think I'm overcomplicating again. The user provided specific information about certain PMs and their terms. So let's list them in order:  Looking at all sections:  - From Apr 68 to Jun '79: Pierre Trudeau (PM one) Then later: - From Jul '80 to Nov '93: Brian Mulroney (PM two) From Nov '93 to Dec '03: Jean Chrétien (two terms PM three and four) From Feb '06 onwards: Paul Martin (PM five) From Mar '06 to Nov '08: Stephen Harper (PM six)  So up to November 2004:  1. Pierre Trudeau 2. Brian Mulroney 3. Jean Chrétien 4. Paul Martin 5. Stephen Harper  That's five but the user wants the 11th.  Wait perhaps I'm missing some information in the dataset that refers to more PMs.  Looking again at each section:  In the section about Brian Mulroney: he was PM from Jul '80 – Nov '93 Jean Chrétien served from Nov '93 until Dec '03  Then Paul Martin started on Feb '06 and served until ?  Stephen Harper started March '06–Nov '08  But according to the data it doesn't specify their end dates beyond that.  So if we count each unique PM as one:  1. Pierre Trudeau 2. Brian Mulroney 3. Jean Chrétien 4. Paul Martin 5. Stephen Harper  Only five.  Therefore based on this dataset there isn't an 11th Prime Minister listed; the highest is five. So perhaps the user made a mistake or provided insufficient data.  But if I have to answer based on what's given it seems that within this information the 5th PM would be Stephen Harper. But the question asks for the 11th which isn't present here.  Alternatively maybe I'm missing something else in the dataset.  Wait looking at each section:  - Brian Mulroney: served until Nov '93 - Jean Chrétien started on Nov '93 and served until Dec '03  So that's two terms for Jean Chrétien  Then Paul Martin from Feb '06 onwards which is his first term  Stephen Harper from Mar '06–Nov '08: his first term  Therefore unique PMs:  1. Pierre Trudeau 2. Brian Mulroney (1st) 3. Jean Chrétien (1st and 2nd terms) 4. Paul Martin (1st) 5. Stephen Harper (1st)  So again five.  Unless there's more data elsewhere in the dataset that I'm not seeing but based on what is provided perhaps the answer is Brian Mulroney as the first PM after Pierre Trudeau? Or maybe I've miscounted.  Wait no the user wants to know who was the 11th Prime Minister according to this information. Since only five are listed here there's no 11th. Therefore based on the provided data it's impossible to determine the 11th PM as not enough information is given.  According to the provided information the list of Prime Ministers does not reach an 11th individual due to insufficient data. The unique Prime Ministers listed are:  1. Pierre Trudeau (three terms) 2. Brian Mulroney 3. Jean Chrétien (two terms) 4. Paul Martin 5. Stephen Harper  Therefore based on the given dataset there is no 11th Prime Minister.  Answer: There is insufficient information to determine the 11th Prime Minister as only five unique individuals are listed in the provided dataset.",there is insufficient information to determine 11th prime minister as only five unique individuals are listed in provided dataset,R.

Question: where did saudi crown prince go to college
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the Saudi Crown Prince went to college based on the context provided. The context given is about Charles Tupoutoʻa ʻUlukalala. Hmm that name doesn't ring a bell immediately. Wait is this related to Prince Charles of Saudi Arabia? Maybe his twin brother?  So if it's Prince Charles then I should consider his educational background. From what I remember some monarchs have attended prestigious universities like Oxford or Harvard. But wait did Prince Charles attend Oxford? Let me think. Yes he studied at the University of Oxford. But was that for a specific field? I believe he studied law there.  So putting it all together the Saudi Crown Prince likely went to the University of Oxford to study law. That makes sense given his educational path as reported by various sources.

Question: the very last episode of that's so raven
Answer: ","Alright let me try to figure out the answer. The user provided a list of episodes with titles and some details numbered from 79 onwards up to 102. They're asking for the very last episode of ""That's So Raven.""   First I need to look through each episode number to find which one is the last in the series. Looking at the numbers: the highest number listed is 102 but it doesn't say when it was aired. However from what I know about the show the finale was usually an episode with a title ending with 'The Finale' or something similar.  Looking through the list I don't see any episode titled ""The Last Episode"" or ""The Finale."" The last entry is 102: ""Where There's Smoke "" but that might be another part of the series. Wait in the provided list after number 96 there are some numbers like 100 and 102 listed with different dates. However I also see an episode numbered 79 as the first one which is ""That's So Raven."" Then it goes up to 102.  But in reality ""That's So Raven"" ended with an episode titled ""The Last Episode "" but since the user provided a list that stops at number 102 I need to check if that's the case. Looking through the dates and titles the last episodes in the list are:  - 98: Teacher's Pet - 99: The Way We Were (which is noted as the series finale but didn't air until later) - 100: Where There's Smoke - 102: The next one which isn't numbered beyond that.  Wait in the list after episode 96 the numbers continue to 100 and then presumably up to more. But since the user only provided up to number 102 I can infer that ""The Last Episode"" would be the last entry before the series concluded. However looking through the provided data there's no explicit ""Last Episode "" but perhaps ""Where There's Smoke"" is considered part of the finale.  Wait in the data episode 97: The Dress is Always Greener Then 98: Teacher's Pet 99: The Way We Were (finsihal) 100: Where There's Smoke And then probably more after that. But since the user only provided up to 22 November 2007 perhaps ""Where There's Smoke"" is the last episode in the list given.  But actually according to standard knowledge ""That's So Raven"" ended with ""The Last Episode "" but if this list stops at 102 without that title then maybe it's not included here. However looking at the user's list the highest number is 102. But I think in reality the last episode was ""The Last Episode "" which isn't listed here because they only went up to 102.  Wait checking again: The list goes from 79 upwards with multiple entries beyond that but perhaps in this provided data it's missing. So maybe the answer is ""Where There's Smoke"" as the last episode in the given list but if considering the actual finale it would be different.  But since I have to go by what's in the user's provided data which goes up to 102 without a title indicating that perhaps they expect ""The Last Episode "" but since it's missing here maybe ""Where There's Smoke"" is considered part of the series. Alternatively it might be an oversight.  Wait actually looking at the list again: episode 97 is The Dress is Always Greener 98: Teacher's Pet 99: The Way We Were (finsihal) 100: Where There's Smoke  But then there are more after that beyond number 22. So perhaps ""The Last Episode"" wasn't listed but the user provided up to November 2007. Maybe the last episode is indeed ""Where There's Smoke "" which might be the final one in this list.  Alternatively maybe ""That's So Raven"" ended with an episode titled ""The Last Episode "" which isn't included here because it wasn't part of their provided data. However since I have to answer based on what they provided perhaps the last listed is 102: Where There's Smoke.  The very last episode of ""That's So Raven"" in the provided list is:  **102.

Question: who is the lead singer of depeche mode
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the lead singer of Depeche Mode is. From the context provided it mentions that David Gahan is the baritone lead singer. He's been part of the band since 1980 and has also released solo albums like ""Paper Monsters"" in 2003 and ""Hourglass"" in 2007.  Wait but sometimes bands have multiple members or have lineups change over time. I should make sure that David Gahan is still the lead singer as of now. The context says he's known as the baritone lead singer since their debut so it seems consistent. He's been part of Depeche Mode for a long time and even has solo work which shows his prominence.  I don't recall any changes to the main lineup in recent years so it's safe to assume that David Gahan is still the lead singer today.

I know that the United States made its Olympic debut in both the Summer and Winter Olympics in 2014. Similarly Great Britain was a new participant as well.  Additionally I think North Korea also participated for the first time during that Winter Games. They have historically been part of the Paralympics but not the main Olympics until recently.  So putting it together: the US Great Britain and North Korea all made their Olympic debuts in 2014.  The United States Great Britain and North Korea participated for the first time in the 2014 Winter Olympics.

Context: A pop and R&B ballad , the subjects of `` Best Thing I Never Had '' are revenge and karma . Not wanting to feel broken - hearted , the female protagonist sings that she feels happy to have left her lover , who did not recognize the potential for a happy life with her . Some critics viewed it as a sequel to Beyoncé 's 2006 single `` Irreplaceable '' as the two songs are thematically similar . However , some lyrics , including `` showed your ass '' and `` sucks to be you right now '' , were criticized . The ballad was also likened to Vanessa Carlton 's 2002 single `` A Thousand Miles '' ( 2002 ) .
Question: what is best thing i never had song about
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what the song ""The Best Thing I Never Had"" is about based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that it's a pop and R&B ballad. The subjects of the song are revenge and karma. That gives me a couple of key themes right off the bat: revenge karma.  Then it talks about the female protagonist feeling happy she left her lover because he didn't recognize their potential for a happy life together. So that's more about betrayal or maybe not being reciprocated. The song is about how leaving someone who didn't see your worth was satisfying.  The context also notes some critics saw it as a sequel to Beyoncé's ""Irreplaceable "" which I know deals with confidence and self-worth but here the focus seems different on revenge rather than confidence. It mentions specific lyrics like ""showed your ass"" and ""sucks to be you right now "" which might imply a confrontational tone.  Additionally it's compared to Vanessa Carlton's ""A Thousand Miles "" which is about overcoming loneliness or traveling through life experiences. So maybe this song also deals with personal growth or letting go of something that no longer serves you.  Putting it all together: The themes are revenge and karma focusing on leaving someone who didn't recognize your worth leading to happiness and the idea that the best thing one never had is a chance missed due to such situations. The lyrics point towards a confrontational and self-affirming message about letting go of past relationships or situations that don't serve you anymore.  ""The Best Thing I Never Had"" explores themes of revenge and karma focusing on a woman who finds happiness in leaving a lover she knew wasn't deserving of her potential. The song conveys a sense of relief and self-affirmation suggesting that the best thing one might never have is an opportunity missed due to betrayal or past relationships not serving them well. The confrontational tone highlights letting go of situations that no longer benefit the individual.

505,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: This nerve can cause an electric shock - like sensation by striking the medial epicondyle of the humerus from posteriorly , or inferiorly with the elbow flexed . The ulnar nerve is trapped between the bone and the overlying skin at this point . This is commonly referred to as bumping one 's `` funny bone '' . This name is thought to be a pun , based on the sound resemblance between the name of the bone of the upper arm , the `` humerus '' and the word `` humorous '' . Alternatively , according to the Oxford English Dictionary it may refer to `` the peculiar sensation experienced when it is struck '' .
Question: striking the funny bone is actually compression of the
Answer: ","Alright so I'm trying to figure out what ""striking the funny bone"" refers to in this context. The user provided some context about the ulnar nerve and a bit of history on why it's called that way. Let me break this down.  First the question is asking where the pain or electric shock sensation comes from when you strike the medial epicondyle of the humerus. The term ""funny bone"" must be related to an anatomical structure here. From what I remember the funny bone in anatomy refers to the ribcage specifically the clavicles and vertebrae that can vibrate. But wait the context mentions the ulnar nerve being trapped between the bone and overlying skin at this point.  The medial epicondyle of the humerus is part of the elbow joint—it's a bump on the inside of the elbow. When you strike it from the posterior or inferior side while the elbow is flexed that could cause pressure on the ulnar nerve. So ""striking the funny bone"" in this context isn't about the ribcage but rather an area near the elbow.  Putting it all together since the question mentions compression of something when struck and the medial epicondyle is where the strike happens that must be the location being compressed. The ulnar nerve is getting squeezed there because of the strike on this part of the humerus.  The answer is:  Striking the medial epicondyle of the humerus compresses the ulnar nerve.",striking medial epicondyle of humerus compresses ulnar nerve,The ulnar nerve,0,0.4,2.742368899998837,0.0009399308709861751,0.0002759830570537624,0.0,0.0,0.0

These are followed by the branches off the aortic arch , namely the brachiocephalic artery , the left common carotid , and the left subclavian arteries .
Question: what is the name of the main artery which takes blood from the heart to the body
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out the answer to this question. The question is asking for the name of the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the body. Let me go through the provided context step by step.  The context talks about the aorta being the root systemic artery. It mentions that in humans it receives blood directly from the left ventricle via the aortic valve. Then as the aorta branches and these arteries branch further they become smaller down to arterioles. Arterioles supply capillaries which then connect to venules.  The context also specifically mentions that the first branches of the aorta are the coronary arteries which supply blood to the heart muscle itself. After that come the branches off the aortic arch: the brachiocephalic artery the left common carotid and the left subclavian arteries.  Wait so the main artery taking blood from the heart is the aorta? Because it's called the root systemic artery. So the answer should be ""aorta.""

Context: The Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) was a public work relief program that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed , unmarried men . Originally for young men ages 18 -- 25 , it was eventually expanded to ages 17 -- 28 . Robert Fechner was the first director of the agency , succeeded by James McEntee following Fechner 's death . The CCC was a major part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal that provided unskilled manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of natural resources in rural lands owned by federal , state , and local governments . The CCC was designed to provide jobs for young men and to relieve families who had difficulty finding jobs during the Great Depression in the United States . Maximum enrollment at any one time was 300,000 . Through the course of its nine years in operation , 3 million young men participated in the CCC , which provided them with shelter , clothing , and food , together with a wage of $30 ( about $570 in 2017 ) per month ( $25 of which had to be sent home to their families ) .
Question: what was the goal of the civilian conservation corps
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the goal of the Civilian Conservation Corps based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context mentions that the CCC was part of President Roosevelt's New Deal and focused on providing jobs for young men during the Great Depression. It specifically aimed to offer unskilled manual labor jobs in conservation and development of natural resources. Additionally it helped families by offering shelter clothing food and a wage of $30 per month (about $570 in 2017) with part of that going back home.  So the main goal seems to be providing employment through conservation work for young men while also assisting families.  The goal of the Civilian Conservation Corps was to provide jobs for young men during the Great Depression and assist families by offering shelter clothing food and a wage of $30 per month (about $570 in 2017) with part of that income sent back home., goal of civilian conservation corps was to provide jobs for young men during great depression and assist families by offering shelter clothing food and wage of 30 per month about 570 in 2017 with part of that income sent back home,to provide jobs for young men and to relieve families who had difficulty finding jobs during the Great Depression in the United States,0,0.3870967741935484,1.8578516999987187,0.0006304392555425089,0.00018510994627590955,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: where is most of the worlds gold held
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where most of the world's gold is held based on the provided context. Let me look at the data given.   First I see a list ranked by countries and organizations with their gold holdings in tonnes and their share of forex reserves. The top country isn't immediately obvious from just looking at the rank because some have high shares but maybe not the highest total.  Looking at the first few ranks: the United States holds 8 133.5 tonnes which is a significant amount over 70% of their forex reserves. Germany has around 3 373.6 tonnes about 71%. Then Italy and France follow with slightly lower amounts but still notable.  But then I see Russia holding only about 18% of their forex yet they have nearly 2 000 tonnes. China is next with just over a thousand which seems low compared to others like the Netherlands or Turkey.   Wait the European Central Bank (ECB) holds around 504.8 tonnes at 28.7% and Saudi Arabia has about 322.9 tonnes but only 2.8%. The United Kingdom is next with 310.3 tonnes but only 8.6% of their reserves.  Looking further down I see countries like Spain and Portugal holding a decent amount each but nothing that stands out as the highest after the U.S. Germany Italy France and maybe Russia. The numbers don't add up to a country with an overwhelmingly large share; instead it's spread across several nations.  So putting it all together while the U.S. Germany Italy and France each hold significant amounts of gold none single-handedly dominate the majority. Therefore most of the world's gold is held by these top four countries combined.  Most of the world's gold is held by the United States Germany Italy and France together.,most of worlds gold is held by united states germany italy and france together,United States,0,0.25,3.434719299999415,0.0011952578755780718,0.00035095232282723236,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: animals that are active at dawn and dusk
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out which animals are active during dawn and dusk based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by mentioning that many familiar mammal species are crepuscular. Crepuscular means they are active during the early morning hours (dawn) and late afternoon or evening (dusk). It then lists some specific animals like bats hamsters housecats stray dogs rabbits ferrets guinea pigs and rats.  Then it goes on to say that other crepuscular mammals include jaguars ocelots bobcats strepsirrhines red pandas bears deer moose sitatunga capybaras chinchillas the common mouse skunks Australian wombats wallabies quolls possums and marsupial gliders tenrecidae spotted hyenas and African wild dogs.

Question: what's the name of the last mission impossible movie
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out the name of the last Mission Impossible movie. I remember that the series has several sequels each featuring Ethan Hunt and Luther Stickell. The first one was called ""Mission Impossible"" released in 2006. Then there were a couple more.  I think after ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" which came out in 2015 they did another one. Wait wasn't it called ""Fallout""? I believe that's right because I remember some of the plot points where Ethan and Luther went to a theme park for some mission. Then the next one was supposed to be something else.  Oh yeah after Fallout came ""Ghost Protocol"" in 2018. That involved more high-tech stuff. But now I'm trying to recall if there's another one after that. Did they do a direct sequel or maybe another spin-off?  Wait actually after ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol "" which was released in 2018 they did ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" and then ""Fallout."" So the next would be number five. But I'm not sure if there's a sixth yet.  I think ""Fallout"" is the last one confirmed so far because it's sometimes referred to as MI:5. So putting that together the last movie in the series might be ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout "" released in 2011.

Question: who invented the chip in. debit cards
Answer: ",Alright so I need to figure out who invented the chip in debit cards based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context talks about several people and companies involved in the development of smart cards. It mentions Jürgen Dethloff filing a patent for an automated chip card in 1968 and 1969 which was later granted as USP 4105156 in 1978. Then there's Michel Ugon from Honeywell Bull who invented the first microprocessor smart card with two chips: one microprocessor and one memory. He patented the self-programmable one-chip microcomputer (SPOM) in 1978.  Wait so Jürgen Dethloff is mentioned as inventing the chip for automated chip cards around 1968-69 while Michel Ugon created the first smart card with two chips in 1977. But the question specifically asks about debit cards. I'm not sure if any of these are directly related to debit cards or if it's a different application.  Looking back at the context it also mentions that in 2006 Axalto and Gemplus merged becoming Gemalto which is now the world's top smart card manufacturers. But there's no mention of debit cards specifically being invented by anyone from this period onwards.  I don't recall any specific details about the invention of a chip for debit cards beyond what's in the context provided. The context seems to focus more on the general development of smart cards not specifically debit cards. Since it doesn't provide information on when or who invented the chip used in debit cards I can't find an answer from this source.  Perhaps the user expects me to infer that since Jürgen Dethloth was involved with smart cards in general maybe he also contributed to debit cards? But without explicit mention it's not accurate. So based on the given context there isn't enough information to determine who invented the chip for debit cards.

Question: who picks the chief justice of the illinois supreme court
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who picks the chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that the Supreme Court of Illinois is the state's highest court and it's governed by Article VI of their Constitution. They have seven justices elected from five appellate judicial districts: three from the First District (Cook County) and one each from the other four districts. Each justice serves a ten-year term and the chief justice is elected by the court from its members for a three-year term.  Wait so I'm trying to find out who picks the chief justice. The context mentions that the chief justice is elected by the court from its members. That means it's not an external election like a state assembly or something; instead the other justices vote for the chief justice.  So putting that together since each of the seven justices serves ten years and the chief is selected by the group the people who pick them are presumably the other justices on the bench. Therefore the answer should be that the members of the Illinois Supreme Court (excluding the chief justice) elect the chief justice.  The chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court is elected by the other justices from its seven-member bench.

Question: who began the age of exploration in portugal
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who started the age of exploration in Portugal. Hmm I remember that Portugal was involved in European exploration during the Age of Discovery. But I'm not exactly sure who specifically led it.  I think there were some key figures like Vasco da Gama and Luís de Camões. Wait wasn't Vasco da Gama the one who reached India via the Red Sea? That's right he was the first European to reach the Indian subcontinent since Columbus. But was he the one who started the exploration in Portugal?  I think Luís de Camões came later. He was involved too but maybe after Vasco. So Vasco da Gama is often credited with starting the Age of Exploration because his successful arrival in India led to European interest in other parts of the world.  But I'm not entirely sure if there were others before him. Maybe there were explorers from other countries as well like Spain or France but in terms of Portugal specifically Vasco da Gama seems to be the key figure.  Vasco da Gama began the Age of Exploration in Portugal by reaching India via the Red Sea in 1498 leading European interest in global exploration.

Question: how can you remove the defect of vision presbyopia
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out how to remove the defect of vision called presbyopia. From what I remember presbyopia is related to difficulty focusing on nearby objects as we age. The user provided a context that mentions ""presbys"" from Greek meaning old man and ""opos"" meaning sight which relates to an old man's eyesight issues.  I think the main cause of presbyopia is the eye becoming less accommodating over time especially after the 40s or 50s. The ciliary muscles can't adjust their tension as effectively anymore so they can't focus on close objects as well. So what are the common treatments?  I know that reading glasses help for near work because they provide a slight focusing power to aid in seeing up close without straining the eyes too much. Spectacles which are just another term for contact lenses or eyewear with built-in lenses can offer similar benefits.  Another treatment is bifocal lenses. These have two different focal points: one for distance vision and another for close work. That way you don't have to switch glasses depending on what you're doing.  Laser eye surgery might be an option too. I've heard of something calledLASIK which can reshape the cornea to improve vision without needing bulky eyewear or reading glasses. It's a more invasive procedure but could provide clearer vision for both near and distant objects.  Lastly there are intraocular lenses (IOLs) which are artificial lenses placed inside the eye during surgery. They're generally used for cataract removal but can sometimes be adjusted to help with presbyopia as well.  So putting that all together there are multiple methods: glasses contact lenses bifocals laser procedures and IOLs each offering different solutions depending on individual needs.  To address presbyopia consider these options:  1. **Reading Glasses or Spectacles**: Ideal for those needing to focus on close work without strain.  2. **Bifocal Lenses**: Combines distance and magnification capabilities in one pair of glasses.  3. **Laser Eye Surgery (LASIK)**: A less invasive method to reshape the cornea enhancing both near and distant vision clarity.  4. **Intraocular Lenses (IOLs)**: Often used for cataract surgery but can be tailored to aid with presbyopia when necessary.

Question: who won the fifth season of america's got talent
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who won the fifth season of America's Got Talent. The question is pretty straightforward but let me make sure I get all the details right from the context provided.  First looking at the context it mentions that the fifth season premiered on June 1 2010 on both NBC and Global channels. That's just background about when the show started not necessarily who won.  Next in terms of contestants Michael Grimm was named the winner on September 15 2010. He beat Jackie Evancho a 10-year-old classical singer. So that seems like a key point—the winner is Michael Grimm.  Wait but I also notice that after four seasons David Hasselhoff left to host another show and was replaced by Howie Mandel. That's more about the judges or contestants who might have been part of later seasons not related to the fifth season directly. So probably doesn't affect the winner of the fifth season.

Question: what type of weather does south carolina have
Answer: ",Okay I need to answer the question about the types of weather South Carolina has based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context mentions that South Carolina has a humid subtropical climate. That's the first thing it describes. Then it talks about precipitation levels—between 40 and 80 inches annually which is around 1 000 to 2 000 millimeters.  Next it breaks down how this precipitation happens: tropical cyclones and afternoon thunderstorms contribute during the summer and sometimes in fall months. Extratropical cyclones are responsible for precipitation during other seasons—fall winter spring. Then there's a mention of tornadoes mostly occurring in spring with a secondary peak in November. Hail and damaging winds often happen in summer thunderstorms but are very uncommon unless it's tropical.  So putting this together the main climate type is humid subtropical.

Context: For most of its history , up until independence , the country was known as Santo Domingo -- the name of its present capital and patron saint , Saint Dominic -- and continued to be commonly known as such in English until the early 20th century . The residents were called Dominicanos ( Dominicans ) , which is the adjective form of `` Domingo '' , and the revolutionaries named their newly independent country La República Dominicana .
Question: how did the dominican republic get its name
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out why the Dominican Republic got its name. The context provided mentions that until independence it was called Santo Domingo which is also the name of its capital and patron saint Saint Dominic. It says that in English it was commonly known as such until the early 20th century.  Wait so before becoming the Dominican Republic it was just Santo Domingo. But then how did it get the name Dominican Republic? Let me think about historical names. Often new countries take their name from places where their people originated or significant figures.  In this case the residents were called Dominicanos or Dominicans derived from ""Domingo "" which is the adjective form of ""Dominic."" So perhaps when the country gained independence it adopted a name reflecting its people's origin. Santo Domingo means ""Holy Domino"" in Spanish I believe because it combines Santo (saint) and Domingo.  So maybe after gaining independence they called themselves the Republic of Santo Domingo or something similar. But why did they change it to Dominican Republic? Maybe because ""Santo Domingo"" was too long or perhaps a shorter version was preferred. Alternatively the name might have been shortened over time.  Wait another thought: The Dominican Republic is named after St. Dominic who founded the Dominicans. So maybe when they became independent they took on his name to signify their link to the religious order and their origin as a people from Santo Domingo.  So putting it all together the Dominican Republic got its name either by shortening Santo Domingo or using St. Dominic's name possibly reflecting their faith and origins.  The Dominican Republic obtained its name through a combination of historical naming conventions and its connection to St. Dominic who founded the Dominicans. After gaining independence from Spain in 1821 the country adopted the shorter form ""Dominican Republic"" as a way to simplify the previous name ""Santo Domingo."" This change reflected both their origins in Santo Domingo and their association with St. Dominic thereby adopting a concise and symbolic name that encapsulates their religious identity.

Question: what is the rank of india in economic growth
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out India's ranking in economic growth based on the provided context. Let me go through the data step by step.  First looking at the context there are several sections with different rankings and stats about India. The question specifically asks about the rank of India in economic growth.  I remember seeing a section labeled ""GDP growth rate."" Under that I see two entries: one from the CIA World Factbook 2016 with an estimated growth rate of 6.8% which is ranked position 12. Then there's another entry also from the same source but in 2017 (I think) listing the GDP growth rate as 3.45 trillion but that doesn't seem to be a ranking number—maybe it's nominal GDP rather than growth rate.  Wait no looking closer I see ""GDP growth rate"" with two entries: position 12 at 6.8% and another entry for ""Nominal GDP."" So the rank is probably under the GDP growth rate section.  In that section the first item is ranked number 12 with a growth rate of 6.8%. Since the question is about the rank not the growth rate itself I think India's ranking in economic growth (probably GDP growth) is position 12.

Question: new anime from the creators of attack on titan
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out a new anime from the creators of ""Attack on Titan."" From the context given the creators involved are Tetsurō Araki and Masashi Koizuka. Looking at the table ""Attack on Titan"" is from 2013 onwards ongoing. Now I should check if any other series by these creators have a release date after that.  Checking each entry:  - Hozuki's Coolheadedness (Hiro Kaburaki) ended in 2015. - The Rolling Girls and Seraph of the End both came out in 2015. - Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress in 2016. - The Ancient Magus' Bride in 2018 which is ongoing? Wait no—the context says 2017–2018 for ""The Ancient Magus' Bride "" but it's TV Series with a TBA status. So maybe it's still ongoing or not released yet. - After the Rain came out in 2018 as well.  So none of their other works are new beyond what's already ongoing except for possibly ""Attack on Titan"" itself since it's listed as ongoing from 2013 onwards. But the question is about a new one so maybe they have another project?  Looking at ""Vinland Saga "" which is TBA. It's by Makoto Yukimura not Araki or Koizuka so that doesn't count.

Context: The system of reservation in India comprises a series of action measures , such as reserving access to seats in the various legislatures , to government jobs , and to enrollment in higher educational institutions . The societal inequality in India is represented by the grossly inadequate representation of Scheduled Castes , Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Castes in employment and education due to historic , societal and cultural reasons . The reservation nourishes the historically disadvantaged castes and tribes , listed as Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes by the Government of India . The reservation is undertaken to address the historic oppression , inequality and discrimination faced by those communities and to give these communities a place . It is intended to realize the promise of equality enshrined in the Constitution . However , there has been a serious debate about reservation .
Question: why is there a provision of reservation of seats in the legislature
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out why there's a provision for reserving seats in the legislature based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again.  The system of reservation in India includes measures like reserving seats in legislatures government jobs and higher education. The societal inequality is because Scheduled Castes Tribes etc. aren't adequately represented in employment or education due to long-standing issues. Reservation aims to give historically disadvantaged groups a chance by providing them with reserved seats.  So the question is about why reservations for seats in the legislature exist. From the context it's clear that this is part of a broader system designed to address historical oppression and discrimination against these communities. The goal is to promote equality as per the Constitution. There's also mention of debate around this system but I'm focusing on the reason for the provision itself.  I think the main points are: historical oppression inequality in employment/education cultural reasons and the intention to provide a place through reservations. So putting it together the purpose is to give these historically disadvantaged groups representation in government and legal bodies to promote equality.  The provision of reservation for seats in the legislature exists to address historical oppression systemic inequalities and cultural injustices faced by Scheduled Castes Tribes and other backward classes. It aims to provide them with a platform in governance and uphold the constitutional promise of equality.

Question: the first significant restriction on free immigration in u.s. history was the
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the first significant restriction on free immigration in U.S. history based on the provided context. The context talks about President Obama's executive actions in 2014 that delayed deportation for millions of illegal immigrants specifically targeting parents of U.S. citizens and young people brought in illegally.  Hmm I know from general knowledge that there have been several policies restricting immigration over the years but I'm trying to recall the first major one. I think it's the late 19th or early 20th century. The context here mentions Obama's actions which are more recent so they can't be the answer.  Wait wasn't there a law called the Smoot-Hawley Tariff? No that was related to tariffs and trade restrictions not immigration. Oh right I think it was the 1924 Smoot-Hawley Tariff but that's about taxes on imported goods not people.  Then there's the Chinese Exclusion Act. Yes that rings a bell. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 or so. It prohibited Chinese immigrants from coming to the U.S. I think it was in 1882 and later expanded in 1902. This act limited immigration based on nationality which is a significant restriction.  So putting it together the first major restriction would be the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. It set up a system where certain Asian immigrants were prohibited from entering the U.S. which was a big deal at the time and influenced many subsequent policies.  The first significant restriction on free immigration in U.S. history was the **Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882** which prohibited Chinese immigrants from entering the United States until 1902., first significant restriction on free immigration in us history was chinese exclusion act of 1882 which prohibited chinese immigrants from entering united states until 1902,Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882,0,0.33333333333333337,2.9704788999952143,0.0010381588733273592,0.00030482482107196203,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who sang what condition my condition is in
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who sang ""Condition My Condition"" based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions several films and shows where the song is featured: - It's featured in a dream sequence from the Coen Brothers' 1998 film The Big Lebowski. - Played during end credits of the 2000 video game Driver 2 title screen and end credits of the 2013 video game Stick It To The Man. - Featured in the 2010 action movie Faster. - Also used in season 3 episode 1 of Chuck: ""Chuck Versus the Pink Slip."" - A short clip heard in the 2015 HBO documentary Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief. - It's also on the TV series Fargo season 2 episode 7.  Hmm none of these references mention who sang the song. The question is asking specifically about ""Condition My Condition."" I'm trying to remember if this song is one that stands out in my mind as a particular artist's track. I think it might be from a lesser-known band or maybe a lesser-known song. Since the context doesn't provide direct information perhaps I need to deduce based on any possible clues.  Wait ""Condition My Condition"" sounds familiar. I think it might be by a band called The Smashing Pumpkins? Or was it another band? Let me try to recall any instances where this song has been used or mentioned in relation to music or media. Alternatively maybe it's a song by a more obscure artist.  Alternatively perhaps the answer is that there isn't enough information provided here; sometimes songs are licensed without the artists being credited directly in these contexts. So if none of the sources mention who sang it then the answer might be unknown based on this context.  Wait but I'm supposed to provide an answer from the given context. Since none of the context mentions the artist perhaps the safest answer is that the information isn't available here. Alternatively maybe it's by a popular band like The Coen Brothers' reference? No The Coen Brothers are filmmakers not musicians.  Alternatively could ""Condition My Condition"" be from a song by a more well-known artist that I'm not recalling correctly? Maybe The National or something else? Without any specific mention in the context it's hard to say. So perhaps the answer is that the information isn't provided in the given text.

Question: where was the salvation army's christmas collection kettle first introduced
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the Salvation Army's Christmas collection kettle was first introduced. The context provided mentions that Captain Joseph McFee started this tradition in San Francisco. He remembered a sight from his days as a sailor in Liverpool England called ""Simpson's Pot "" which had donations poured into it by passersby. McFee then brought the idea to San Francisco and placed a crab pot and tripod at the Oakland ferry landing.  Wait the question is specifically about where the kettle was first introduced. From the context McFee used a crab pot in Oakland. But he originally saw Simpson's Pot on the Stage Landing in Liverpool. I think the key here is that the tradition started with Simpson's Pot in England and then moved to San Francisco by McFee.  But looking back at the question: it asks where the kettle was first introduced. The context says Captain McFee ""brought the idea"" of a pot collection to San Francisco but he got the concept from Liverpool. So technically Simpson's Pot in Liverpool is where the tradition originated and then the crab pot with the kettle was brought to San Francisco by McFee.  So the answer should be that the kettle was first introduced in San Francisco right? Wait no—the original pot was in Liverpool. But since the question is about the Salvation Army's kettle being introduced which started with McFee's efforts in San Francisco even though it's based on a previous idea from Liverpool.  Wait the context says Captain McFee ""resolving to provide a free Christmas dinner"" and remembered Simpson's Pot in Liverpool. He then brought this idea to San Francisco by placing a crab pot at the ferry landing. So the kettle was introduced in San Francisco as part of the Salvation Army's efforts but it was based on an existing concept from Liverpool.  But the question is where the kettle was first introduced for the Salvation Army tradition. Since McFee introduced it in San Francisco even though he borrowed the idea from Liverpool's Simpson's Pot which was originally in England.  So I think the answer is San Francisco.  The Salvation Army's Christmas collection kettle was first introduced in San Francisco by Captain Joseph McFee in 1891 drawing inspiration from a similar pot in Liverpool.", salvation armys christmas collection kettle was first introduced in san francisco by captain joseph mcfee in 1891 drawing inspiration from similar pot in liverpool,in San Francisco,0,0.2222222222222222,3.674286400011624,0.0012875860228524776,0.00037806176791883346,0.0,0.0,0.0

Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out the meaning of AUV in cars based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that in Australia and New Zealand SUV isn't commonly used except by motoring organizations press and industry bodies. Instead off-road vehicles are called four-wheel drives (4WDs) 4X4s or XUVs. Some manufacturers refer to their products as SUVs but others use terms like XUV such as Avalanche XUV from HSV or GMC Envoy XUV or AUVs.  Wait so in this context the term ""AUV"" is mentioned alongside ""XUV."" It says things like Avalanche XUV and GMC Envoy XUV. So that would mean AUV stands for Action Utility Vehicle? The context also mentions that sometimes manufacturers use SUV as a marketing term for four-wheel drives but also refers to them as AUVs.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who sings the song ""The Whiskey Ain't Workin'."" Alright from the context provided it's mentioned that it's a song recorded by American country music artists Travis Tritt and Marty Stuart. It was released in November 1991 as the third single from Tritt's album ""It's All About to Change.""   Wait but then the question is asking who sings ""The Whiskey Ain't Workin' Again."" Hmm maybe I misread that earlier time. Let me check again. The context says it was released in November 1991 as the third single from Tritt's album. So perhaps ""The Whiskey Ain't Workin' Again"" is a different song? Or maybe it's a mix-up.  Looking back the first sentence clearly states that both Travis Tritt and Marty Stuart sang ""The Whiskey Ain't Workin'."" Then there's another mention of ""The Whiskey Ain't Workin' Again "" which might be referring to a cover or a different version. But in the context given it only talks about one song being their third single. So maybe I should stick with that.  Wait no looking again: The first line says it was released as the third single from Tritt's album so ""The Whiskey Ain't Workin'."" Then later it mentions ""The Whiskey Ain't Workin' Again"" in the context of a song by another artist. Hmm maybe I need to be careful here.  Wait no the initial answer provided was Travis Tritt and Marty Stuart for the first song but then in the second mention they refer to another song: The Whiskey Ain't Workin' Again by Eric Johnson & The Instincts. So perhaps there are two songs with similar titles?  So putting it all together ""The Whiskey Ain't Workin'"" is by Travis Tritt and Marty Stuart while ""The Whiskey Ain't Workin' Again"" was another song released in 1984 as the third single from Eric Johnson & The Instincts.   But since the question is about ""The Whiskey Ain't Workin' "" I think that's the one by Travis Tritt and Marty Stuart as per the initial context. Maybe the user got confused with the similar-sounding title of another song.  So to answer directly: Travis Tritt and Marty Stuart sang ""The Whiskey Ain't Workin'"" in 1991.

The temperature at the inner core 's surface is approximately 5,700 K ( 5,430 ° C ) , which is about the temperature at the surface of the Sun .
Question: what is the thickness of earth's inner core
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out the thickness of Earth's inner core. Let me start by reading through the provided context again carefully.  The context says that the Earth's inner core has a radius of about 1 220 kilometers which is roughly 70% of the Moon's radius. It's mostly made of iron-nickel alloy and some other elements. The temperature at its surface is around 5 700 K or 5 430°C similar to the Sun's surface.  Wait but the question is about the thickness not just the radius. Hmm so I might need to think about whether ""radius"" here refers to half the diameter. Because when we talk about the size of a sphere like the Earth or its inner core the radius is half of its diameter. So if the radius is given as 1 220 km then the diameter would be twice that.  Let me calculate that: 1 220 km multiplied by 2 equals 2 440 kilometers. That should give me the total thickness or diameter of the inner core.   I don't think I need any additional information from the context because it's directly providing the radius necessary to compute the diameter. The other details like composition and temperature are probably just extra context but not needed for answering the question about thickness.  So putting it all together the thickness of Earth's inner core is twice its radius which is 2 440 kilometers.

So I can't directly access that site which means I have to think about other ways to find this information.  First I remember that ""I Want to Rock and Roll"" is a pretty well-known song. It was covered by several artists over the years. The most famous version comes from The Rolling Stones right? They had a hit with it in the 70s. But wait were there other versions too?  Let me think... There's also a version by Black Sabbath. They did a cover that's pretty recognizable with their riff and drumming style. Then there's Deep Purple as well; I think they have a song called ""Smoke on the Water "" but maybe it's similar? Or was that another song?  Oh wait! One of my friends mentioned that The Guess Who sang it earlier in the 70s before The Rolling Stones took over. That makes sense because many songs have multiple versions with different artists.

Looking back it says Arsenal are one of six teams to have won the Premier League since its formation in 1992 with the others being Manchester United Blackburn Rovers Chelsea Manchester City and Leicester City.

Question: the first element on the periodic table is
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what the first element on the periodic table is. From what I remember the periodic table starts with hydrogen which has an atomic number of 1. Let me make sure that's correct.  The context provided mentions all elements from atomic numbers 1 to 118 have been discovered or synthesized including some recent additions confirmed in 2015 and 2016. It specifically names the first seven rows as complete with these elements.   So hydrogen is element number 1 which would logically be the first one on the periodic table. I don't think any other element comes before it because that's how the numbering works in chemistry. The context doesn't mention anything about a zeroth element or anything like that. It starts counting from hydrogen.  I also recall that elements are arranged by atomic number so no matter what hydrogen will always be first since its atomic number is 1. Even though some elements were synthesized later and found naturally after their discovery the numbering remains consistent based on their properties rather than when they were discovered or synthesized.

Question: who won the 30 man royal rumble match
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who won the 30-man Royal Rumble match. From what I remember Royal Rumble is a big event in WWE where they have these main events that build up to WrestleMania. The 30-man match sounds like it was a really intense and long match.  I think the last time I heard about a 30-man Royal Rumble was at some point around 2015 maybe 2016 or so. Was that in New York? I believe Andre The Giant was involved there because he's a big name. If I recall correctly he faced off against the babyfaces led by Edge and Chris Jericho.  Wait but the context provided mentions a DVD titled ""Royal Rumble: The Complete Anthology"" released in March 2007 which includes all events up to 2007. So that must be when I should look for information about matches from that era. But the question is about a 30-man match and maybe there was only one in 2007.  Looking at the context again it doesn't specify who won any particular match beyond the overall titles. It just mentions that the DVD covers up to 2007. So perhaps the 30-man Royal Rumble didn't happen before 2007? Or maybe there was only one instance in 2007.  Wait maybe I'm mixing things up. In 2016 there were some big matches including the 38-man Hell's Gate. So if the question is about a 30-man match perhaps it happened before that. But according to the context provided all matches up to 2007 are covered so maybe in 2007 they had only one or no such massive match.  But I think there was an exception where only two participants were present Andre The Giant and someone else but it wasn't a full 30-man match. So perhaps the answer is that the 30-man Royal Rumble didn't occur in 2007 as per the context or maybe it's not covered because it only happened once with fewer participants.  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me try to break it down. The context says the DVD includes all events up to 2007. So if there was a 30-man Royal Rumble in 2007 it should be on that DVD. But from my memory the last time there was a big match like that was before 2007. Maybe I'm mixing up different eras.  Alternatively perhaps the answer is that Andre The Giant won against Edge and Chris Jericho in a 30-man match at some point after 2007 but within the context of up to 2007 there wasn't such an event. So maybe the correct response is that no 30-man Royal Rumble occurred before or up to March 2007 as per the provided context.

Context: Economists generally believe that high rates of inflation and hyperinflation are caused by an excessive growth of the money supply . Views on which factors determine low to moderate rates of inflation are more varied . Low or moderate inflation may be attributed to fluctuations in real demand for goods and services , or changes in available supplies such as during scarcities . However , the consensus view is that a long sustained period of inflation is caused by money supply growing faster than the rate of economic growth . Inflation may also lead to an invisible tax in which the value of currency is lowered in contrast with its actual reserve ultimately , leading individuals to hold devalued legal tender .
Question: during periods of high inflation the money supply typically has been
Answer: ",Alright so I have this question about inflation and the money supply. Let me try to break it down step by step.  First the context says that economists believe high rates of inflation and hyperinflation are caused by excessive growth in the money supply. So if inflation is high they think a lot more money is being created than necessary or needed for the economy.  Then there's some variation in people's views on what causes low to moderate inflation. It mentions factors like real demand changes or supply shortages. But the main point is that sustained inflation over time happens when the money supply grows faster than the economy's growth rate.  The question specifically asks during periods of high inflation how has the money supply typically been? From the context it says high inflation is caused by excessive money supply growth. So I think the answer would be that the money supply has been growing too fast or more rapidly than needed.  I don't want to overcomplicate this. The context directly states that high inflation results from excessive money supply growth. So the answer should reflect that.

I don't see any mention of Genie in this context so perhaps it wasn't covered here. Since the question is about Ferris Bueller's Day Off I'm not sure if there was another actor involved beyond the ones listed. Maybe the user needs to check elsewhere or recall that Genie isn't a main character? Or maybe they're referring to someone else.

Question: who plays the girl in wreck it ralph
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who plays the girl in ""Wreck It Ralph."" Let me start by recalling what I know about the movie. I remember that ""Wreck It Ralph"" is a movie where the main character is a boy named Ralph who gets beaten up and then decides to become aherosites which are these fancy superheroes.  Looking at the context provided it's a list of people involved in another movie called ""Sugar Rush."" The names listed include characters like Fix - It Felix Jr. Edie McClurg as Mary Ray S. Persi as Mayor Gene and others who play specific roles in their respective movies.  Wait but how does this relate to ""Wreck It Ralph""? I think the context might be confusing me here because it's from another movie not ""Wreck It Ralph."" So I need to separate the information given about ""Sugar Rush"" from what is needed for answering the question about ""Wreck It Ralph.""  Since the question is about ""Wreck It Ralph "" I should focus on that movie. From my memory the main female character in ""Wreck It Ralph"" is Mabel Ann Robinson who plays the part of the girl. She's played by Sarah Takahashi in the movie.  But let me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up roles from different movies. The context provided doesn't mention any names associated with ""Wreck It Ralph "" so it's probably better to rely on what I know about the movie itself. Sarah Takahashi is indeed the actress who plays Mabel the girlfriend of Ralph in the film.  So putting that together the answer should be Sarah Takahashi.

First for Michael Phelps it says he's won 28 medals in total—23 gold 3 silver and 2 bronze. That seems like a lot of medals so I'm thinking he might be the one with the most.  Then there's Marit Bjørgen from Norway. She has 15 medals which include 8 gold 4 silver and 3 bronze. Comparing the two 28 is more than 15 so Phelps must have won more medals overall.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out all the Planet of the Apes films based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts with ""Film (s) Original series Planet of the Apes (1968)."" So that's one movie right there—1968. Then it continues listing others: Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973). So that's five more films each released in consecutive years starting from 1970 to 1973.  Then it mentions a remake: Remake Planet of the Apes (2001). That makes six so far. Following that there are two reboot series: Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014). So now we're up to eight.  Next is War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) which brings the total to nine. I should double-check if there are any others mentioned but it seems like that's all the context provided.

Question: when was the first wonder woman comic released
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the first Wonder Woman comic was released. Let me go through the context provided step by step.  First I see that the context mentions that Wonder Woman is a fictional superhero from DC Comics and part of the Justice League. It also talks about her appearances in various comics over time.  Looking at the details given: The first appearance of Wonder Woman was in All Star Comics #8 from December 1941. Then her first cover date was on Sensation Comics #1 in January 1942.  I need to determine when the first comic release was. The first full appearance is probably when she first started showing up regularly which is All Star Comics #8. However sometimes the very first comic where a character appears might be considered her first release. But here it's mentioned that in December 1941 she appeared in All Star Comics #8 and then on Sensation Comics #1 the next January.  Wait but ""the first"" could refer to when she officially became part of DC's lineup or when a specific milestone happened like her debut. Since the context specifies that she first appeared in All Star Comics #8 in December 1941 that would be her initial appearance date.  However sometimes the first comic release for a character is considered as their first appearance on a regular comic strip. But here the first issue where Wonder Woman is featured is All Star Comics #8 from December 1941 and then there's Sensation Comics #1 in January 1942 which has her first cover.  But ""the first"" could be when she was first introduced to readers regardless of subsequent issues. So the answer might still be December 1941 as that's when she first appeared in All Star Comics #8.

The inventor is played by Christopher Lloyd and called Dr. Emmett Lathrop or Doc Brown.  Wait but the question is about the professor. I think Doc Brown has some academic background. Oh right!

The context mentions that ""Remember the Titans"" is a 2000 American sports film produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Boaz Yakin. Wait but the question is about ""The Titans "" not Remember the Titans. Hmm.  Okay maybe I need to look at the details provided in the context again. It says that ""The Titans"" is based on the true story of African-American coach Herman Boone portrayed by Denzel Washington and his attempt to integrate T.C.

So the actual year of the event was 1971.  I should make sure there's no confusion between the two titles. The movie based on the true story is clearly stated to be from 1971 in the context while ""Remember the Titans"" is a different film released later in 2000.

Question: when was the cleveland browns last winning game
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the Cleveland Browns last won a game. The context provided mentions ""Cleveland Browns Team Encyclopedia - Pro-Football-Reference.com"" and that it was retrieved on January 14 2017.   First I'm thinking about how Pro-Football-Reference.com typically structures their data. They usually have detailed records of every game a team has played including wins and losses. Since the question is about the last winning game I might look for the most recent game listed on their site after January 14 2017.  But wait without actually accessing the website it's tricky to get exact dates. However since they last updated the data in January 2017 any information beyond that might not be available or accurate. So maybe the Browns' most recent game before that update was a loss because after that date there were no more games listed.  Alternatively if I consider typical NFL seasons the Browns have had multiple playoff appearances and Super Bowl runs in recent years but without specific data it's hard to pinpoint exactly when their last win was. However given the information up to January 14 2017 perhaps their last win was before that date.  So based on this I might conclude that as of January 14 2017 the Browns' last winning game was in a prior season possibly when they were fighting for a playoff spot. But without exact data from their encyclopedia it's an educated guess.  As per the information available up to January 14 2017 the Cleveland Browns did not have any recent winning games listed beyond that date.

Question: who is the first indian climber of mount everest
Answer: ","Okay so I need to find out who was the first Indian climber of Mount Everest. From the context given it says that Anshu Jamsenpa was summited on May 21st 2017. Wait but the question is about the first Indian climber. Hmm.  Wait a second I think I remember something else. Was it a man? Maybe someone like Gyaneshwor Pal who tried in the late 60s or early 70s. But Anshu Jamsenpa's name comes up with that date which is more recent. So maybe he was the first Indian to summit it after all.  I should check if there are any earlier Indian climbers before him. I think there were attempts by others like Tenzing Norgay's team in 1950s but they didn't survive or were British teams. Then Gyaneshwor Pal attempted in '68 but maybe he was the first Indian climber overall? Or did he just attempt it without succeeding?  Wait the context says Anshu Jamsenpa summited on May 21st 2017 making him the first woman from a non-European country to summit Everest alone. But that doesn't necessarily mean he was the first Indian climber in terms of being the first ascent by an Indian.  So maybe Gyaneshwor Pal was the first Indian climber overall? Because Anshu Jamsenpa is more about her achievement as the first woman not necessarily the first Indian to summit. So perhaps the answer is Anshu Jamsenpa if she was Indian but I'm not sure of her nationality.  Wait looking back the context says ""Summited Anshu Jamsenpa India 21st May 2017."" Oh! So it's a typo? Maybe the name is actually Anju Jamsenpa or someone else. Wait no in the context it's written as ""Anshu Jamsenpa India "" so perhaps she was Indian.  But if that's the case then she would be the first woman from India to summit Everest alone but not necessarily the first Indian climber overall. Because maybe Gyaneshwor Pal was the first person from India to reach the summit even if he wasn't the first ascent because he didn't make it up.  Wait no. Anshu Jamsenpa being female might be the key here. The question is about the first Indian climber regardless of gender. So maybe Gyaneshwor Pal was the first Indian to reach the summit in an ascent but not necessarily the first Indian climber overall if he didn't make it.  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me think: The first person to climb Everest alone was Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953. But they were British and Indian respectively. Then Gyaneshwor Pal attempted in 1968 with a team that didn't reach the summit.  So perhaps Anshu Jamsenpa is the first woman from India to summit alone but the first Indian climber would be someone else maybe someone who made it up. Wait I think Anshu Jamsenpa's summit was on May 21st making her the first woman from a non-European country to do so.  But since the context also mentions ""Summited Anshu Jamsenpa India "" perhaps she is Indian which would make her the first Indian climber. But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively maybe Gyaneshwor Pal was the first Indian climber overall because he was an Indian attempting to climb.  Wait no I think Anshu Jamsenpa being the first woman from India means she's a climber but perhaps the first Indian climber is someone else who successfully reached the summit. Alternatively maybe Gyaneshwor Pal didn't make it so the first successful ascent by an Indian was someone else.  I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look up when Anshu Jamsenpa became the first woman from India to climb Everest alone but according to the context provided she did that on May 21st 2017.  So perhaps the answer is Anshu Jamsenpa because she's the one mentioned in the context as an Indian climber who summited. But I'm not entirely sure if ""climber"" refers to summiting successfully or just attempting.  Anshu Jamsenpa was the first woman from India to climb Mount Everest alone achieving this feat on May 21st 2017.

Question: who is the robot in lost in space 2018
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the robot is in ""Lost in Space 2018."" From what I remember the show is a sequel to ""Lost in Space "" which I think was a pretty popular sci-fi series. In the first one Brian Steele played this character named Victor Dhar right? He's an educated guy with a sense of entitlement and some underlying fears about not being good enough. But wait that's from memory; maybe details might have changed.  In the new show ""Lost in Space 2018 "" there's mention of another robot. The context provided lists several actors playing different characters. The first name that stands out is Raza Jaffrey as Victor Dhar again. So he must be reappearing. But since it's a spin-off or sequel maybe the name changes? Or perhaps he takes on a new role with a different robot.  Looking at the list the actors are: Raza Jaffrey (Victor) Ajay Friese as Vijay Dhar Veenu Sandhu as Prisha Dhar. Then there's Prisha's son Sibongile Mlambo as Angela Goddard? Wait no the names don't seem to add up. Maybe I misread that. Let me check again.  Wait it says: ""Prisha Dhar 's son Veenu Sandhu as Prisha Dhar ."" That seems confusing because if Prisha's son is named after her maybe there was a mix-up in roles. Then Sibongile Mlambo as Angela Goddard? Hmm maybe that's another character.  But the question is specifically about the robot. So perhaps Raza Jaffrey isn't playing Victor anymore but someone else. The next actors are Ajay Friese as Vijay Dhar Veenu Sandhu as Prisha Dhar and then others like Kiki Sukezane Amelia Burstyn etc.  Wait maybe the robot is played by a new actor not listed here? But in the context provided I don't see anyone else besides Raza Jaffrey who might be associated with a robot. Alternatively perhaps the robot's name isn't one of the main characters but someone else entirely. Maybe it's a recurring role or something.  Alternatively maybe the robot is played by Raza Jaffrey again under a different name or capacity. Let me think about the original show: Victor was the Robot. So in ""Lost in Space 2018 "" perhaps he's reprising his role but with a different twist. Alternatively could it be someone else? But from the list provided Raza Jaffrey is listed as playing Victor again.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The context mentions that Brian Steele plays the Robot in 2018 so perhaps he's reprising his role as Victor Dhar but under a new name or something else? Or perhaps it's another character entirely?  Alternatively considering that the initial show had a Robot played by someone else (I think Brian Steele might have been the original Victor) maybe in ""Lost in Space 2018 "" the Robot is a different character. But according to the context provided Raza Jaffrey is listed as Victor Dhar again so perhaps he's playing the Robot.  Wait but in the initial list Raza Jaffrey plays Victor Dhar not necessarily the Robot. Wait no maybe in ""Lost in Space "" Brian Steele was the Robot while Victor was another character? I might have mixed up who played whom.  In the first show Brian Steele played Victor Dhar and another actor played the Robot. But now according to the context provided here Raza Jaffrey is playing Victor again so perhaps he's reuniting with his role as the Robot? Or maybe not.  Alternatively perhaps the Robot in ""Lost in Space 2018"" isn't one of these main characters but a guest star. But from what I can gather Raza Jaffrey is listed as Victor Dhar again so perhaps he's playing the Robot now under his original name or with a different role.  Wait maybe in this context the robot is Raza Jaffrey playing Victor Dhar who is reuniting with the Robot. Alternatively perhaps the Robot's name has changed? But I don't think that's likely; usually characters keep their roles across sequels if they're well-liked.  So putting it all together from the context given Raza Jaffrey is listed as Victor Dhar in ""Lost in Space 2018 "" but since he was previously playing a different character (probably not the Robot) maybe this time he's taking on the Robot role. Alternatively perhaps another actor plays him.  Wait no looking again: the context lists Raza Jaffrey as Victor Dhar. But in ""Lost in Space"" 2018 Brian Steele played the Robot. So perhaps in the sequel Brian is reprising his role as the Robot under a different name or in a different capacity.  But according to the provided context it says: ""Brian Steele plays the Robot  an alien mechanoid being that Will first encounters on the planet that his family crash lands on ."" Wait but wait in the first show's context Brian was the Robot. So perhaps in this context Brian is playing another character and Raza Jaffrey is playing Victor again.  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me parse it carefully:  The question is about who plays the robot in ""Lost in Space 2018."" The context provided says that Brian Steele played the Robot in the first show. Now in this context for 2018's show they list Raza Jaffrey as Victor Dhar again.  So perhaps in this scenario Raza Jaffrey is playing the Robot again? Or maybe he's not; maybe he's just listed as an actor involved with the Robot role?  Wait no looking at the context for 2018: It says ""Brian Steele plays the Robot "" which implies that in 2018 Brian is back as the Robot. So the answer should be Brian Steele.  But wait earlier I thought he was playing Victor Dhar. Hmm. Let me check again:  In the initial context for ""Lost in Space "" Brian Steele played the Robot. Now in this context provided for ""Lost in Space 2018 "" it says that Raza Jaffrey is playing Victor Dhar and Brian is still involved as the Robot.  Wait no the user's message says: ""Question: who is the robot in lost in space 2018"" with the context including names like Brian Steele. So perhaps in this case Brian is reuniting with his original role of the Robot.  So putting it all together I think the robot in ""Lost in Space 2018"" is played by Brian Steele again.

Question: what is money as a medium of exchange
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what money is as a medium of exchange based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that money has inherent fragility especially in electronic voting. It says some economists argue that units of account shouldn't be abstracted or confused with nominal units or tokens used in exchange. Then it clarifies that a medium is just that—a medium—and shouldn't be confused with the message.  Hmm so focusing on ""medium of exchange "" the context doesn't explicitly state its definition but it does talk about money not being confused with other concepts. I remember from basic economics that there are three functions of money: medium of exchange store of value and transfer of value. The context here is mainly talking about the medium function because it discusses how money is used in transactions.  So based on this money's role as a medium of exchange would be its ability to facilitate the exchange of goods and services by acting as a generally accepted form of payment. It allows people to give and receive value without barter systems which are more time-consuming and less efficient.

Question: where are the four disney theme parks located
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where all four Disney theme parks are located. I know that Disneyland and Walt Disney World are pretty famous but I'm not exactly sure about the others. Let me think.  First Disneyland is in Anaheim California. That's the one I've heard a lot about. Then there's Walt Disney World which is further south probably in Florida since a lot of their parks are by the beach.  Now what about the other two? I remember hearing something about Mexico having a Disney theme park. So that must be Disneyland Mexico right? That makes sense because it would allow fans to visit during different seasons or for vacation spots.  The last one is probably in Tokyo Japan. I think they have an International version of a Disney park there because Japanese culture often incorporates international elements. So that's Tokyo Disneyland which opened a while back but was maybe rebranded or something.  Wait did I miss any? Let me count: Anaheim (USA) Florida (USA) Mexico (Mexico) Japan (Japan). That makes four so I think that's all of them. Yep that should cover it.  Disneyland is located in Anaheim California USA; Walt Disney World is in Orlando Florida USA; Disneyland Mexico is in Anaheim California and Tokyo Disneyland is in Tokyo Japan.

Context: The Oregon Country was a predominantly American term referring to a disputed region of the Pacific Northwest of North America . The region was occupied by British and French Canadian fur traders from before 1810 , and American settlers from the mid-1830s , with its coastal areas north from the Columbia River frequented by ships from all nations engaged in the maritime fur trade , most of these from the 1790s through 1810s being Boston - based . The Oregon Treaty of 1846 ended disputed joint occupancy pursuant to the Treaty of 1818 and established the British - American boundary at the 49th parallel ( except Vancouver Island ) .
Question: who did the us share the oregon country with
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who the US shared the Oregon Country with based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by explaining that the Oregon Country was a disputed region in the Pacific Northwest of North America. It mentions that it was occupied by British and Canadian fur traders before 1810 and then by American settlers starting from the mid-1830s. The coastal areas north of the Columbia River were frequented by ships from various nations involved in the maritime fur trade mostly from the 1790s to 1810s specifically Boston-based.  The Oregon Treaty of 1846 ended the disputed joint occupancy and set the boundary at the 49th parallel except for Vancouver Island.   So looking at this the main groups mentioned are British and Canadian (from before 1810) and later American settlers. The US is mentioned in relation to the boundary established after the treaty.  Wait but the question is about who the US shared the Oregon Country with. From the context prior to 1810 it was occupied by British and Canadian traders but then from mid-1830s American settlers took over. The US probably shares this territory with them since they established the boundary.  I think the answer is that the US shared the Oregon Country with Canada. That makes sense because before 1810 it was British and Canadian so now maybe they are sharing as part of their boundary.

Pluto was also identified with the obscure Roman Orcus , like Hades the name of both a god of the underworld and the underworld as a place . The borrowed Greek name Pluto is sometimes used for the ruler of the dead in Latin literature , leading some mythology handbooks to assert misleadingly that Pluto was the Roman counterpart of Hades . Pluto ( Pluton in French and German , Plutone in Italian ) becomes the most common name for the classical ruler of the underworld in subsequent Western literature and other art forms .
Question: roman god of the underworld also called orcus or pluto
Answer: ","Okay so I need to find out which Roman god is associated with the underworld and is also known as both Orcus and Pluto. Let me start by recalling what I know about Roman mythology.  I remember that Hades was a significant figure in Greek mythology being the king of the Underworld. Then when looking into Roman equivalents I think Pluton or Plutus might be related to Hades since Roman gods sometimes borrow Greek names for their own entities.  The context provided mentions that Pluto's Latinized form is Pluton and it was also called Dis Pater which translates to ""Rich Father."" But the question specifically asks about the god known as both Orcus and Pluto. Wait in the context it says Pluto (Pluton) becomes the most common name for the classical ruler of the underworld in subsequent Western literature and other art forms. It also mentions that Hades is the Greek equivalent but that some mistakenly say Pluto was the Roman counterpart.  Hmm maybe I'm mixing up the names here. The initial context says that Pluto's Roman equivalent is Dis Pater which is ""Rich Father "" but perhaps another name might have been used as well. Wait the user provided a part where it mentions that Pluto (Pluton) is sometimes called Orcus in Latin literature. So Orcus and Pluton are both associated with Hades or Pluto.  Wait so maybe the answer is Orcus which was the Roman name for the god of the underworld along with his name being Pluton. But I'm a bit confused because another part mentions that sometimes it's referred to as Dis Pater but perhaps in some contexts it's called Orcus or Pluto.  Wait let me re-read the context carefully: ""Pluto 's Roman equivalent is Dis Pater  whose name is most often taken to mean `` Rich Father '' and is perhaps a direct translation of Plouton . Pluto was also identified with the obscure Roman Orcus  like Hades the name of both a god of the underworld and the underworld as a place . The borrowed Greek name Pluto is sometimes used for the ruler of the dead in Latin literature  leading some mythology handbooks to assert misleadingly that Pluto was the Roman counterpart of Hades .""  So from this context it seems that the Roman name for the god is both Pluton and possibly Orcus. Wait no the direct mention is that Pluton (Pluto) is sometimes used as the Roman name for the ruler of the dead who is also called Orcus.  Wait perhaps the answer is simply Hades because in Greek mythology he's the king of the Underworld. But wait the question is asking about the Roman god not the Greek one. So looking back at the context: ""Pluto ( Pluton in French and German  Plutone in Italian ) becomes the most common name for the classical ruler of the underworld in subsequent Western literature and other art forms.""  Wait maybe I got it wrong. In the initial part it says that Hades is like Orcus and also like Pluto. So perhaps the answer is Orcus which was the Roman name corresponding to Hades and Pluto.  But then again the context mentions Pluton as the Latinized form of Greek Plouton which is the same as Pluto in English. So maybe the answer is both Pluton and Orcus? But I'm a bit confused because sometimes Pluton is referred to as Orcus or perhaps they are the same.  Alternatively looking at sources I recall that the Roman god for Hades is Orcus. So perhaps the answer is Orcus.

Context: Pluto 's prime meridian is defined as the center of the face that is always pointed towards Charon , its largest moon , as the two are tidally locked towards each other .
Question: where is the meridian that is opposite the prime meridian located
Answer: ",Okay so I have this question about Pluto's meridians. The context says that Pluto's prime meridian is at the center of the face always pointed towards Charon its largest moon because they're tidally locked.  I need to find where the opposite meridian (the one that's 180 degrees away) is located. Since Earth's prime meridian goes through Greenwich and the antimeridian would be 180 degrees east or west of it I guess something similar happens on Pluto.  So if Pluto's prime meridian is facing Charon then the opposite side should be where? It makes sense that the antimeridian on Pluto would point in the opposite direction from Charon. So instead of facing away maybe it points towards a place directly opposite across the planet.  I think the answer would mention that the antimeridian is centered at the point opposite to where Charon is seen from the prime meridian. So when you're looking one way (towards Charon) from the prime 180 degrees over would be the other side.  The meridian opposite Pluto's prime meridian is located on the side of the planet that faces away from Charon., meridian opposite plutos prime meridian is located on side of planet that faces away from charon,the 180th meridian,0,0.1111111111111111,2.200926099991193,0.0007481849650344347,0.00021968251098638796,0.0,0.0,0.0

They decide later in life to get married.  Okay so focusing on what Zonia receives from Reuben. The key part is when Reuben tells her he can kiss her on the lips which I assume is a physical gesture of affection or commitment. Then they mention getting married later. So that initial kiss would likely symbolize their promise or marriage to each other.

Dynamin also plays a role in many processes including division of organelles , cytokinesis and microbial pathogen resistance .
Question: dynamin is associated with which type of vesicle
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out what type of vesicle Dynamin is associated with. From the context provided I remember that Dynamin is a GTPase involved in endocytosis. Endocytosis involves the formation and fusion of vesicles. The question asks specifically about the type of vesicle it's associated with.  I see in the context that Dynamin plays a role in scission of newly formed vesicles from one cellular compartment like caveolae and their targeting to another compartment for fusion. Also it mentions Golgi apparatus involvement. So Dynamin is involved in both types of vesicles: caveolae-internalization vesicles and Golgi-associated vesicles.  Wait the user's initial answer says ""caveolae internalization."" But looking back at the context again it actually states that Dynamin is involved in scission from caveolae and their targeting to another compartment for fusion. It also mentions caveolae internalization as a process it's part of but perhaps more importantly it points out Golgi processes.  I think the key here is that Dynamin is mainly known for its role in caveola-to-Golgi vesicle fusion.

Question: when did john steinbeck write of mice and me
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when John Steinbeck wrote ""Of Mice and Men."" The user provided a context where it says that Of Mice and Men is a novella by Steinbeck published in 1937. It tells the story of George Milton and Lennie Small during the Great Depression.  Wait but I remember hearing before that it's set around World War II. So there might be some confusion here. The novel was actually written much earlier than WWII because Steinbeck himself had written other works before that time. He wrote ""The Grapes of Wrath"" in 1935-1936 which is about similar themes but set during the time when Lennie and George are born.  So even though the novella deals with the Great Depression it was written after WWII started because Steinbeck's previous work was before that. So maybe ""Of Mice and Men"" was actually published in 1937 right after ""The Grapes of Wrath."" But some sources might mistakenly associate it with WWII setting.

Question: who is eliminated in big boss kannada 5
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who was eliminated in Big Boss Kannada Season 5. The user provided a context with a list of housemates along with their occupation contestant type and status at different days.   First I'll go through each entry one by one to see which ones mention being evicted.  Looking at the list:  - Chandan Shetty: Runner up - Divakar Sales rep: Contestant entered on Day 77 finale contestant - Karthik Jayaram: Celebrity finale contestant - Niveditha Gowda: Student winner - Shruti Prakash: Singer celebrity finale - Sameer Acharya: Priest audioned evicted on Day 99 - Anupama Gowda: TV actress audioned evicted on Day 98 - Riyaz Basha: Radio jockey audioned evicted on Day 91 - Krishi Thapanda: Model/actress audioned evicted on Day 35; reentered on 42 and 84 - Jaya Sreenivasan: Numerologist audioned evicted on 77 - Jagannath Chandrashekhar: TV Celebrity evicted on 63 - Ashitha Chandrappa: TV actress audioned evicted on 56 - Sihi Kahi Chandru: Actor/presenter audioned evicted on 49 - Tejaswini Prakash: TV/actor audioned walked Day 25 reentered and evicted Day 28 - Dayal Padmanabhan: Film director etc. audioned evicted Day 21 - Megha Student audioned evicted Day 14 - Suma Rajkumar: Homemaker/ventriloquist audioned evicted Day7  From this list the ones marked as eliminated are those with ""Evicted on"" followed by a day number. So I need to collect all the names along with their respective days they were evicted.  So the evictions happened on Days 14 (Megha) 21 (Dayal) 25 (Tejaswini walked but she was also evicted Day28) and then others had specific days. Wait looking again:   - Tejaswini Prakash: Walked on Day25; Reentered on 26; Evicted on 28. So her eviction is Day28.  Sameer Acharya: Day99 Anupama Gowda: Day98 Riyaz Basha: Day91 Jaya Sreenivasan: Day77 Krishi Thapanda: Day35 and 84 (she was evicted on both days so perhaps she's out) Shruti Prakash: She won so not eliminated. Sameer is a priest who got evicted late.  Wait but the question is about who was eliminated in Big Boss Kannada 5. So looking for all the housemates who were evicted during Season5.  The user provided an answer with Sameer Acharya (Day99) Anupama Gowda (Day98) Riyaz Basha (Day91) Jaya Sreenivasan (Day77). But also others like Tejaswini on Day28 Krishi Thapanda on 35 and 84. Suma Rajkumar was evicted on 7.  But the context given only lists each housemate once with their status at different days. So perhaps in this season they were focusing on specific eliminations but looking for the main ones who got evicted towards the end or known to be eliminated.  Looking back the initial answer provided by the user is: Sameer Acharya (99) Anupama Gowda (98) Riyaz Basha (91) Jaya Sreenivasan (77). So those four are likely the ones eliminated. But I should check if there's any other elimination that might be more notable.  Wait Tejaswini was a contestant until Day25 when she walked off and then reentered on 26 but was evicted on 28. So her eviction is also a valid answer.  But in the context given perhaps they are focusing on the main eliminations towards the end of the season or those with higher profile?

Question: where does the sciatic nerve run in the foot
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the sciatic nerve runs in the foot based on the provided context. The context mentions that according to Jewish law the sciatic nerve (Gid hanasheh) can't be eaten because Jacob was hurt by an angel during his struggle. Hmm not sure how that connects directly but maybe it's just background.  I remember from previous knowledge that the sciatic nerve originates in the back of the thigh and goes down through the abdomen to the foot. But I need to pinpoint exactly where it runs into the foot. From what I recall there are specific points on the foot where nerves emerge from the pelvis or脊柱 (spinal column). One is called the peroneal nerve which comes from the lower back.  Wait so does the sciatic nerve go through the peroneal nerve? Or maybe it's more specific. There's a term like the peroneal region of the foot where nerves emerge from the spinal canal. So perhaps the sciatic nerve exits the spine and goes into that area in the foot.  Putting it all together I think the sciatic nerve runs through the peroneal region into the sole of the foot or maybe the metatarsal area. But since the question is about where it runs into the foot I'm leaning towards the peroneal nerve being part of that pathway.  The sciatic nerve runs through the peroneal region of the foot.

Question: tempera is paint in which the vehicle is in
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what ""tempera"" refers to regarding the vehicle used for painting. From the context provided I know that Tempera is a type of paint medium made with colored pigments and a water-soluble binder usually something like egg yolk or another size.  Wait let me make sure I understand correctly. The term ""tempera"" can refer to both the medium itself and the actual paintings created using it. In this case the question is specifically asking about the vehicle which I think translates to the binder used in the paint.   Looking back at the context: ""Tempera also refers to the paintings done in this medium."" So Tempera includes both the medium (which has a vehicle) and the resulting artwork.  The first part says tempera consists of colored pigments mixed with a water-soluble binder which is often egg yolk or similar. So the vehicle here would be that binder—glutinous materials like egg yolk.  In the US there's also something called tempera paint used for posters but it mentions different binders and sizes compared to traditional tempera so maybe in this question we're focusing on the classic definition.  Putting it all together the vehicle (binder) is typically an egg-based substance. So the answer should be that Tempera uses a binder made from eggs or similar materials.

The result for the case of review improvidently granted is effectively the same as affirmed , but without that extra higher court stamp of approval .
Question: what state courts can order a new trial
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what state courts can order a new trial based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says something about reviewing courts with discretionary review sending cases back without comment if they think the review was Improvidently granted. It also mentions that the result is effectively an affirmed judgment but without the higher court's stamp.   Hmm so from this it seems like when a court grants a review improperly another court can decide to send the case back for a new trial. But wait does the context specify which type of court has the power to do that? The first part mentions reviewing courts with discretionary review but then it just says they sent it back without comment.  I think in general legal terms when a lower court improperly grants a review the higher court (like an appellate court) can set it aside or affirm. But if it's set aside sometimes that might result in a new trial. However not all courts have that power; only those with appellate jurisdiction typically do.  But wait the context doesn't explicitly mention state courts specifically having this power. It just talks about reviewing courts in general. So maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The answer should probably be that state courts can order a new trial when they determine a review was improperly granted by another court. Alternatively perhaps only appellate courts have that authority.  Wait but the context doesn't specify which type of court (like trial appellate) has this power. It just says reviewing courts with discretionary review may send it back without comment if the review was Improvidently granted. So in that case any reviewing court can do that? But I think usually only appellate courts have the power to overturn a decision and order a new trial.  I'm getting confused because the context isn't clear on which state courts specifically can do this. It just mentions reviewing courts having the discretion to send it back without comment if they decide the review was Improvidently granted. So maybe any court that has the ability to review like an appellate court in a state system can order a new trial.  So putting it all together I think the answer is that state courts (probably appellate) can order a new trial when there's an improper review decision.  State appellate courts are typically the ones with the authority to determine whether a review was improperly granted and if so to order a new trial.,state appellate courts are typically ones with authority to determine whether review was improperly granted and if so to order new trial,appellate court,0,0.08333333333333334,3.9582650999946054,0.0013861625392825388,0.0004070058628494902,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: where was the tv show high chaparral filmed
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out where the TV show ""High Chaparral"" was filmed. Let me look through the provided context again.  The context mentions that all exterior filming took place at Old Tucson Studios in Arizona and nearby Saguaro National Park. There were some episodes filmed in California and Coronado National Forest in Season 3 which is south of Tucson. However the interiors were usually filmed at NBC's television studios in Burbank Los Angeles.  Wait a minute but ""High Chaparral"" is actually part of the TV series ""Bonanza "" right? I remember that because some episodes are set in different places with various locations and sometimes they're in Arizona or Mexico. But for this specific question about filming locations.  So according to the context given most of the exterior filming was at Old Tucson Studios in Arizona and Saguaro National Park. The interiors were in Burbank Los Angeles.  The TV show ""High Chaparral "" which is part of the series ""Bonanza "" was filmed primarily at Old Tucson Studios in Arizona for exterior scenes and at NBC television studios in Burbank Los Angeles for interior filming.

Context: The 2017 NCAA Division I FBS football season was the highest level of college football competition in the United States organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) in 2017 . The regular season began on August 26 , 2017 and ended on December 9 , 2017 .
Question: when does the 2017 college football season end
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the 2017 college football season ends. The context provided mentions that it's a Division I FBS football season organized by the NCAA. The regular season starts on August 26 and ends on December 9 2017.   Hmm wait is that right? I think the college football season usually has two parts: the regular season and the bowl games. So the regular season runs from early September to late November or something like that but sometimes it can be a bit later depending on the year.  Wait no in 2017 according to the context given the regular season started on August 26th which is just over two months before the start of the college sports season. But usually the regular season for football starts around September or late August. Maybe the context here says August 26 because that's when teams typically report to training camps.  But then it mentions the regular season ends on December 9th 2017. So does that mean the season is from August 26 to December 9? That seems a bit long but considering there are also bowl games and such after that maybe not. Wait no college football typically doesn't have official bowl games until after the regular season ends.  Wait I think in most years the regular season runs from early September through November with bowl games happening afterward. But if the context says it ended on December 9th then perhaps that includes both the regular season and the bowl games.  But maybe the question is only asking about when the college football season ends which could be the end of the regular season or including the bowl games. However since the context specifically mentions that the regular season runs until December 9th I think that's referring to the end date of the regular season not including any bowl games.  Wait but actually in some cases the college football season as a whole might include both the regular season and the postseason like the bowl games. So maybe the question is asking when the entire season concludes which would be after the bowl games.  But looking back at the context provided it says ""the regular season began on August 26 2017 and ended on December 9 2017."" It doesn't mention anything beyond that. So if I have to answer when the college football season ends based on this context it would be December 9th.  Alternatively sometimes ""college football season"" refers specifically to the regular season so maybe the end date is December 9th. But I'm a bit confused because usually there are more games after that during bowl weeks.  Wait no in 2017 the college football bowl season typically started around January or early February with most bowls happening from then until mid-February. So if the regular season ended on December 9th and then teams go into bowl preparation maybe the overall season is considered to end after all bowl games are played.  But since the context doesn't mention any bowl games perhaps it's only referring to when the regular season ends as per that year. Therefore the answer would be December 9th.

Question: when was the last time astros was in the world series
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the Astros were last in the World Series. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  From the context it says that the Astros became the first franchise in MLB history to win a pennant in both the NL and AL in 2017. Then they won the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2017 as well.  So putting that together their last appearance was in 2017.

Wait no correction: In 2005 they were in the World Series but got swept. However it was in a different division and against a different team the Chicago White Sox not the Boston Red Sox.

Question: who do you play as in dragon age origins
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who the user is asking about. They provided a context from a game that sounds similar to Dragon Age. The question is asking who you play as in Dragon Age Origins.  Looking at the context they gave it's set in Ferelden during civil strife and involves players taking roles like warrior mage or rogue from elven human or dwarven backgrounds. They're part of the Grey Wards against Darkspawn aiming to defeat an Archdemon called the Blight.  Wait but Dragon Age: Origins is a different game right? It's set in the land of Alagaesha and involves different races like humans elves dwarves etc. also with classes like Rogue Wizard etc. So I think the user might be mixing up games because both have similar themes.  So when they ask who you play as in Dragon Age Origins it's probably expecting a character class from that specific game. The main classes are Rogue Wizard and Warrior. They each have unique abilities and roles.  But maybe the user is actually referring to Dragon Age: Origins but their context was about Ferelden and Grey Wards. That could be confusing because both games are part of the Dragon Age series but set in different worlds.  To answer accurately I should specify that without playing Dragon Age Origins specifically you choose between Rogue Wizard or Warrior. But since they provided a context from another game maybe they're asking about that instead?  Wait no the question is clearly about Dragon Age: Origins given how it's phrased. So my answer should be that in Dragon Age: Origins players can choose from Rogue Wizard or Warrior as their main class.  In Dragon Age: Origins you choose between Rogue Wizard or Warrior as your main class.

Context: The Rutherford model is a model of the atom devised by Ernest Rutherford . Rutherford directed the famous Geiger -- Marsden experiment in 1909 which suggested , upon Rutherford 's 1911 analysis , that J.J. Thomson 's plum pudding model of the atom was incorrect . Rutherford 's new model for the atom , based on the experimental results , contained the new features of a relatively high central charge concentrated into a very small volume in comparison to the rest of the atom and with this central volume also containing the bulk of the atomic mass of the atom . This region would be known as the `` nucleus '' of the atom .
Question: who made the nuclear model of an atom
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who made the nuclear model of the atom based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context starts by talking about Ernest Rutherford and his work in 1909 with the Geiger-Marsden experiment. It mentions that he analyzed the results and concluded that J.J. Thomson's plum pudding model was incorrect. Rutherford then developed a new model which introduced the concept of a central charge concentrated in a small volume called the nucleus.  So putting this together Rutherford is directly credited with creating the nuclear model of the atom.

Question: where is the ucla usc game being played
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the UCLA vs. USC game is being played based on the provided context. Let me start by looking through each entry in the context.  I see a list of dates with corresponding locations and winners. Each entry seems to be about a game between UCLA and USC as both schools are listed as participants or winners. My task is to determine where each particular game was held.  Looking at the first few entries: - Game 46 was on November 20 1976 at UCLA with a score of 24-14. Wait that doesn't make sense because UCLA is both playing and the winner here. Maybe that's not possible unless it's an upset.  Wait no perhaps each game has two locations listed as the winner? Or maybe the location where the game was held. Let me check each line carefully.  Game 1: November 20 1976 - Location: UCLA; Winner: UCLA #13 USC with a score of 24-14. Hmm this is confusing because both schools are mentioned as participants but then listed as the winner. That doesn't make sense unless it's an error.  Wait perhaps each entry has two games? No that seems unlikely. Maybe the first number is the game number followed by date and location then the winner and score.  Looking at Game 1: Date: November 20 1976; Location: UCLA; Winner: UCLA #13 USC (score 24-14). Wait that still doesn't make sense. Maybe the way it's formatted is different.  Wait perhaps each line represents a single game with the date location and the score but sometimes the winning school might be listed as another team if it was moved or something else happened. But in this case looking at Game 1: Location is UCLA; Winner: #13 USC? That doesn't add up because the location should indicate where the game was played.  Wait perhaps I misread the context. Let me parse each line correctly.  Each line seems to have four parts: - Game number (e.g. 46) - Date - Location - Winner and their score  But some entries list both schools as winners or participants which might indicate multiple games but that's not possible for a single game. So perhaps it's formatted differently.  Wait looking again: For Game 1: ""46 November 20  1976 UCLA # 13 USC 24 -- 14""  So the first number is the game number (46) followed by date and location (""November 20  1976 UCLA"") but that seems off because the location can't be ""UCLA"" if it's a single game.  Wait perhaps each line starts with the game number then has a space before the date. So for Game 46: Date is November 20 1976; Location is at UCLA (maybe the game was held at UCLA). Then the winner is #13 USC with a score of 24-14.  Wait that makes sense now. The location is mentioned after the date as ""UCLA"" indicating where the game took place. So for Game 46 it's played at UCLA.  So I need to look through each line and extract the location from each game entry.  Let me go through them one by one:  1. Game 46: Location is UCLA 2. Game 47: Location is USC 3. Game 48: Location is UCLA 4. Game 49: Location is USC 5. Game 50: Location is UCLA 6. Game 51: Location is USC 7. Game 52: Location is Rose Bowl   - Wait Rose Bowl is a bowl game location. 8. Game 53: Location is Coliseum (which I think is California's football stadium) 9. Game 54: Location is Rose Bowl 10. Game 55: Location is Coliseum ... And so on until Game 76 and beyond each specifying the location.  So my task is to list where each game was played based on this context. The question asks for the location of a specific game? Wait no—the user's actual query was about where the UCLA vs. USC game is being played but in the provided context it seems multiple games are listed with varying locations.  Wait looking back at the original question: ""Question: where is the ucla usc game being played""  But in the context given there are 76 entries each representing a game between UCLA and USC on different dates with varying locations such as UCLA USC's stadium (Coliseum) Rose Bowl etc.  Wait but perhaps the user meant to ask about a specific game? Or maybe they're asking generally based on the provided context. Since all games are between UCLA and USC I need to provide their locations from the context.  But looking at Game 81: November 26 2011 Coliseum with a score of 50-0 which is where USC's stadium in Los Angeles is located.  So perhaps the user wants me to list all the locations from the provided games. However the initial instruction was to answer based on the context given and provide concise answers without excessive reasoning or repetition.  But since each game has a different location I can't specify one without knowing which game they're referring to. Therefore I might need to clarify that more information is needed.  The UCLA vs. USC games are played at various locations as listed in the context including UCLA the Coliseum (Los Angeles) and the Rose Bowl among others.

Question: when was the electronic funds transfer act signed into law
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the Electronic Funds Transfer Act was signed into law. The context provided mentions that it was passed by the U.S. Congress in 1978 and signed by President Jimmy Carter.  Wait but sometimes when a bill is passed by Congress they don't always immediately sign it; they might send it to the president for approval. So I should check if there's any information about the signing date beyond just the passing year. The context only gives me that it was passed in 1978 and signed by Carter but not the exact month or day.  Hmm maybe I can recall historical facts. I think the act was signed a few months after it was passed. Let me see... President Carter's term ended in January 1981. If the signing happened around that time then the signing date would be late 1978. But without specific information I have to work with what's given.

I think it was on a Game Boy console because that's where a lot of these games started. The user mentioned ""Pokémon "" which is part of Nintendo's media franchise and developed by Game Freak.  Wait let me make sure. I believe the first Pokémon game was released in Japan for the Game Boy in 1996. That sounds right because it came out before some other popular games from that time. So yeah I'm pretty confident now.  The first Pokémon game was released on the Game Boy in Japan in 1996.

Question: when does the shape of water book come out
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when ""The Shape of Water"" book was released. From what I know the movie ""The Shape of Water"" is based on a novel by Stephen King. I remember hearing that the movie came out in 1999 after it was acquired by Fox Searchlight. But do they also release the book? Sometimes movies are based on books but I'm not sure when this particular one was published.  I think Stephen King's novels often have multiple sequels and follow-up works so maybe ""The Shape of Water"" book came out before or after the movie. Let me try to recall any information about it. Oh right sometimes the book is released a few years before the movie if there are plans for sequels. So perhaps ""The Shape of Water"" was published in 1996 when King was writing his new stories.  I don't have exact dates but I'm pretty sure that's around when it came out as a book. The movie being after makes sense because movies usually take longer to produce and distribute.

The user mentioned that Keegan plays Sammy who is Beca's boss and a rude successful producer at Residual Heat. Hmm wait is Keegan from Residual Heat? Or maybe it's someone else.

The main characters are played by Ryanah Cawley as Beca Josh Gad as Benji and Keegan as Sammy. Now I remember that Sammy is a music producer at Residual Heat but in the movie they also mention another character who's part of a rival record label.  I think it was Will Ar ellis who plays this other music producer. He's from the band ""The Suburbs "" right? So maybe he's involved with the rival label and has some influence over the story.

So if the context mentions her winning an Annie Award related to voice acting in an animated TV production and given that she plays Meg Griffin who is the father of Lois then it's likely that she's the one playing her dad.

574,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: In the United States , a continuing resolution ( often abbreviated to CR ) is a type of appropriations legislation . An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates ( gives to , sets aside for ) money to specific federal government departments , agencies , and programs . The money provides funding for operations , personnel , equipment , and activities . Regular appropriations bills are passed annually , with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year . The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government , which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year . When Congress and the president fail to agree on and pass one or more of the regular appropriations bills , a continuing resolution can be passed instead . A continuing resolution continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year ( or with minor modifications ) for a set amount of time . Continuing resolutions typically provide funding at a rate or formula based on the previous year 's funding . The funding extends until a specific date or regular appropriations bills are passed , whichever comes first . There can be some changes to some of the accounts in a continuing resolution . The continuing resolution takes the form of a joint resolution , and may provide bridging funding for existing federal programs at current , reduced , or expanded levels .
Question: what is the purpose of a continuing resolution
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the purpose of a continuing resolution based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by explaining that a continuing resolution (CR) is a type of appropriations legislation in the U.S. It says that an appropriations bill allocates money to federal agencies and programs. Regular appropriations are passed annually covering one fiscal year.   When Congress and the president can't agree on these regular bills a CR can be used instead. A CR continues the previous year's funding for a set amount of time with possible minor changes. It provides funding at a rate based on last year's amounts. The funding continues until another appropriations bill is passed or some other date.  So putting this together the main purpose of a continuing resolution is to keep funding active when regular appropriations aren't agreed upon. It allows the government to continue operations without new laws being enacted each year ensuring that departments and programs don't shut down due to ongoing legislative gridlock.  The purpose of a continuing resolution is to provide temporary funding for federal agencies and programs during periods when Congress and the president fail to agree on regular appropriations bills allowing continued operations until such agreements are reached or new legislation is passed., purpose of continuing resolution is to provide temporary funding for federal agencies and programs during periods when congress and president fail to agree on regular appropriations bills allowing continued operations until such agreements are reached or new legislation is passed,"provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities",0,0.16666666666666669,2.2778895999945235,0.0007787597270916327,0.00022865989066579313,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: Veronica is a female given name , the Latin transliteration of the Greek name Berenice , Βερενίκη . This was the Macedonian form of the Athenian Φερενίκη , Phereníkē , or Φερονίκη , Pheroníkē , from φέρειν , phérein , to bring , and νίκη , níkê , `` victory '' , i.e. `` she who brings victory '' . The Ancient Macedonian form of the name was popularized because of its extensive use as a royal feminine name by the reigning dynasties of the states of the Diadochi of Alexander the Great throughout the Eastern Mediterranean during the Hellenistic age , most notably by the Ptolemies of Egypt and by the Seleucids of Asia . In medieval etymology , Veronica was sometimes wrongly supposed to derive from Latin vera ( true ) and Greek eikon ( image ) . Its popularity in medieval and modern times is based mainly on the importance in Christianity of Saint Veronica and her Veil of Veronica . Pet forms of Veronica include Ronnie and Roni and the German Frony . In Russian , the pet form is Nika ( Ника ) . `` Veronica '' is a popular name in many countries in the Mediterranean , Eastern Europe , and Latin America , as well as southern Ireland , France , and French - speaking Canada .
Question: what is the meaning of veronica in english
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the meaning of ""Veronica"" in English based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by explaining that Veronica is a female given name with a Latin origin. It mentions that it's derived from Greek Berenice which further translates to something else. The Greek name Βερενίκη (Berenikē) comes from two words: φέρειν (phèrein) meaning ""to bring "" and νίκη (nike) meaning ""victory."" So literally it means ""she who brings victory.""  Then the context talks about its popularity in ancient times. It was used as a royal name by various dynasties in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Hellenistic age like the Ptolemies and Seleucids. So that's historical background.  Further down the etymology section mentions that some people thought Veronica came from Latin ""vera"" (true) and Greek ""eikon"" (image) but this was a mistake because the actual origin is from ""phèrein"" and ""nike.""  So putting it all together the primary meaning of Veronica is tied to victory. The Greek roots mean she brings victory so in English that's probably how it's understood.  I should make sure I'm not confusing it with any other meanings or uses mentioned like the pet forms or names in different languages. But for this question which asks just for the meaning of Veronica in English the main meaning is tied to victory.

Sometimes authors wrote during specific eras but without additional details like references to historical events or styles present in the text I can't make an educated guess about the time.  Also since the answer is ""Never "" it implies that no sources confirm when it was written.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who sang the theme song for Season 5 of The Wire. Let me go through the context provided step by step.  First the context mentions that different versions were used each season. It lists several artists and groups from Seasons 1 to 4: The Blind Boys of Alabama Tom Waits The Neville Brothers DoMaJe and Steve Earle. Each of these was used in their respective seasons.  Then it specifically talks about Season 4's version being performed by a group called Ivan Ashford Markel Steele Cameron Brown Tariq Al-Sabir and Avery Bargasse from Baltimore. It also mentions that an extended version of The Blind Boys of Alabama's recording was used in the series finale.  Now looking for information about Season 5. Since there's no mention of any artists or groups listed for Season 5 it seems like they didn't use any of the previously mentioned performers. That leaves me with the fact that perhaps Season 5's theme song wasn't recorded by any of these names because the context only provides up to Season 4.  Wait but the initial information might not have included Season 5 at all. The context provided is about Seasons 1-4 and the finale so maybe Season 5 didn't use a specific artist listed in the context.

Question: who sings oh what a night late december back in 63
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who sang ""Oh What a Night! Late December Back in '63."" Hmm the context provided mentions that ""December 1963 (Oh What a Night)"" is a song by the Four Seasons. It was written by Bob Gaudio and Judy Parker produced by Gaudio and included on their album ""Who Loves You"" from 1975.  Wait but the question is about when it was released in '63 which is earlier than the album release in '75. So maybe there's a version of the song from December 1963 that I'm not aware of? Or perhaps the context given isn't accurate for the '63 release.  Let me think... The Four Seasons did perform at the Hollywood Bowl on December 14 1963 but was ""Oh What a Night!"" played there? I don't recall hearing about it specifically. Maybe the album version is the only reference available. Alternatively could it be that the song's original recording or another version from '63 exists outside of the album?  I should also consider if Bob Gaudio and Judy Parker were part of the Four Seasons during that time. From what I know Bob Gaudio was in the group around 1958-1974 so it's possible he was still with them in December '63. But again unless ""Oh What a Night!"" was recorded live that night or released as a single it might not be directly tied to that album.  Since the context provided only mentions the song being on the 1975 album and written by Gaudio and Parker maybe I should stick with that information for the answer. However the question asks specifically about December '63 which complicates things because the context doesn't provide a release date for that version.  Wait perhaps there's confusion between ""Oh What a Night!"" (the song) being released in 1975 and another song from December '63 called ""Late December Back in '63."" Or maybe it's the same song but with different versions. I'm not sure so to be accurate I should probably state that based on the provided context the Four Seasons sang a song titled ""Oh What a Night"" on their 1975 album but without specific info on December '63.  But since the user is asking for who sang it back in '63 and considering possible misremembering of song titles maybe I should check if ""Late December Back in '63"" was actually another song by them. Alternatively perhaps ""Oh What a Night!"" had different versions across years.  Wait upon checking my knowledge the Four Seasons did have a song called ""Oh What a Night!"" released in 1975 as part of their album. However I don't recall an official version from December '63 with that exact title. It's possible that there was an early version or another song with similar themes but different titles.  Therefore based on the context given and my current knowledge it seems ""Oh What a Night!"" was released in 1975 by the Four Seasons so answering who sang it back in '63 might be tricky without more specific info. But since the context doesn't provide that I'll stick to what's available.

Question: where is nuclear energy used most in the world
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where nuclear energy is used the most in the world based on the given data. Let me look at the context provided.  First I see that the data lists various countries along with their number of operated reactors capacity net total electricity generated (in MW) and the share of total electricity use.   I remember that the question is about where nuclear energy is most used so I should focus on the 'Share of total electricity use' column. The higher this percentage is the more a country uses nuclear energy relative to its electricity consumption.  Looking at the table:  - The United States has 19.7%. - The United Kingdom follows with 20.4%. - Switzerland has an impressive 34.4%. - Germany is next with 13.1% but wait no—looking again actually France has 72.3%. Hmm maybe I misread that.  Wait let me check the data again carefully:  Ah yes! The country with the highest share is France at 72.3% of its electricity use comes from nuclear power. Then it's followed by Switzerland at 34.4% then the United Kingdom at 20.4% and the United States at 19.7%.

The topography of the battlefield has been altered by subsequent construction work for the abbey , and the slope defended by the English is now much less steep than it was at the time of the battle ; the top of the ridge has also been built up and levelled . After the Dissolution of the Monasteries , the abbey 's lands passed to secular landowners , who used it as a residence or country house . In 1976 the estate was put up for sale and purchased by the government with the aid of some American donors who wished to honour the 200th anniversary of American independence . The battlefield and abbey grounds are currently owned and administered by English Heritage and are open to the public . The Bayeux Tapestry is an embroidered narrative of the events leading up to Hastings probably commissioned by Odo of Bayeux soon after the battle , perhaps to hang at the bishop 's palace at Bayeux . In modern times annual reenactments of the Battle of Hastings have drawn thousands of participants and spectators to the site of the original battle .
Question: what norman leader won a military victory at the battle
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out which Norman leader won a military victory at the Battle of Hastings based on the provided context. Let's break down the information given.  First the context mentions that William founded Battle Abbey and made a vow to found it. According to sources from the 12th century William was supposed to create the abbey. Then it says more likely the foundation was imposed on William by papal legates in 1070. Wait but that seems contradictory because William is the one who founded it.  Further down it talks about Harold's death at the battlefield and the high altar being placed there. So Harold was probably a significant figure in the battle. Now the question is about the Norman leader who won the battle.  I recall that in 1066 Harold was the King of England leading an invasion against Normandy. But according to the context William made a vow to found the abbey and the foundation was imposed by papal legates on William. This seems conflicting because if William founded it he might not have been involved in the battle.  Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding. The context says that in 1070 the foundation was imposed by papal legates on William. So perhaps William was the Norman leader who established the abbey after the battle. That would mean William is the one who won as he founded it and had the right to impose the foundation.  But I'm a bit confused because Harold was Harold Godwinson the king who invaded Normandy in 1066. So if the question is about the Norman leader who won the battle that's likely Odo of Bayeux or another Norman commander. Wait no—the context mentions the Bayeux Tapestry being commissioned by Odo of Bayeux soon after the battle possibly to hang at a bishop's palace.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking which Norman leader won the battle. The battle was between England and Normandy in 1066. So the Norman leader would be the one from Normandy—probably William the Conqueror or Odo of Bayeux.  Looking back at the context it says that in 1070 the foundation was imposed on William by papal legates. If William is the Norman leader who founded the abbey after the battle then he won the battle. So perhaps the answer is William.  Wait but I think the correct answer should be Harold Godwinson as the English king and Odo of Bayeux as the Norman leader. But according to the context it's more about William being the one who founded the abbey after the battle so he might have been the Norman leader who imposed the foundation on himself.  Hmm maybe I'm getting confused between the Norman leaders and the English kings. The question is specifically asking for the Norman leader so perhaps Odo of Bayeux or another Norman commander won the battle. But according to the context it's more about William being the one who founded the abbey after the battle which might imply he was the Norman leader.  Wait maybe I should stick with the information given in the context. It mentions that the foundation was imposed on William by papal legates in 1070 so William is the Norman leader who won the battle because he was granted the authority to found the abbey after the victory.  The Norman leader who won the Battle of Hastings and had the authority to found Battle Abbey was **William**., norman leader who won battle of hastings and had authority to found battle abbey was william,"William, the Duke of Normandy",0,0.2,5.735813899998902,0.002025983540701502,0.0005948704828864273,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: By the end of 1952 , three individual highways were numbered `` Highway 401 '' : the partially completed Toronto Bypass between Weston Road and Highway 11 ( Yonge Street ) ; Highway 2A between West Hill and Newcastle ; and the Scenic Highway between Gananoque and Brockville , now known as the Thousand Islands Parkway . These three sections of highway were 11.8 , 54.7 and 41.2 km , ( 7.3 , 34.0 and 25.6 mi ) , respectively . In 1964 , the route became fully navigable from Windsor to the Ontario -- Quebec border . In 1965 it was given a second designation , the Macdonald -- Cartier Freeway , in honour of two Fathers of Confederation . At the end of 1968 , the Gananoque -- Brockville section was bypassed and the final intersection grade - separated near Kingston , making Highway 401 a freeway for its entire 817.9 - km length . On August 24 , 2007 , the portion of the highway between Glen Miller Road in Trenton and the Don Valley Parkway / Highway 404 Junction in Toronto was designated the Highway of Heroes , as the road is travelled by funeral convoys for fallen Canadian Forces personnel from CFB Trenton to the coroner 's office in Toronto . On September 27 , 2013 , the Highway of Heroes designation was extended west to Keele Street in Toronto , to coincide with the move of the coroner 's office to the new Forensic Services and Coroner 's Complex at the Humber River Hospital .

Context: Manuel is a male given name originating in the Hebrew name Immanu'el ( עִמָּנוּאֵל ‬ , which means `` God with us . '' It was possibly brought from the Byzantine Empire ( as Μανουήλ ) to Spain and Portugal , where it has been used since at least the 13th century . Manuel is popular in Spanish , Portuguese and German . It is also used in Italian , French , Romanian , Greek ( Latinized ) , Polish , Dutch and English , where Manny or Manu is used as a nickname .
Question: where does the last name manuel come from
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the last name ""Manuel"" comes from. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context talks about the given name Manuel which has its roots in Hebrew. It mentions that the name came from the Byzantine Empire as Μανουήλ and was brought to Spain and Portugal. I remember that sometimes people's last names can have a similar origin or meaning to their first name so maybe ""Manuel"" is related.  Wait the context says that Manuel is popular in several languages like Spanish Portuguese German Italian French Romanian Greek (Latinized) Polish Dutch and English. In some of these it's used as a nickname like Manny or Manu. But focusing on the last name part I think it might have a separate origin.  Given that the first name comes from the Hebrew Immanu'el perhaps the last name ""Manuel"" has a different etymology. Since it's common in several European languages maybe it's of Latin or Slavic origin. Let me think... In many Slavic languages names often come from Latin roots. For example I know that in Italian and Polish names like Manolo are used.  So putting this together ""Manuel"" as a last name likely comes from Latin. It might have been adopted from a Latinized version of an Arabic or other language name. Given that it's common in countries with Spanish or Portuguese influence maybe it originates from those regions via Latinization.  I'm not entirely sure about the exact Latin root but considering its usage and spread across multiple Slavic languages it's probably of Latin origin.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the University of Wisconsin-Madison is located. Let me go through this step by step.  First looking at the context provided it starts with ""The University of Wisconsin -- Madison (also known as..."" That tells me that the university's name can be referred to in multiple ways but the primary location seems to be somewhere specific.  Next I see that it says the university is a public research university located in Madison Wisconsin. So that gives me two pieces of information: Madison and Wisconsin. But wait Madison itself is a city so the context must specify which Madison they're talking about because there are several in the U.S. especially in other states like Arizona.  Continuing down it mentions that the university became the first public university established in Wisconsin. Since the state capital is Madison that makes sense. So putting this together the University of Wisconsin-Madison must be located in Madison Wisconsin.

Question: in texas how is the commissioner of insurance placed in office
Answer: ",Alright so I need to figure out how the Commissioner of Insurance in Texas is appointed. I remember that the context mentioned something about state constitutions and statutes and whether commissioners are appointed or elected.  First looking at the context provided it says that the powers of an insurance commissioner vary by state. They can be either appointed or elected depending on the jurisdiction. In Texas since they specifically asked about placement in office I should look into their specific system.  I think in many states especially those with a long history like Texas they typically appoint commissioners. The context doesn't mention Texas being an exception where they are elected instead of appointed. So it's likely that Texas follows the standard pattern where commissioners are appointed by the state legislature or governor.  Wait but I should double-check if there's any indication that Texas might have a different system. The context says some jurisdictions elect them while others appoint. But without specific info on Texas the default assumption would be they're appointed.

Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the Declaration of Independence was signed. From what I remember it's a really important document in US history. I think it happened during the American Revolution because that's when they were fighting against Britain.  The question is asking for the date.

Let me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing it up with other key dates. I know July 4th is when the Declaration was approved by the Second Continental Congress. That makes sense because it's earlier than August 2nd. The signing happened later which would be after the delegates had already received the document and decided to sign it.

Question: who is considered to be the greatest english composer of the baroque period
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who is considered the greatest English Baroque composer. Hmm let's see. I know that the Baroque period was a time when composers like Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel were active. They're both pretty famous.  Bach wrote so many pieces for various instruments; he has operas concertos and fugues. His music is really well-known and has a lot of influence on classical music. On the other hand Handel composed operas too—like ""The Magic Flute"" which I've heard about before—and his style was quite expressive.  I also remember that they were contemporaries but from different regions; Bach was German while Handel was English. But the question specifically asks for an English composer so Handel might be the answer. However sometimes people might consider someone else as well because of their impact or influence beyond just composition.  Wait there's also Isaac Newton and his contributions to music theory but he wasn't a composer per se; he was more of a scientist. Then there's John Dryer who wrote some early Baroque works for organ but I'm not sure if he's considered the greatest.  Another thought: Handel did write ""Dance between the Towers of London "" which is really elaborate and shows his mastery. But so did Bach—maybe his ""Brandenburg Concertos"" are more famous in terms of popularity.  I think it comes down to subjective opinion but historically both have been recognized as major composers. However since the question specifies English Handel might be the intended answer because he's clearly English and Baroque.

But just to be thorough I should check if anyone else has more than that.  Looking further down it says Sam Jones won ten championships from 1959 to 1969 which is the second most in NBA history. So Bill Russell still leads with 11 rings.  Then there's a list of other players and their respective championship counts. The four Celtics players each have eight some have seven six etc. but none reach more than ten or eleven. Jordan and Pippen have six each which is less than both Sam Jones and Bill Russell.

The original Karate Kid was released much earlier. I think it came out in the early 90s.  Let me try to remember specific years. 1984 comes to mind because that's when a lot of action movies were hitting and Karate Kid is definitely one of them. Also considering that ""The Karate Kid"" was remade with Jaden Smith it makes sense that the original came out earlier in his career.  I don't think I'm mixing this up with another Karate Kid movie.

From the context given it's a bit tricky because there are some mentions of Donna and Randy but it doesn't clearly say what happens at the end.  First I'll read through the provided context again carefully. It starts by talking about Eric leaving the show during its eighth season. After his departure he isn't the main focus anymore but his character still influences the show appearing in every episode of that season. Then it mentions that a month after the seventh season's finale Eric is shown to have become used to teaching in Africa.

Question: in order to prove disparate impact you first must establish
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what you have to do first to prove disparate impact under something like the Fair Housing Act or related laws. The question mentions that under the Fair Housing Act proving disparate impact requires establishing certain things.  From what I remember disparate impact isn't about direct discrimination but more about indirect effects. So maybe you can't just say someone was fired because of their race; it has to be a pattern over time. But I'm not sure exactly how that ties in with the process.  I think there are three main prongs for proving disparate impact: adverse impact scope and magnitude. So first you have to show that an action was taken against a protected class. Like if they fired people of color more than others but without specific intent. Then you have to demonstrate that it's not just a few cases but consistently happening over time or across different groups.  Wait the question is about what you must first establish. So maybe it starts with showing there's an adverse impact? That would be part one. After proving that there was some effect then you need to show that this impact specifically relates to a protected characteristic under the law like race or gender. And finally whether that effect actually caused harm or discrimination.  But I'm not 100% sure about the exact order here. Is it just showing adverse impact first? Or do you also have to establish some basis for the action before moving on?  I think generally in legal terms proving disparate impact starts with demonstrating a legitimate reason for the action and then showing that there's an adverse impact specific to protected characteristics. So maybe step one is establishing that there was an adverse impact without considering race or gender.  Wait no because the prongs usually go: first show that the action exists (adverse impact) then show it affects a protected class specifically and then that this caused the adverse effect. But in the context of the question it's asking what you must first establish to prove disparate impact. So perhaps the first thing is demonstrating that there was an adverse impact without considering the protected characteristics.  Alternatively maybe the first step is establishing that the protected group experienced a lower chance of success or got treated less favorably compared to non-protected groups because of the protected characteristic. But I'm getting confused now.  I think looking it up would help but since I can't do that right now I'll try to recall from what I know about discrimination cases. In cases involving disparate impact you first have to show that there was some adverse effect caused by the protected characteristic. So maybe step one is establishing that the protected group experienced a disparity.

To prove disparate impact under the Fair Housing Act or related laws you must first establish an adverse impact.

Question: where do characters live in this is us
Answer: ",Alright I'm trying to figure out where each character lives based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that most episodes feature a present storyline (2016-2018) and another at a set time in the past. It also notes that some episodes use flashbacks or only one setting period but mostly multiple time periods are involved.  Looking further it says:  - Various other time periods and locations have served as settings. - As adults:  - Kate lives in Los Angeles   - Randall and his family are in New Jersey   - Kevin relocates from Los Angeles to New York City.  So focusing on the adult characters' current or long-term living situations:  1. **Kate**: Lives in Los Angeles as an adult. 2. **Randall and his family**: Reside in New Jersey. 3. **Kevin**: Originally from Los Angeles but now lives in New York City.  I should make sure these are correct based on the context provided. The other time periods like 1980 or the Pittsburgh setting might be for flashbacks but the current living places are clearly stated for the adults as of they're alive now.  - Kate: Los Angeles - Randall and his family: New Jersey - Kevin: New York City, kevin new york city,Pittsburgh,0,0.0,2.292864199989708,0.0007880156856784327,0.00023137763068859708,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when was the last time the carolina hurricanes made the playoffs
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out when the Carolina Hurricanes made the playoffs based on the provided context. Let me go through the data step by step.  First looking at the context it's a table that covers various seasons from 1997-98 up to 2017-18. Each season has several columns: Team Conference Division Regular season Postseason Div. Finish Conf. Finish GP (games played) OT (overtime games) Pts (points) GF (goals for) GA (goals against) Result and Relocated from Hartford 1997.  I'm specifically looking for when the Carolina Hurricanes were part of the playoffs. The context mentions ""Playoff Appearances"" at the bottom with totals: 5. So they made the playoffs five times during that period.  Now I need to pinpoint each season they appeared in. Scanning through the table under the ""Playoff Appearances"" column it's a total of 5. I should look for rows where the Result mentions ""Playoffs"" or similar terms.  Looking at each year:  - 1997-98: Did not qualify. - 1998-99: 6th in Eastern Southeast did not qualify. - 1999-2000: 3rd in Eastern Southeast did not qualify. - 2000-01: 2nd in Eastern Southeast did not qualify (lost in Conference Quarterfinals). - 2001-02: Made playoffs and won several games; they had multiple wins but it's unclear from the data if they made it to the Stanley Cup Finals or just qualified. - 2003-04: Did not qualify. - 2005-06: Made playoffs winning multiple games and finals. That seems like one playoff appearance. - 2013-14: Did not qualify. - 2014-15: Did not qualify. - 2015-16: Did not qualify. - 2016-17: Did not qualify. - 2017-18: Did not qualify.  Wait the totals say 5 playoff appearances. So I must have missed some entries.  Looking again:  In 2004-05 the season was cancelled due to lockout so no playoffs there.  But then looking at other years maybe in 2008-09: ""Lost in Conference Finals 0--4 (Penguins)"" but that's a loss. However they won some games in the playoffs like winning in Semifinals and Finals.  Wait the context says in 2007-08: ""Won in Conference Semifinals 4--2 (Bruins)"" so that's one playoff appearance.  In 2005-06: ""Won in Conference Quarterfinals 4--2 (Canadiens) Won in Conference Semifinals 4--2 (Habs) Won in Conference Finals 4--2 (Maple Leafs) Lost in Stanley Cup Finals 1--4 (Red Wings)"" So that's a full set of playoff wins; so they made the playoffs once.  In 2008-09: ""Won in Conference Quarterfinals 4--3 (Devils) Won in Conference Semifinals 4--3 (Bruins) Lost in Conference Finals 0--4 (Penguins)"" So that's another playoff appearance.  Also checking 2015-16: ""Won in Conference Quarterfinals 4--3 (Canadiens) Won in Conference Semifinals 4--3 (Habs) Lost in Conference Finals 0--4 (Oilers)"" That's a third playoff appearance.  Wait but the total is five. Let me count:  1. 2005-06: One time. 2. 2008-09: Another time. 3. 2015-16: Third time. 4. Perhaps in 2007-08? But that was a loss so maybe not counted as making playoffs.  Wait looking at the data again:  In 2008-09: ""Lost in Conference Finals 0--4 (Penguins)"" but they won in Semifinals and Quarterfinals. So it's a playoff appearance where they made it to the Finals but lost there.  Similarly in 2015-16: Lost in Conference Finals 0--4 (Oilers) so another playoff attempt.  Wait that would be two more making total of four. But context says five.  Hmm maybe I missed one.  Looking at 2004-05 was canceled due to lockout so no playoffs.  Let me check each season:  1997-98: No 1998-99: No 1999-2000: No 2000-01: No 2001-02: Yes (won several including Finals) 2002-03: No 2003-04: No 2004-05: Cancelled 2005-06: Yes (quarterfinals semis finals; won all except finals loss) 2006-07: No 2007-08: Lost in Finals but had wins in QF and SF. So another playoff appearance. 2008-09: Lost in Finals but had wins in QF and SF. Another appearance. 2009-10: No 2010-11: No 2011-12: No 2012-13: No (played in playoffs lost) Wait 2012-13 was Eastern Southeast but the context says ""Did not qualify"". Also they played in a game against Bruins on December 29 2013. So maybe that's a playoff appearance.  But according to the table under 2012-13: ""Did not qualify"" so no playoff.  Wait perhaps the user needs the exact years when Carolina made it to the playoffs at least once.  So from the data:  - 2005-06: Playoffs (won QF SF but lost in Finals) - 2007-08: Lost in Finals - 2008-09: Lost in Finals - 2015-16: Lost in Finals  But that's only four. The context says five playoff appearances.  Wait maybe I missed the 2004-05 season? But it was canceled due to lockout so no playoffs.  Alternatively perhaps they made the playoffs more than once in some years?  Looking at each playoff appearance:  Each time they won a round but lost in higher rounds. So that counts as one playoff appearance per year where they reached at least the QF or SF.  So counting each year when they played in the playoffs (even if they lost):  2005-06: Yes 2007-08: Yes 2008-09: Yes 2015-16: Yes  That's four. But context says five.  Wait perhaps 2003-04 was a playoff? No the table shows ""Did not qualify"".  Maybe I need to look for specific playoff appearances beyond that.  Alternatively perhaps each time they won a round counts as an appearance.  In 2005-06: 3 wins (QF SF Finals) So that's one set where they made it to the Finals. Similarly in 2008-09: 2 wins (QF SF) so another set. In 2015-16: 2 wins (QF SF) another set.  That would be three sets but five appearances? Or maybe each win counts as one appearance.  But the table lists ""Playoff Appearances"" at the bottom as total 5. So perhaps it's five times they were in the playoffs across different seasons.  Wait looking back:  In 2005-06: ""Won in Conference Quarterfinals  4 -- 2 ( Canadiens ) Won in Conference Semifinals  4 -- 2 ( Devils ) Won in Conference Finals  4 -- 2 ( Sabres ) Won in Stanley Cup Finals  4 -- 3 ( Oilers )"" So that's four games but only one playoff appearance.  In 2008-09: ""Won in Conference Quarterfinals  4 -- 3 ( Devils ) Won in Conference Semifinals  4 -- 3 ( Bruins ) Lost in Conference Finals  0 -- 4 ( Penguins )"" So that's another set making two appearances.  In 2015-16: ""Won in Conference Quarterfinals  4 -- 3 ( Canadiens ) Won in Conference Semifinals  4 -- 3 ( Devils ) Lost in Conference Finals  0 -- 4 ( Oilers )"" That's a third appearance.  So that would be three playoff appearances. But the context says five so I must have missed two more.  Wait maybe looking at other years where they made it to QF or SF:  Looking again:  - 2005-06: Playoffs - 2008-09: Playoffs - 2015-16: Playoffs  That's three. But context says five so perhaps I'm missing some.  Wait in 2013-14: ""7th in Eastern Metropolitan"" but no playoff data there.  In 2003-04: Did not qualify.  Wait maybe the user is looking for when they made it to at least the Semis which would be more appearances. Or perhaps each time they won a round counts as an appearance.  Alternatively perhaps the table includes multiple appearances in some years beyond what's obvious.  Looking at 2017-18: ""Did not qualify""  But let me check again for each season:  - 1997-98: No - 1998-99: No - 1999-2000: No - 2000-01: No - 2001-02: Yes (winners) - 2002-03: No - 2003-04: No - 2004-05: Cancelled - 2005-06: Yes - 2006-07: No - 2007-08: No (lost in Finals) - 2008-09: Yes (lost in Finals) - 2009-10: No - 2010-11: No - 2011-12: No - 2012-13: No - 2013-14: No - 2014-15: No - 2015-16: Yes (lost in Finals) - 2016-17: No - 2017-18: No  So that's four playoff appearances. But the context says five.  Wait maybe in 2004-05 they were in playoffs but it was canceled so no.  Alternatively perhaps I missed a year where they made it to the Semis or Quarters.  Looking again:  In 2015-16: Made Semis and Quarters. In 2008-09: Made Semis and Quarters. In 2005-06: Made Semis Quarters Finals (but lost in Finals) So each of these counts as one playoff appearance.  That would be three. But context says five.  Wait maybe the table includes multiple appearances within a single season beyond just reaching the Finals. For example if they won multiple rounds in different games but I don't think so.  Alternatively perhaps each time they won a round is considered an appearance not the entire set of games.  In 2005-06: QF win (1) SF win (2) Finals loss (3). So three appearances. But that's unlikely; usually it's one playoff appearance to reach a certain round.  Same with 2008-09 and 2015-16: Each has two wins before losing in the next round. Still counts as one playoff appearance per season.  So total of three but context says five.  Wait maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check each season:  Looking at the table again for ""Playoff Appearances"":  Only 2005-06 2008-09 and 2015-16 are marked as having playoff wins.  But the context says total of five so perhaps each time they won a round counts individually.  In 2005-06: QF (1) SF (2) Finals (3) but lost in Finals. So three appearances. In 2008-09: QF (1) SF (2) lost in Finals. Two appearances. In 2015-16: QF (1) SF (2) lost in Finals. Two appearances.  But that would be seven which doesn't match the context's five.  Alternatively perhaps each time they reached a certain round counts as an appearance.  But I'm not sure. Maybe the user is simply asking for the years when Carolina made the playoffs at least once regardless of how far they got.  So in 2005-06: Yes In 2008-09: Yes In 2015-16: Yes  That's three. But context says five.  Wait perhaps I'm missing the 2003-04 season? No it was marked as ""Did not qualify"".  Alternatively maybe considering that each year they could have been in multiple playnings but I don't think so.  Given all this confusion and knowing that the total is five I'll list the years when Carolina made the playoffs at least once:  2005-06: Yes 2008-09: Yes 2015-16: Yes  But that's only three. Unless there are two more years where they made the playoffs.  Wait maybe 2003-04 is a playoff year? No it says ""Did not qualify"".  Alternatively perhaps in 2007-08 and 2009-10 they were in playoffs but didn't make it far. But looking at the table:  In 2007-08: Lost in Finals but had QF and SF wins. Similarly 2008-09: Same.  So that's two more years with playoff appearances.  Plus 2015-16: Three total.  But context says five. Maybe I'm still missing some.  Alternatively perhaps each time they reached the QF is an appearance so:  In 2005-06: QF (1) SF (2) Finals (3) So three appearances. In 2008-09: QF (4) SF (5) Finals (6). Wait but context says total of five.  This is getting too confusing. Based on the data provided and assuming each season where they reached at least the Semifinals counts as one playoff appearance the years would be:  2001-02: Yes 2005-06: Yes (Semis) 2008-09: Yes (Semis) 2015-16: Yes (Semis)  That's four. Still missing one.  Wait maybe in 2003-04 they were in the playoffs but didn't make it far? But no data on that.  Alternatively perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the answer is 2005 2008 and 2016. Wait let me check:  In 2005-06: Yes 2008-09: Yes 2016-17: No  So no.  Given all this confusion I'll proceed to list the years where they made the playoffs based on the data which are 2005 2008 and 2016. Wait but context says five appearances. Maybe it's better to state that Carolina made the playoffs in 2005 2008 and 2016. But I'm not sure.  Alternatively based on the data they made the playoffs three times: 2005 2008 2016.  But given that context says five perhaps it's better to conclude that the answer is 2005 2008 and 2016.  The Carolina Hurricanes made their first playoff appearances in the following years:  - **2005-06**: They won the Conference Quarterfinals Semifinals but lost in the Finals. - **2008-09**: They won the Conference Quarterfinals and Semifinals before losing in the Conference Finals. - **2015-16**: They secured victories in the Conference Quarterfinals and Semifinals though they lost in the Conference Finals.

Question: when is the new tappan zee bridge going to be finished
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the new Tappan Zee Bridge will be finished. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that Tappan Zee Constructors began construction in 2013. The north span opened on August 26 2017 both west and eastbound traffic. Then they started demolishing the old bridge. It mentions that eastbound traffic will switch to the south span once it's done. Both spans are expected to be operational by June 15 2018.  Wait so the construction of the new bridge was already underway before the north span opened in 2017. They started demolishing the old bridge after that. The completion of both spans is scheduled for June 15 2018. So does that mean the entire project including building and demolishing is expected to be done by 2018?  But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. It says both spans are operational by June 15 2018. That suggests that the new bridge will be fully operational then. So when is it going to be finished? I think ""finished"" might refer to the completion of construction and readiness for operation.  So if both spans are expected to be operational by June 2018 then perhaps the project was completed around that time. But sometimes projects have different phases—construction testing decommissioning etc.—so maybe they consider the finish date when everything is ready for use.  I don't see any specific date mentioned after 2018 in the context so I'll go with June 15 2018 as the expected completion date.

Question: who has been chosen as the brand ambassador of the campaign 'beti bachao-beti padhao
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who is the brand ambassador for the ""Beti Bachao Beti Padhao"" campaign. The user provided some context mentioning that Sakshi Malik was the bronze medallist in the Olympics in 2016 and she became a brand ambassador for BBBP. But wait the question is about ""Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao "" which I know is a big awareness campaign against female violence.  Hmm I'm trying to recall if Sakshi Malik was involved with this specific campaign. The context given talks about her being an Olympic medalist and her role as a BBBP ambassador. But does that mean she's also the brand ambassador for ""Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao""? Or is there another person?  I think I've heard before that Sakshi Malik has been involved with this campaign but maybe not directly as the brand ambassador. Wait no—the context provided only mentions her being a BBBP brand ambassador in 2016. So perhaps she's the one for BBBP? But ""Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao"" is another campaign by a different organization or company?  Wait actually ""Beti Bachao Beti Padhao"" is run by Swatch bank right? And the brand ambassadors are usually women who represent their communities. So maybe Sakshi Malik was chosen for that as well.  I'm getting confused because both campaigns involve the same group fighting against female violence. Maybe she's part of both? Or perhaps she's specifically for one of them now. Since the context mentions her being a BBBP brand ambassador I should check if that aligns with ""Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao.""  Wait no—BBBBP is a separate entity from Swatch bank. So maybe Sakshi Malik was chosen by both organizations because she's a prominent figure in promoting such causes.  I think the answer is Sakshi Malik has been chosen as the brand ambassador for ""Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao."" But I'm not 100% sure but based on the context provided it seems likely.

Question: how many seasons of prison break are on netflix
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out how many seasons of ""Prison Break"" are available on Netflix. I remember that ""Prison Break"" is a TV show but I'm not exactly sure about its availability on streaming platforms like Netflix.   From the context provided earlier it says that the third special episode was only aired on Sky1 in the UK and focuses on the beginning of its season. It includes making-of footage interviews with the cast and additional background information on the show and new main characters.  Wait but does this mean anything about how many seasons are available? The context doesn't mention anything about the availability of full seasons or special episodes on Netflix specifically. So I can't get any info from that.   I think I should recall what I know about ""Prison Break."" It's a series created by Alex Tveit based on the novel by Gillian Flynn. It originally aired on Sky1 in the UK and later got picked up for the US by AMC where it was quite popular. However I believe that after the first season it didn't get renewed for more seasons.   So from what I remember only one season of ""Prison Break"" is available on Netflix as a complete series.

600,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: Before the start of the Official World Golf Ranking in 1986 , unofficial world golf rankings were published in Mark McCormack 's World of Professional Golf Annual from 1968 to 1985 . These annual world golf rankings gave Jack Nicklaus as the number one from 1968 to 1977 , Tom Watson from 1978 to 1982 and Seve Ballesteros from 1983 to 1985 .
Question: who is the number one ranked golfer in the world right now
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who is currently the number one ranked golfer in the world. From what I know there have been various golf rankings over the years. The official World Golf Ranking started in 1986 with Jack Nicklaus leading for a long time until he was replaced by Tiger Woods.  Before that there were unofficial rankings published in Mark McCormack's ""World of Professional Golf"" from 1968 to 1985. According to this context Jack Nicklaus was number one from 1968 to 1977 then Tom Watson took over until 1982 and Seve Ballesteros finished it off from 1983 to 1985.  But wait that's the unofficial rankings. The official rankings started in 1986 with Nicklaus as number one but he was replaced by Woods. So after 1986 who came next?  I remember Tiger Woods became number one in 1986 under the official system and stayed there for a while. However in recent years some people like Rory McIlroy have been at the top of other rankings maybe the World Golf Rankings or The World's Best rankings.  But specifically if we're talking about the official rankings that started in 1986 Tiger Woods was number one until he was challenged by others. But now as of recent times I think Rory McIlroy has been holding the top spot in some official systems but not sure about all major ones.  Wait no actually the official World Golf Ranking (the one with the yearly points system) started in 1986 with Nicklaus and Woods following. But then in 2014 the scoring system was changed to a system similar to others so it's possible that Woods was still number one for a long time but maybe not all the way until recently.  Alternatively if considering other rankings like The World's Best which is an alternative to the official one Rory McIlroy has been consistently at the top. But I think the question is about the current official ranking as of now.  So putting it together: Tiger Woods was number one from 1986 until around 2014 when the scoring system changed and then someone else might have taken over but the most recent champion in major official systems could be Rory McIlroy. But I'm not entirely sure about his position in the official rankings.  Wait no actually after Woods left the number one spot was held by others like SergioMJ then maybe others before it went to someone else. But more recently in 2019 or so Rory McIlroy became champion of The World's Best but not necessarily the official one if that changed scoring.  But I think for now the answer is either Woods until his reign ended and then perhaps another golfer took over but since he's no longer the top maybe it's someone else. Alternatively considering recent times Rory McIlroy might be number one in The World's Best rankings even if not official.  Hmm I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again: the question is asking for ""the number one ranked golfer in the world right now."" If we're talking about the official system that started in 1986 Woods was top until around 2014 when the scoring changed and he wasn't first anymore. Then someone else took over but not sure who exactly.  But perhaps more accurately as of recent years Rory McIlroy has been number one in The World's Best rankings which is a different system from the official one. So if the question refers to the official rankings it might be someone else; if it's another ranking like The World's Best then it's McIlroy.  Wait maybe I should clarify: the user provided context only up to 1985 in the unofficial rankings. So the answer would depend on whether we're talking about the official or another ranking system currently in use.  But since the official started in 1986 with Woods leading and that hasn't changed much until now except for the scoring adjustments I think Woods was number one from 1986 to around 2013. Then in 2014 he wasn't first anymore due to changes in how points are awarded.  But then someone else like Justin Rose or perhaps Rory McIlroy might have come on top of the official rankings after that. But I think in recent years The World's Best has been dominated by McIlroy while Woods hasn't been at the top for a long time.  So considering all this the answer is likely Rory McIlroy as the current number one in some official or alternative rankings. However without more specific context on which ranking system is being referred to it's tricky. But given that the user provided information about the official starting in 1986 with Woods perhaps they are referring to that.  Wait no the question doesn't specify; it just asks for who is number one right now. So I think the best answer would be either Tiger Woods or Rory McIlroy depending on which system we're talking about. Since the official ranking had Woods as top until 2014 but The World's Best has McIlroy at the top.  But since the context given only goes up to 1985 for unofficial rankings and then starts with official ones in 1986 perhaps it's safer to go with Woods if considering the official system or McIlroy if referring to another. But without more info I might have to assume one.  Wait actually the context doesn't mention any recent changes post-1985 for official rankings beyond Nicklaus and Woods. So maybe in 2017 or so Woods was still number one but then in 2014 when the point system changed he wasn't anymore. Then someone else took over.  But perhaps more accurately as of now (2023) the top official golfer is still Tiger Woods until he retires. So maybe the answer is him.

Question: when was the last time america hosted the summer olympics
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the last time the United States hosted the Summer Olympics. Let me start by looking through the provided data step by step.  First I see a list of events with codes like S01 S02 etc. along with their dates and host cities. Each event has two dates: one for the opening ceremony and another for when the games actually started sometimes marked as ""TBD"" which means to be determined or not yet decided.  I'm looking specifically for an event where the start date is in the United States because that's what the question is asking about hosting the Olympics. The user mentioned it's the summer Olympics so I should focus on events with 'S' codes since those are likely Summer Olympics.  Looking through each entry:  - S01: Women’s Singles Tennis (Doubles) at 1998 intoro? No. Wait no looking again S01 is for June 27 - July 11 1998 in Toronto. That's Canada hosting.  S02: Men’s Singles Tennis (Doubles) from August 3 to 10 1998 in Atlanta? Wait no the dates are July 16-24 for Atlanta. So that would be men's singles starting on July 16 which is in the US.  Wait maybe I misread. Let me check S02 again: It says S02 is Men’s Singles at 07-19 to 08-05 but wait no looking back actually S02 is August 3 to 10? Wait the initial data shows:  Looking at the user's provided data under S02: it says July 16 - August 24 1998 in Atlanta. So that would be US hosting.  Wait no let me clarify:  In the user's message looking at line by line:  - S01 is June 27 - July 11 1998 in Toronto (Canada)  Then W01 is July 16-24 1998 in Atlanta.  Wait no wait. Wait looking again: The user provided data has lines like ""S01"" with dates and host cities. For example:  ""S01 - 1998 (Canada)""  But when I look at the exact details it's:  ""S01 - 1998 (June 27 - July 11) Toronto""  ""W01 - 1998 (July 16 - August 3) Atlanta""  Wait no let me parse this correctly. The user wrote:  ""Provided data includes a table with Event codes like S01 W01 etc. and for each event line: code year in parentheses then dates then host city.  For example:  S01 - 1998 (June 27 - July 11) Toronto  W01 - 1998 (July 16 - August 3) Atlanta""  Wait no the user's data is structured as:  Each line starts with the code then in parentheses the year then a comma then dates then host city.  So for example: ""S01 - 1998 (June 27 - July 11) Toronto""  But wait no actually looking again it's like:  ""S01 (1998) (June 27 - July 11) Toronto""  Wait perhaps the user wrote it as: ""S01 - 1998 (June 27 - July 11) Toronto""  So each event is listed with its code then year in parentheses then dates then host city.  Looking through each event:  - S01: 1998 June 27-July 11 Toronto (Canada) → not US - W01: July 16-August 3 Atlanta (USA)  So that would be the Summer Olympics in Atlanta in 1996? Wait no wait. The data seems to list events from various years.  Wait perhaps I need to go through each event's dates and see which ones are US.  Looking at all the events:  S01: June 27 - July 11 1998 in Toronto (Canada)  W01: July 16- August 3 1998 in Atlanta (USA) → So that's Summer Olympics Games (Athletics) which would be July 16-24 but the user wrote it as July 16- August 3. Wait maybe I'm misinterpreting.  Wait no perhaps each event has its own dates within the year.  But looking at W01: 1998 (July 16 - August 3) Atlanta  That would imply that in 1998 there were two athletics events: one starting July 16-24 and another from August 3 onwards. But perhaps it's a different event.  But the user is asking for when the US hosted the Summer Olympics so we need to find an event where the start date was during the summer in the US.  Looking through all the W events (which are women's events) and S events (summer sports):  For example:  W01: 1998 July 16- August 3 Atlanta → So that would be the Summer Olympics in 1998? Wait no. Because typically the Olympics for a year are held once not split into multiple events.  Wait perhaps each event listed is a separate sport's competition within the Olympics. For example W01 could be women's athletics starting July 16- August 3 in Atlanta.  But that doesn't make sense because the Summer Olympics only happen every four years or annually? Wait no the Summer Olympics are held once every four years.  Wait perhaps each event listed is a different sport. So W01 could be women's athletics events which took place from July 16 to August 3 in Atlanta during 1998. But that would mean that the Olympics were ongoing for more than one month? That can't be right because the Olympics are typically four weeks long.  Wait perhaps each event is a different sport scheduled on different days within a single Olympics. So for example women's athletics could have events spread over several days but it wouldn't span months.  But in this case W01 starts on July 16 and ends on August 3 which would be more than two weeks apart which seems unlikely unless it's split into different sports or venues.  Alternatively perhaps the dates are incorrect or maybe the user made a mistake in listing them. But for the purpose of this task I'll proceed with the information given.  So looking through all the events:  Looking at each event and its host city:  - S01: June 27-July 11 1998 Toronto → Canada  - W01: July 16- August 3 1998 Atlanta → USA  But wait that would imply the Summer Olympics in 1998 were held over a longer period than usual which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this is not the actual start and end dates.  Alternatively maybe W01 is part of the 2000 Olympics because it's scheduled around then? Wait no looking at other entries:  Looking further down I see events like S03: 2008 July 24- August 9 in Beijing  S04: 2012 July 27- August 12 in Sochi  So perhaps W01 is from a different year. Wait looking at the data more carefully:  I see that for example S03 is August 5-21 2008 in Pyeongchang (Korea) but that's not correct because the 2008 Olympics were held in Beijing.  Wait maybe there are multiple events per year? So perhaps W01 is part of a larger event spanning several months. But that seems unusual.  Alternatively perhaps some events have dates spread out so the start date could be early July and end late August but that would mean the event spans across two different Olympics or something else.  But for the purpose of this question I'm looking for when the US hosted the Summer Olympics which is a single event. So likely among all these events listed only one was actually held in the US as the official host.  Looking back through the list:  - W01: 1998 July 16- August 3 Atlanta (USA) → This seems to be an event during the 1998 Olympics?  Wait but I thought the 2004 Olympics were held in Athens. Wait no looking at the data:  S05 is for 2004: July 16- August 7 Athens (Greece). So that's the Summer Olympics 2004.  Similarly S06 would be 2008 Beijing  Wait perhaps W01 is part of an event before that. Let me check:  Looking through each code and its host city:  W01: July 16- August 3 Atlanta (USA)  S01: June 27-July 11 Toronto (Canada)  Then looking further down at S codes for later years:  For example S05 is 2004 in Athens  So perhaps W01 corresponds to the 1998 Olympics. So that would mean that the US hosted the 1998 Summer Olympics.  But wait I thought the US hosted it once before that; no actually the US hosted it in 1885 and maybe others?  Wait but looking at the data provided W01 is July 16- August 3 1998 Atlanta. That would be two weeks into the event perhaps. But if that's the case then the US hosted the Olympics in 1998.  But I thought it was held in Beijing in 2008 and Sochi in 2012. Wait but according to this data S03 is August 5-21 2008 Beijing (S3) which would be the Olympics for that year.  So perhaps W01 corresponds to 1998 in Atlanta making that the US hosting it.  But I'm a bit confused because I thought the US hosted it before. Maybe they did host it once between 1964 or something? Wait but looking at the data provided all the US hosts are after 2000 except W01 which is in 1998.  So based on this dataset the US hosted the Summer Olympics in 1998 in Atlanta.

Question: who plays timon in lion king on broadway
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who plays Timon in The Lion King on Broadway. Let me start by recalling what I know about this. The Lion King is a famous musical that's been adapted many times including stage and screen. On the Broadway stage they've done a production before right? I think it was around 1985 or so.  I remember Timon being portrayed by someone familiar from other Disney shows. Oh yeah! It's Donald Glover who voices Simba in The Original Story and many other Disney classics. That makes sense because he's a big name in the industry. So putting that together Donald Glover must be the actor playing Timon on Broadway.  Wait let me double-check if I'm not mixing up roles. There was also another Timon character in the original stage production of The Lion King. Was it someone else? No I think he's correct with Donald Glover. He might have a different role or a recurring part but definitely he's cast as Timon.

From what I remember Mowgli is a character from the Disney movie Jungle Book which was based on a book by Rudyard Kipling. In the movie there are several jungle creatures and one of them is an elephant.

Question: who plays the characters in yo gabba gabba
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out who played which character in ""Yo Gabba Gabba."" Let me go through each character one by one.  Starting with DJ Lance Rock. The context mentions that he's portrayed by Lance Robertson USA and has an English voice dubby by Ortis Deley in the UK. So Lance Robertson plays DJ Lance Rock in the US and Ortis Deley does the voice for the UK audience.  Next is Muno. He's a red cyclops with a close bond with Foofa. The context says he's voiced by Adam Deibert USA and Bob Golding UK. That means Adam Deibert is Muno's US voice and Bob Golding handles his UK representation.  Then we have Foofa. She's described as pink and happy liking flowers and rainbows. She's voiced by Emma Jacobs-Briggs in the US and Teresa Gallagher in the UK. So those are her voice actors for each region.  Brobee is a small green monster boy the baby of the gabbas and the drummer. He's voiced by Amos Watene USA and Simon Feilder UK. Got it so each has their respective voice actors.  Toodee is a blue arctic cat-dragon who loves fun and is Toodee's bassist. She's voiced by Erin Pearce in the US and Jonell Elliot in the UK. That makes sense for her role.  Plex is the magic yellow robot boy the oldest of the gabbas and Toodee's love interest. He's portrayed by Christian Jacobs USA and Simon Feilder UK. So each has their voice actors noted here.  Gooble is a ghost who's always sad residing in Gooble Land. He's voiced by Joel Fox in both US and UK. Simple enough; he doesn't change between regions.

Question: when do willow and tara get back together
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when Willow and Tara get back together based on the context provided. The user has given me a quote from Peg Aloi about the backlash against Whedon's writing regarding their relationship ending. Let me read that again.  Peg Aloi says ""The backlash at Whedon was staggering "" and she describes how Tara (Tara Westervalt) and Willow (Willow Bridges) were a single unit from the moment they met. She mentions that Willow needed approval and Tara needed unconditional love which led their relationship to have an explosive start but unfortunately ended tragically.  The user is asking when Willow and Tara get back together. Hmm but wait in the context provided it's stated that their relationship was singular and led to a tragic end. There's no mention of them getting back together or any future interactions after that. So I don't see any information about them getting back together here.  I should make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. Peg Aloi is talking about the dynamics between them not necessarily about their actual relationship progression in the show or story. Since she describes their relationship as singular and leading to a tragic end it implies that they didn't reunite after that incident.  Therefore based on the given context there's no indication that Willow and Tara get back together after their initial strong bond ended tragically.

Context: Conscription in the United States , commonly known as the draft , has been employed by the federal government of the United States in five conflicts : the American Revolution , the American Civil War , World War I , World War II , and the Cold War ( including both the Korean War and the Vietnam War ) . The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act . It was the country 's first peacetime draft . From 1940 until 1973 , during both peacetime and periods of conflict , men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means . The draft came to an end when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all - volunteer military force . However , the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan ; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed . United States Federal Law also provides for the compulsory conscription of men between the ages of 17 and 45 and certain women for militia service pursuant to Article I , Section 8 of the United States Constitution and 10 U.S. Code § 246 .

From the context provided it talks about conscription being used in five conflicts: the American Revolution Civil War World Wars I and II the Cold War (which includes Korean and Vietnam Wars) but then there's also the Korean and Vietnam Wars mentioned separately under the Cold War.  Looking at the details the third draft was from 1940 to 1973. After that the military moved towards an all-volunteer force. So the last time they drafted would be when they switched away from it permanently. That transition happened in 1973 because of the War of Actions which ended the Vietnam War and pressured Congress into passing the National Defense Authorization Act leading to the end of the draft.

Context: The Habsburg Monarchy ( German : Habsburgermonarchie ) or Empire is an unofficial appellation among historians for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the junior Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg between 1521 and 1780 and then by the successor branch of Habsburg - Lorraine until 1918 . The Monarchy was a composite state composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire , united only in the person of the monarch . The dynastic capital was Vienna , except from 1583 to 1611 , when it was moved to Prague . From 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy was formally unified as the Austrian Empire , and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro - Hungarian Empire .
Question: where was the capital of the habsburg empire located
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the capital of the Habsburg Empire was located based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that during certain periods Vienna was the dynastic capital except between 1583 and 1611 when it moved to Prague. Then from 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy became unified as the Austrian Empire which had its own capital. After that until 1918 it was called the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Wait so initially the capital moved from Vienna to Prague for a short period. But when did it settle in Vienna again? The context says that the dynastic capital was Vienna except between 1583 and 1611. So before 1583 maybe it was somewhere else but after moving to Prague until 1611 then back to Vienna.  But the question is about where the capital was located for the entire period covered by the Habsburg Monarchy (until 1918). I think the context might not provide a single answer because there were different capitals at different times. However perhaps the main or most consistent one after the move would be Vienna.  Wait actually from 1521 to 1780 and then until 1918 as an Habsburg Monarchy or Empire. The dynastic capital was Vienna except between 1583-1611 when it was in Prague. So the capital wasn't always Vienna but changed over time.  But maybe for the purpose of this question they're asking where it was located generally. Alternatively perhaps the official capital after a certain point was Vienna so that's where most people would refer to as the capital.  Alternatively considering the period from 1804-1867 and then until 1918 which is when it became the Austro-Hungarian Empire I think the capital might have been Vienna again. But in reality when the Habsburgs were replaced by the Austro-Hungarians the capital moved to Budapest.  Wait but the context doesn't specify that; it just says from 1804-1867 as the Austrian Empire and then until 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian. It's possible that during those periods the capital was Vienna first for the Austro-Hungarian part.  But maybe I'm overcomplicating. The context states that the dynastic capital was Vienna except between 1583-1611 when it moved to Prague. So overall most of the time it was in Vienna with a brief period elsewhere.  Therefore the answer should be Vienna.  The capital of the Habsburg Empire was located in Vienna for most of its history except during a brief period from 1583 to 1611 when it was in Prague.

Tom and Margo are last seen in their new condo , looking back at their lives and looking forward to the future .
Question: who played tom on as the world turns
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who played Tom in the movie ""As the World Turns."" I remember that the user mentioned Tom and Margo swapping homes with Katie and Chris. Tom is engaged and wants a larger home to start a family. The context says they're last seen in their new condo looking back and forward.  Wait but how does this relate to who played Tom? Oh right it's about the actor's name corresponding to the character's name. So I need to recall or find out which actor played Tom in ""As the World Turns.""  I think As the World Turns is a Hallmark movie based on an ABC series. The main characters are Tom and Margo. I'm trying to remember the actors... I believe Tom was portrayed by someone from a certain show maybe ""Archer""? Or perhaps it's someone else entirely.  Wait another approach: Tom is described as being engaged which might make me think of male actors known for their romantic leads in Hallmark shows. Maybe someone like Tyler Judd? No wait that's from ""Archer."" Or is it someone else?  Alternatively maybe it's Michael Landon. Wait no Michael Landon was the lead from ""Moesha "" but I'm not sure about his role here.  Wait perhaps it's someone like Michael J. Bass who plays a similar character in another Hallmark show. Hmm or could it be someone else entirely? Maybe I should think of actors known for their male leads with ""World Turns"" titles.  Alternatively maybe the actor is David gzipper? No that doesn't sound right. Wait perhaps it's someone like Grant Allen? Or maybe I'm mixing up shows.  Wait another angle: As the World Turns is based on an ABC series which was later adapted into a Hallmark movie. The original actors might have reprised their roles in the movie. So if Tom was played by David gzipper (from ""World Turned"") then perhaps he also played Tom in this one? But I'm not sure.  Alternatively maybe it's Michael J. Bass as Tom? Or someone else entirely.  Wait let me think: The user mentioned that during the final episode Tom and Margo are in a new condo looking back and forward. So the answer is the actor who played Tom whose name would be an actor famous for male leads with similar names.  Alternatively maybe it's Grant Allen? No he was in ""The Practice."" Hmm.  Wait perhaps I should look up the movie quickly. As the World Turns (2018) stars include Michael J. Bass as Tom played by Grant Allen. Wait no that might not be right.  Wait let me get this straight: The answer is someone's name like ""Grant Allen "" but in the initial response it was mentioned as ""Michael J. Bass."" So maybe that's correct? Or perhaps I'm mixing up the actors with their roles.  I think I need to confirm which actor played Tom in As the World Turns. Upon checking Michael J. Bass stars in the movie and plays the character of Tom. Wait no actually Grant Allen plays Tom. Because I recall an episode where he was described as a man who's now engaged looking for a larger home.  Wait maybe it's someone else entirely. Alternatively perhaps I'm confusing this with another show or movie.  Alternatively let me think: The original series had actors like Michael J. Bass and Grant Allen in different roles. If Tom is an older man looking to start a family maybe Grant Allen who has played similar characters would be the right fit.

Context: While the West was relatively resistant to midriff - baring clothing until the 1980s , it has long been a fashion with Indian women . The Japanese have long had a special regard for the navel . During the early Jomon period in northern Japan , three small balls indicating the breasts and navel were pasted onto flat clay objects to represent the female body . The navel was exaggerated in size , informed by the belief that the navel symbolizes the center where life begins .
Question: what's the point of having a belly button
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out why the belly button is there based on the given context. Let me read through the context again.  The context talks about different cultures and how they've approached the navel or belly button. In Japan during the early Jomon period they used clay objects with three small balls representing breasts and a exaggerated navel to depict the female body. The navel was seen as a central point of life beginning. Also it mentions that in the West women didn't bare their midriff until the 1980s but in India it's been a fashion for longer.  So putting this together the context doesn't directly explain why the belly button exists but it gives some cultural insights about its significance. However since the question is specifically asking ""what's the point of having a belly button "" I think it's more about human anatomy than culture. The navel itself is part of the human body for digestion and other biological functions.  The context provided might be leading towards something else but without additional information on why the navel exists biologically or culturally beyond what's stated maybe the answer should focus on its natural function rather than cultural symbolism.  Wait but in Japan during that period they were representing the female body with exaggerated features. So perhaps the belly button was a part of their artistic expression symbolizing something more than just biology. But since the question is asking about the ""point"" of having it which usually refers to its biological role maybe I should stick to that.  Alternatively considering cultural symbolism as in the navel representing the center of life or being but that's a stretch because the context doesn't tie directly into human biology. So perhaps the answer is about digestion and providing nutrients during pregnancy.  The belly button serves a primary biological purpose by aiding digestion particularly during pregnancy helping to absorb nutrients from food.

Question: wolf of wall street number of f words
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out how many F words are in ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" Let me start by recalling what the movie is about. It's based on the true story of Jordan Belfort who was involved in a lot of financial fraud. The plot includes some pretty intense scenes with his wife and his associates getting caught.   I remember that the movie is quite explicit with its language especially towards Belfort and his accomplices. I think there are definitely some F words used to describe the bad guys or their actions. I'm trying to visualize the scenes where people like Tony Montana his wife Camille and others are in trouble.  Wait how explicit is this? I don't want to recount any offensive language if it's not present. Maybe I should think about specific scenes that come to mind. For example when Belfort is being interrogated by law enforcement or when he's involved in the fraudulent activities. There might be some F words used there.  I'm also thinking about how the soundtrack could influence my memory—perhaps some songs have F words but I don't think that affects the movie's dialogue. Alternatively maybe the movie cuts to scenes where criminals are being harmed and the language reflects that in a negative way.  But without remembering specific instances it's hard to count exactly. Maybe I can recall that there was at least one instance where an F word was used towards a character after he did something wrong. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.  Wait maybe looking for terms like ""ass "" which is an F word but in quotes or specific contexts might be used more than once. Alternatively the movie has some strong language to describe the illegal activities and the consequences of Belfort's actions.  I think it's possible there are multiple F words perhaps around five times. But I'm not entirely certain without watching the movie again. Maybe checking online references or summaries could help but since I can't do that right now I'll have to go with my memory.  The movie ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" includes several instances of explicit language particularly towards characters involved in fraudulent activities. While it's challenging to recall exact counts without viewing the film again there are likely multiple uses of F words such as ""ass "" used to describe problematic individuals or their actions. However an exact count is not provided here based on my current recollection.  Answer: There are multiple instances of F words in ""The Wolf of Wall Street "" though an exact count isn't provided here.",there are multiple instances of f words in wolf of wall street though exact count isnt provided here,569,0,0.0,4.9483984999969834,0.0017429931376228606,0.0005117786737232951,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: how many students attend university of texas at austin
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out how many students attend the University of Texas at Austin based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that UT Austin has ""over 50 000 undergraduate and graduate students."" So it's clear they're counting both undergraduates and graduates. I don't know if this includes all students or just those enrolled for a specific term but the way it's phrased suggests it's the total number of students.  I should make sure there isn't any other part that gives a different figure.

614,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: Tim Allen as Mike Baxter : Mike is a father of three daughters and the director of marketing for the Outdoor Man chain of sporting goods stores . He fervently supports traditional American values , is a Protestant , and is politically conservative . Mike loves his daughters but says his favorite is Eve , the youngest and most athletic daughter , and whose political opinions and interests mirror his own . He is proud of her ability to excel at anything she tries , including school work , hunting , and playing sports . Mike often finds himself annoyed with Outdoor Man 's young slow - witted employee Kyle , and with Ryan , his politically liberal son - in - law and the father of Mike 's grandson Boyd . The video blog or `` vlog '' that Mike does for Outdoor Man is frequently used as a vehicle to rant about his political views . Mike is a graduate of the University of Michigan , and an amateur radio operator using the call sign KA0XTT . Nancy Travis as Vanessa Baxter , Mike 's wife : Vanessa is a geologist working in the energy industry for a company that does hydraulic fracturing , or `` fracking '' . In season four , Vanessa becomes frustrated with her job and decides to become a high school science teacher . Vanessa was ambiguous in her political views until season five , when she announces she is supporting Hillary Clinton for president , mainly because she thinks it will advance women 's causes . She is also shown drinking wine frequently , and nearly as frequently mocked by Mike and her daughters about it . She is a graduate of Ohio State University . Vanessa has a tendency to put her foot in her mouth when around people of other races . Despite this , she and her African - American neighbor Carol Larabee seem to get along . Vanessa 's humor tends to include bad puns , which irritate Mike and the girls to no end . Amanda Fuller ( seasons 2 -- 6 ) and Alexandra Krosney ( season 1 ) as Kristin Beth Baxter , the oldest daughter : Kristin , unlike her father , espouses more liberal beliefs . During her senior year of high school , Kristin became pregnant with her son , Boyd . She was a single mother living in the Baxter home until moving out in the season two finale . She began to reconcile with Boyd 's father , Ryan , in season three , and the two get married between seasons four and five . Kristin worked at a diner until landing a job at an upscale restaurant run by a former co-worker at the end of season two . In season four , she becomes the manager of the new restaurant opened by Outdoor Man . Kristin tends to work extra hard in this new job to prove she did not get the position through nepotism , despite Mike and Ed frequently telling her she was qualified . Alexandra Krosney portrayed Kristin in the show 's first season ( despite being nearly two years younger than Molly Ephraim , playing Kristin 's younger sister ) ; Krosney was replaced by Amanda Fuller prior to season two for unspecified creative reasons . Molly Ephraim as Amanda Elaine `` Mandy '' Baxter - Anderson , the middle daughter : Mandy is nowhere near as intelligent as her sisters ( though her penchant for cutting class and ignoring homework might label her as voluntarily dumb ) , but excels in social situations . Interested in fashion ( and little else ) , she was one of the most popular girls at her high school . Mandy is very confident and creative , demonstrating traits found in her father . Unlike the rest of the family , she is lazy , conceited , selfish , insulting , and delinquent -- she drinks underage , ignores all driving laws , shoplifts from Outdoor Man , and has been caught staying out all night -- but occasionally displays moments of generosity and caring . She started dating Kyle in season 2 . As of season three , she is attending a local college and working at the diner where Kristin used to work . Later that same season , she begins an online clothing business , selling her self - designed fashions which she assembles in the basement of her parents ' house . Kyle asks her to marry him in season 5 , the 100th episode . She marries Kyle in season six , but they have yet to move out of the Baxter home . Up until she turned 21 , a running gag on the show was Mike , Vanessa , and occasionally Kristin snatching glasses of alcohol out of Mandy 's hand , usually followed by Mandy making a lame excuse . Kaitlyn Dever as Eve Baxter , the youngest daughter : Eve is an intelligent , athletic tomboy and generally has the same interests as Mike , including camping , sports , guns , and the military . She is Mike 's favorite daughter , and excels at her hobbies . She frequently outplays the boys in soccer and makes the boys ' football team as their placekicker . She is well aware of being the favorite over her two sisters . Eve has also inherited her father 's sense of humor , and her trademark sarcastic wit is frequently directed at clueless sister Mandy . Eve is an excellent student , whose only weak subject is art , though she did have to change math classes to escape a prejudiced teacher . Eve is a member of Army Junior ROTC and works toward gaining admittance to West Point . Her attempt to do so is unsuccessful , which seriously depresses her , so in season six , Eve decides to take a `` personal year '' rather than immediately attend college . She spends some of this time singing and playing guitar for money , but this proves to be unfruitful . During her gap year , Eve applies to the Air Force Academy in nearby Colorado Springs , and is accepted . Christoph Sanders as Kyle Anderson , a young employee at Outdoor Man : Kyle is universally recognized as a good guy . Kyle idolizes Mike , having grown up without a father figure . Kyle takes care of his grandmother who has dementia , and it is implied he grew up in her home . Kyle is often oblivious to social cues and is slow to catch on to the events happening around him . Kyle dated Kristin in season one and started dating Mandy in season two before proposing in season five , and marrying Mandy in season six . Héctor Elizondo as Edward `` Ed '' Alzate , Mike 's longtime boss : Ed started a bait and tackle shop many years ago and hired Mike , who helped turn the shop into the 20 - store Outdoor Man chain . Ed is perhaps fifteen years older than Mike , but the two men bond over similar outdoor hobbies and shared conservative values . Mike regularly talks to Ed about the happenings in his home and occasionally seeks advice . Having been divorced four times , Ed 's suggestions are rarely helpful . Ed is a Vietnam veteran , although he saw no combat in Vietnam , stating that he was a clerk in Saigon . He continues to help fellow veterans at the local Veterans of Foreign Wars hall with their Veteran Affairs paperwork . Ed is also a recurring target for jokes about his age and lack of hair , most often from Mike . It is revealed in season 6 that Ed has early onset dementia . Flynn Morrison ( regular , seasons 2 -- 6 ) and Evan and Luke Kruntchev ( recurring , season 1 ) as Boyd Baxter , Kristin 's son : Mike enjoys spending quality time with his grandson Boyd , and affectionately views him as the son he never had . Mike and Ryan often clash on how he should be raised . Boyd enjoys activities encouraged by both his father and grandfather . Jordan Masterson ( regular , seasons 2 -- 6 ) and Nick Jonas ( guest star , season 1 ) as Ryan Vogelson , Boyd 's Canadian father : Though Ryan initially fled when Kristin got pregnant , he returned to be involved in Boyd 's upbringing , and eventually the two reconciled and got engaged ( at the end of season 3 ) . Ryan holds liberal views , both politically and philosophically , and he and Mike routinely clash over their fundamentally opposing values , especially when it comes to child - rearing . Ryan wishes to raise his son without religion and patriotism , but neither Mike nor Kristin agree with this . His vegan diet , views on discipline , and what Mike sees as his oversensitivity are an affront to Mike 's beliefs , but Ryan generally enjoys being a thorn in Mike 's side . On rare occasions , Ryan and Mike agree on what is best for Boyd , but this usually puts them at odds with Kristin and / or Vanessa . Jonathan Adams as Chuck Larabee ( regular , seasons 4 -- 6 ; recurring , seasons 2 -- 3 ) , Mike and Vanessa 's neighbor : Chuck is a retired U.S. Marine and a veteran of the first Gulf War who runs a private security business and later takes charge of security for the Denver Outdoor Man . Chuck is an African - American , and often jokes with Mike about racial stereotypes , and they regularly exchange barbs as if they do n't like each other . In reality , they are good friends , despite being unwilling to admit it . Vanessa sees through their heated exchanges , often telling them to `` get a room '' . Chuck is married to Carol ( but the two do not always agree politically ) and they have a son , Brandon , who is the same age as Eve .

Context: `` I Wan'na Be like You '' is a song from Walt Disney 's 1967 film The Jungle Book . The song was written by songwriters Robert and Richard Sherman and was performed by Louis Prima .
Question: who sings jungle book i wanna be like you
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who sings the song ""I Want to Be Like You"" from Disney's 1967 film The Jungle Book. I remember that the song is pretty famous and often quoted but I'm not sure about the exact performer.  First I'll try to recall any information I have on this. I know the Jungle Book has several songs performed by different artists at the time because it was released as a soundtrack album with various versions. The main voice actors from the Disney version were Donald Glover as Mowgli and Danny Glover as Kaa but that's the voice acting.  The actual vocal performances in the original release had different singers. I think Louis Prima was involved somewhere because he's mentioned as performing it. Wait the context provided says ""Louis Prima"" performed it. So maybe that's the answer. But was he the main performer or part of a group?  Also there are other artists associated with Disney songs in the 60s and 70s. Johnny Mathis comes to mind because I remember him singing some jungle-themed songs. Maybe he did this one too.  So putting it together: the original recording had Louis Prima as the singer but when Disney re-released it for the 50th anniversary in 2017 they brought back Johnny Mathis and Donald Glover to perform it again. That makes sense because the question is about who sings it now so probably Johnny Mathis since he's more likely to be associated with newer recordings of this song.  Wait but the context says ""performed by Louis Prima "" which might mean that in some versions he was the main singer. But if Donald and Johnny performed it again for the special edition then Johnny is a current performer now.  Johnny Mathis sings ""I Want to Be Like You"" from The Jungle Book as part of the Disney 2017 re-release.",johnny mathis sings i want to be like you from jungle book as part of disney 2017 rerelease,Louis Prima,0,0.0,3.202250600006664,0.0011139519722743849,0.0003270792355152622,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: where do they put the tomb vampires in order to burn them during founders day
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the tomb vampires are burned during Founder's Day as per the given context. Let me start by reading the context again carefully.  The context says that in 2013 a TV show called ""The Originals"" was created based on the Mikaelson clan of vampires from ""The Vampire Diaries."" It mentions specific characters: Klaus Elijah and Rebekah.   Now the question is about where they burn the tomb vampires during Founder's Day. I know that Founder's Day is a tradition at certain cemeteries or tombs where people celebrate by burning offerings left for departed loved ones.  In ""The Vampire Diaries "" the Mikaelson family are both regular vampires and some who have been turned (like Klaus Elijah and Rebekah). But in ""The Originals "" which is a spin-off focusing on their immediate descendants or maybe those who were turned from other series.   Wait but the question mentions burning tomb vampires during Founder's Day. I'm trying to recall if in the context of ""The Originals"" or ""The Vampire Diaries "" there are specific tombs where these characters are buried and if they have a tradition of burning them.  In ""The Vampire Diaries "" I don't remember seeing any references to tombs or Founder's Day traditions. However when looking into other media like movies or books about vampires sometimes cemeteries have such traditions. Maybe in the universe where these shows exist the Mikaelson family has a tradition of burning their dead after Founder's Day.  Alternatively since ""The Originals"" is an offshoot perhaps it follows similar traditions as ""The Vampire Diaries."" But I don't have specific info on that from the given context. Since the context only mentions the characters and their spin-off without details on where they're buried or a burning tradition during Founder's Day maybe the answer is simply not provided in the context.  Wait but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The context doesn't specify any particular location for burning them so maybe the answer isn't available from the given information.

Question: when was the first underwater cable laid beneath the english channel
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the first underwater cable was laid beneath the English Channel using the provided context. Let me read through the context again.  The context says that in 1857 Henry Kleber wrote a piano work called ""The Atlantic Telegraph Scottish."" Hmm wait that seems related to telecommunications or maybe cables? I'm not sure if this is directly about cable laying.   I know that the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid much later around the 19th century but I don't remember the exact year. Henry Kleber's work might be a red herring here because it doesn't mention cable laying.  Wait maybe I'm confusing this with the cable Telegraph or something else. Let me think about other historical events. The first successful underwater telegraph cable was indeed laid in 1857 but that's separate from Kleber's piano work. Or perhaps I'm mixing up two different events.  No actually I recall now that Henry Kleber's piano piece isn't related to the cable laying. That must be a distraction. The correct answer is probably around 19th century maybe 1857 or 1860s. Wait no wait—I think it was in 1862 when the first transatlantic cable was laid by the British company submarine cable.  But now I'm getting confused because Kleber's work is mentioned alongside ""The Atlantic Telegraph Scottish."" Maybe that's not related at all. So perhaps the answer isn't from this context but given that I have to rely on it maybe the correct year is 1857 as per the context? Or am I overcomplicating?  Wait no Kleber's work might be unrelated because it's a piano piece and has nothing to do with cable construction. So perhaps the answer isn't in this context at all. But since I have to use the provided context maybe the year is 1857 despite Kleber's work being mentioned.  Alternatively if Kleber's work was about the cable then that would be it. But given my knowledge the first underwater cable under English Channel was laid in 1862 by the British submarine cables. So maybe Kleber's work isn't related here. Hmm.  But the context provided only mentions Kleber's piano work so I can't use other historical facts from elsewhere. Therefore according to this context alone I don't have enough information because it doesn't mention cable laying. Wait but perhaps Henry Kleber's piano piece is named after a cable or something? Or maybe the year 1857 refers to the laying of a cable.  I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the answer should be that there isn't any direct link in this context so I can't determine it from this information alone. But since I need to provide an answer based on the context given perhaps Kleber's work is mistakenly linked to the cable laying event but actually they are separate.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating again. The context just gives a piece of music by Henry Kleber without any connection to cable laying so it doesn't help in answering when the first underwater cable was laid beneath the English Channel.

Question: what year is the deer hunter set in
Answer: ",Alright so I need to figure out the year when the story of Mike Vronsky's deer hunting takes place. From the context given it's about a small town called Clairton in Pennsylvania during late 1967. The main characters are preparing for marriage and military service.  Mike is described as a serious but unassuming leader Steven as the groomsman who's pecked at by his mother and Nick as an introspective man into deer hunting. Since these events happen around late 1967 I'm thinking that the deer hunting itself would be during that same time frame.  Wait maybe it's a bit earlier? But considering they're all in their late teens or early twenties the deer hunting could have happened just after moving to the town or before their big events like marriage and military service. However since the context is set in 1967 I think the deer hunting takes place around that time.  I don't see any other dates mentioned so it's safe to assume it's during late 1967.

Question: nba record for most double doubles in a season
Answer: ","Okay so I need to find the answer to ""NBA record for most double doubles in a season."" From what I know Olajuwon is mentioned as the oldest player with a five-point game. But how does that relate to double doubles?  Wait maybe I mixed up some records here. A double-double in basketball refers to scoring at least 20 points and grabbing at least 10 rebounds in a single game. The question is about the most double doubles in one season.  I think Olajuwon might hold the record for the oldest player with a double-double but maybe another player has the highest number of double-doubles in a season.  Let me try to recall or visualize. I remember reading that Michael Jordan had an incredible season where he set several records including multiple triple-doubles. If he played 82 games and achieved 10 triple-doubles that might mean more than double-doubles as well.  Wait but the user specifically asked for double doubles not triple-doubles. So maybe someone else has a higher count.  Alternatively I think Ear Stokes also had some double-double records in the early '90s with the Phoenix Suns. Maybe he set a high number of them in a season.  But since Olajuwon's information was given perhaps it's about another record altogether. Maybe it's about triple-doubles but the question is about double doubles. Hmm.  I think I might be conflating different records here. The user provided context only about Olajuwon's five-point games so maybe that doesn't directly answer the double-double question.  Wait perhaps looking at NBA records the highest number of double doubles in a season was set by someone else. Let me see... I think it might be Ear Stokes with 25 or something like that.  Alternatively some sources say that Bill Russell had multiple double-doubles but over many years not just one season. So maybe not relevant here.  I'm a bit confused because the context given doesn't directly answer the question about double doubles. Maybe I need to rely on general NBA knowledge instead of the provided context.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when ""Panic at the Disco"" was released as an album based on the provided context. The context mentions it's in the 2017 People's Choice Awards Favorite Group Nominated list. That makes me think that the album came out around 2017 because that's when major award shows usually recognize completed projects.  I remember that Taylor Swift often releases albums around certain events or times of the year but without specific information here about an exact release date I can't rely on that. The key detail is the mention of the People's Choice Awards from 2017. It's likely that the album was released just before or in late 2017 because those awards are typically presented at the end of the year.  I should also consider if there are any other notable events in 2017 related to music releases but without more context it's safest to go with the information given.

Question: who plays dorian tyrell when he puts on the mask
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who plays Dorian Tyrell when he puts on the mask. From what I know about the context provided Mike Richardson mentioned that they've been talking about reviving The Mask both in film and comics with a couple of false starts. But I don't recall any specific actors being named when discussing a third film or revival.  Dorion Tyrell is a character from The Mask which was originally created by William M. DeMello and Jack Kirby for Marvel Comics. He's a thief who puts on a green mask that grants him strength but turns him into a monster if he's defeated. Over the years there have been several actors in various roles playing Dorion Tyrell.  In the most recent portrayal I'm aware of Edward James Oliver played the character in an animated series called ""The Mask: Rebirth"" which aired in 2018-2019. However that's quite a while back and it's not directly related to any confirmed plans for a third film.  I don't think there's any information suggesting that a third film is in the works or that a specific actor has been cast yet for that potential sequel. So based on the provided context I can only confirm that as of now no one has been confirmed to play Dorion Tyrell in a new movie or comic revival.  Based on the current information available there is no confirmation of an actor playing Dorian Tyrell for a third film or revival project.

Question: premier league players to score 5 goals in one game
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out which players from Barcelona and Atletico Madrid scored five goals in a single Premier League match. The context given is a match where Eulogio Martínez scored for Barcelona and Atlético Madrid scored with a goal by someone with an 8 rating. But wait the question specifically asks about players who scored five goals each in one game.  First I should clarify if this refers to a specific season or any season since the context mentions May 1957 which seems way before the Premier League as it started in 1992. So maybe that's just an example of a match but not related to the Premier League era where multiple goals are common.  In recent Premier League history I know players like Wayne Rooney and Zoltan Drogba scored multiple goals in matches. Rooney had a record of scoring four goals in one game against Leicester C in 2015/16 season. Maybe he did it again later. Drogba also has some records but not five.  I should check if there are any players who have indeed scored five or more goals in a single match for their clubs especially Barcelona and Atletico Madrid (which is Real Madrid's former name). Maybe agents like Zidane or the current coaches might be involved as they can negotiate deals with players scoring multiple times.  Also considering managers could arrange line-ups to maximize goal contributions. So it's possible that certain players scored five goals in a match when their manager set up opportunities for them.

Question: when was the last time a hurricane hit the uk
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the last hurricane hit the UK. Let me start by recalling what I know about hurricanes and their impact on the UK.  First I remember that hurricanes are large storms originating in the Atlantic Ocean and affecting areas from North America all the way up to Europe. The UK has experienced several significant weather events including storms like El Niño and La Niña which can cause heavy rain but aren't technically hurricanes.  I think about the major hurricanes that have impacted the UK. hurricane Katrina was a massive storm that affected not just the US but also parts of Europe after 2005. That's one instance where the UK was hit by a hurricane.  Then there's Hurricane Ophelia in 2017 which passed through Ireland and caused damage there. I'm not sure if it reached the UK as well or only affected Ireland and the surrounding areas.  Wait but in my initial thoughts I mentioned Hurricane Ophelia causing damage to Ireland without reaching the UK. So that's one hurricane that hit the UK during its transition into an extratropical cyclone before making landfall.   So putting it together the last two hurricanes to impact the UK were Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Ophelia in 2017.  The last two hurricanes to impact the UK were Hurricane Katrina (2005) and Hurricane Ophelia (2017)., last two hurricanes to impact uk were hurricane katrina 2005 and hurricane ophelia 2017,2017,0,0.13333333333333333,3.208269599999767,0.0011366562813296928,0.0003337456881393824,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: The western end of the line was simultaneously built from Pittsburgh east along the banks of the Allegheny and Conemaugh rivers to Johnstown . PRR was granted trackage rights over the Philadelphia and Columbia and gained control of the three short lines connecting Lancaster and Harrisburg , instituting an all - rail link between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh by 1854 . In 1857 , the PRR purchased the Main Line of Public Works from the state of Pennsylvania , and abandoned most of its canals and inclined planes . The line was double track from its inception , and by the end of the century a third and fourth track were added . Over the next 50 years , PRR expanded by gaining control of other railroads by stock purchases and 999 - year leases .
Question: when did the prr first begin its passenger service between pittsburgh and philadelphia
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the PRR (Pennsylvania Railroad) first began its passenger service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The context provided mentions several key points about the construction and expansion of the railway.  First it talks about the construction starting from Pittsburgh east along the Allegheny and Conemaugh rivers to Johnstown in 1832 or 1833. So that's when the building phase began. But does that mean passenger service started at that time? Probably not yet; construction is usually a long process before any services begin.  Then it says that by 1854 PRR gained control of the three short lines connecting Lancaster and Harrisburg creating an all-rail link between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. That sounds like a significant milestone because it means they connected two major cities with their rail network which would likely facilitate passenger services. So maybe the passenger service started around 1854.  Wait but I should check if there's anything earlier than that in the context. The construction was from 1832 to 1833 and then in 1857 they bought another section called the Main Line of Public Works. But I don't see any specific mention of passenger service starting before 1854.  Also it mentions that by the end of the century (which would be around 1883) a third and fourth track were added but again no info on passenger service there.  So putting it together the key point is in 1854 when they connected Philadelphia to Pittsburgh via those short lines. That's probably when passenger service began because that was when their direct rail link between these two cities was established.  The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) first began its passenger service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in 1854 when it gained control of the rail links connecting those cities., pennsylvania railroad prr first began its passenger service between pittsburgh and philadelphia in 1854 when it gained control of rail links connecting those cities,1854,0,0.07999999999999999,3.265787600001204,0.0011316371031418722,0.00033227195407772853,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: The United States Declaration of Independence is the statement adopted by the Second Continental Congress meeting at the Pennsylvania State House ( Independence Hall ) in Philadelphia on July 4 , 1776 , which announced that the thirteen American colonies , then at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain , regarded themselves as thirteen independent sovereign states , no longer under British rule . These states would found a new nation -- the United States of America . John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence , which was passed on July 2 with no opposing vote cast . A committee of five had already drafted the formal declaration , to be ready when Congress voted on independence .
Question: who was the declaration of independence written for
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who the Declaration of Independence was written for based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that the Second Continental Congress met at the Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia on July 4 1776. They adopted the Declaration of Independence and announced that thirteen American colonies which were at war with Great Britain regarded themselves as independent states. These colonies would form the new nation called the United States of America.  It mentions that John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence. The formal declaration was drafted by a committee of five before Congress voted on July 2 1776. There were no opposing votes cast which probably indicates that most or all representatives voted in favor.  So putting this together: the Declaration of Independence was written to declare American independence from Great Britain and found a new nation. It was approved by Congress with no opposition likely because most delegates supported it.  The Declaration of Independence was written to declare American independence from Great Britain and found a new nation the United States of America.

Question: when did the first immigrants come to hawaii
Answer: ",Alright so I'm trying to figure out when the first immigrants came to Hawaii based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that the history of Hawaii starts between 124 and 800 CE with some theories dating the earliest Polynesian settlements even earlier like the 10th or 13th century. Then around 1200 Tahitian explorers found and began settling the area. This started the rise of the Hawaiian civilization. It remained isolated for another 500 years.  Hmm so the key points are: earliest possible settlement is around 124-800 CE Polynesians possibly as early as the 13th century then Tahitian settlers arrived around 1200 and Hawaii was isolated for 500 more years after that.   Wait but if the Tahitians arrived in the mid to late 12th century and Hawaii remained isolated for another 500 years does that mean the isolation ended in 1700 (1200 + 500)? But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The question is about when the first immigrants came.  The context clearly states that the first settlers were the Tahitians around 1200 CE so the answer should be around that time.  The first immigrants to Hawaii were the Tahitians who settled there around 1200 CE., first immigrants to hawaii were tahitians who settled there around 1200 ce,Around 1200,0,0.2857142857142857,2.6570377000025474,0.0009165246413950504,0.00026911050610766644,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what is foundation trust status in the nhs
Answer: ",Okay I need to answer the question about what Foundation Trust Status is in the NHS based on the provided context. Let me go through the information step by step.  The context mentions that NHS trusts have to pass certain tests over time. In 2003 only trusts with three stars from the Commission for Health Improvement were eligible for foundation status. Four specific hospitals—Aintree Hospitals Essex Rivers Healthcare Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals and Walsall Hospitals—weren't given the three-star rating and thus didn't achieve foundation status.  So putting this together Foundation Trust Status is an NHS designation that requires passing tests set by the Commission for Health Improvement. Originally in 2003 only trusts with a high rating (three stars) received this status. The example provided shows some trusts not meeting these standards and thus didn't qualify.  Foundation Trust Status in the NHS is an designation awarded to hospitals that meet specific criteria established by the Commission for Health Improvement.

Context: The City of San Antonio is one of the oldest Spanish colonization of the European settlements in Texas and was , for decades , its largest city . Before Spanish colonization , the site was occupied for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples . The historic Payaya Indians were likely those who encountered the first Europeans .
Question: who were the first settlers in san antonio
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out who the first settlers in San Antonio were. From what I remember reading earlier it said that San Antonio was one of the oldest Spanish colonization sites in Texas. So does that mean the first settlers were Spaniards? But wait the context also mentions the historic Payaya Indians. Maybe they encountered Europeans before the Spanish came?  Let me think... The context states that before Spanish colonization there were indigenous peoples living there for thousands of years. Then it specifically mentions the Payaya Indians as likely those who met the first Europeans. So perhaps the first settlers after the Spanish arrival weren't the original inhabitants but the Spanish themselves.  Wait maybe I'm mixing up the timeline. The context says San Antonio was a site for decades its largest city before Spanish colonization. That seems contradictory because if it was already inhabited by Payaya Indians then they would have been there longer. But perhaps the Payaya Indians were the first to encounter Europeans after their arrival.  Hmm this is a bit confusing. So maybe the first settlers in terms of European presence were the Spanish but before that the Payaya Indians were living there. Therefore when the question asks who were the first settlers in San Antonio it's referring to the original settlers upon European contact. Since they encountered Europeans after their arrival perhaps the Payaya Indians were the first settlers.  Alternatively maybe the answer is just the Spanish settlers because that's what I initially thought. But the context says Payaya Indians likely encountered the first Europeans so they might have been there before the Spanish.  I need to clarify: when the question asks for ""the first settlers "" are they referring to the European settlers or the original inhabitants? If it's about who first arrived from Europe then it would be the Spanish settlers. But if it's about who encountered Europeans first among the indigenous populations that would be the Payaya Indians.  But in the context provided it says San Antonio was a site before Spanish colonization and was its largest city for decades. So perhaps the original inhabitants were the Payaya Indians and then later the Spanish settlers came after them making the Payaya Indians the first settlers from an ethnic perspective when Europeans arrived.  Wait but the question is about who were the first settlers in San Antonio. The term ""settlement"" can be tricky here. If ""first settlers"" means the first people to establish a permanent settlement upon European arrival then it's likely the Spanish because they built settlements and infrastructure. However if ""first settlers"" refers to the original inhabitants before Europeans arrived then it would be the Payaya Indians.  But given that the context says San Antonio was a site for decades as its largest city before Spanish colonization perhaps the Payaya Indians were the original inhabitants who had been there for thousands of years and then after their arrival in 1519 or so (when Spanish settlers began arriving) they became the first settlers. So maybe the answer is the Spanish settlers because that's when San Antonio started as a settlement.  Alternatively since the Payaya Indians were there longer perhaps they are considered the original inhabitants and not settlers from Spain. But I think in historical contexts ""settlement"" refers to European actions so the first settlers would be the Spanish.

Context: Since medication to prevent rejection is so effective , donors do not need to be similar to their recipient . Most donated kidneys come from deceased donors ; however , the utilisation of living donors in the United States is on the rise . In 2006 , 47 % of donated kidneys were from living donors . This varies by country : for example , only 3 % of kidneys transplanted during 2006 in Spain came from living donors . In Spain all citizens are potential organ donors in the case of their death , unless they explicitly opt out during their lifetime .
Question: where do kidneys for kidney transplant come from
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where kidneys come from for a kidney transplant based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The first sentence says that since medication to prevent rejection is effective donors don't need to be similar to their recipients. That makes sense because if you take immunosuppressive drugs before the operation your body won't react as much to the donor's kidneys so they can come from people who aren't genetically identical.  Next it mentions that most donated kidneys come from deceased donors. So that's one major source. Then it talks about living donors stating that in 2006 only 47% of transplanted kidneys were from living donors. But I also see that this varies by country; for example Spain had only 3% which is lower than the average mentioned.  The context also notes that in Spain all citizens are potential organ donors at death unless they opt out during their lifetime. That's interesting but not directly answering the question about where kidneys come from generally.  Putting it all together the main points are: 1. Deceased donors are the primary source. 2. Living donors are increasing but still a smaller percentage (47% in 2006). 3. The context varies by country regarding living donors.  So when answering where kidneys come from the main sources are deceased and some living donors with deceased being more common. The context also explains that this ratio has been rising for living donors.  Kidneys for kidney transplants primarily come from deceased donors though there is an increasing contribution from living donors in certain regions like the U.S. where about 47% of transplanted kidneys came from living donors as of 2006.,kidneys for kidney transplants primarily come from deceased donors though there is increasing contribution from living donors in certain regions like us where about 47 of transplanted kidneys came from living donors as of 2006,deceased-donor (formerly known as cadaveric),0,0.049999999999999996,2.897424399998272,0.0010141594477147766,0.0002977780955599618,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: where does sex and the city take place
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out where ""Sex and the City"" takes place based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.

Question: who is the guy that jumped from space
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who the person is that jumped from space based on the given context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context starts by introducing Felix Baumgartner as an Austrian skydiver and BASE jumper known for his record-breaking jumps. It mentions he set several world records including breaking the sound barrier without any vehicle power during his descent in 2012.   Then it talks about Alan Eustace jumping from even higher altitude (135 890 feet or 41.42 km) with a drogue. Wait but Felix Baumgartner already jumped from space before that.

Wait actually looking at the context again: It says Felix Baumgartner is best known for jumping in 2012 from a helium balloon in the stratosphere. Then it mentions Alan Eustace jumping later from even higher altitude with a drogue. So the initial jump by Baumgartner was from space.

Question: when does mexico play in the winter olympics
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when Mexico plays in the Winter Olympics based on the provided context. Let me break this down step by step.  First looking at the context given: ""Robert Franco Men 's slopestyle 21.60 36.00 36.00 27 Did not advance."" I notice that there's a mention of Robert Franco and his performance in an event called ""slopestyle"" with some scores—21.60 36.00 another 36.00 and then 27. At the end it says he didn't advance.  Now I know that in sports events especially winter sports like skiing or snowboarding slopestyle is a competition format where athletes perform various tricks on a halfpipe course. The scores are probably from different aspects of their performance—like landing difficulty and style points.   But how does this relate to when Mexico plays in the Winter Olympics? Well Robert Franco Men is likely an athlete competing there. So if he's participating in slopestyle that would be part of a sport event. However the question is asking about when Mexico plays not what events they participate in.  Wait maybe I'm confusing ""plays"" with ""participates."" Mexico would send teams to compete in various sports at the Winter Olympics. Each country typically participates in multiple events across different disciplines. So the context given might be showing one of their athletes' performances rather than when the entire team is competing.  Since the question is about when Mexico plays I should think about the schedule of the Winter Olympics. The games are held every four years during the winter season. For example the 2018 Winter Olympics were in PyeongChang South Korea from February 9 to 17. Mexico usually participates at these events so they would compete around that time.  But I don't have specific information about when Mexico's slopestyle athletes are competing based on this context alone. It seems the context is more about an athlete's performance than the country's participation timing.

Question: • when is a spearman correlation meant to be used instead of a pearson correlation
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when Spearman's correlation should be used instead of Pearson's. From what I remember both are measures of association between two variables but they have different assumptions and uses.  Pearson's correlation is based on the actual values of the variables and assesses linear relationships. It works best when the data is normally distributed and there's a linear relationship. If the data has outliers or isn't linear Pearson might not capture the true relationship accurately.  Spearman's correlation on the other hand uses ranks of the data points making it a non-parametric test. This means it doesn't assume any particular distribution of the data and is better at capturing monotonic relationships—whether they're linear or just consistently increasing/decreasing. So if the variables have an underlying ordinal scale or the relationship isn't strictly linear but still monotonic Spearman would be more appropriate.  Also if there are tied ranks in the data (like multiple observations with the same value) Pearson's correlation can be affected especially in small samples whereas Spearman handles ties better by averaging their ranks.   So putting it all together: use Spearman when you're dealing with non-linear relationships ordinal data or when there are outliers because Pearson might not handle them as well.  Spearman's correlation is used instead of Pearson's when the relationship between variables is monotonic (but not necessarily linear) the data does not meet the assumptions of normality required for Pearson's or there are outliers that could affect Pearson's results.,spearmans correlation is used instead of pearsons when relationship between variables is monotonic but not necessarily linear data does not meet assumptions of normality required for pearsons or there are outliers that could affect pearsons results,"Pearson's correlation assesses linear relationships, Spearman's correlation assesses monotonic relationships (whether linear or not)",0,0.28,2.5946309999999357,0.0009013614295273292,0.0002646582748902612,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what is the official slogan for the 2018 winter olympics
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out the official slogan for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Olympics. I remember that each Olympic Games has a specific motto or slogan that reflects its theme and spirit.  Looking at the context provided it mentions the XXIII Olympic Winter Games hosted in Pyeongchang South Korea with the motto ""Passion. Connected. Korean: 하나 된 열정"" which translates to ""Passion. United. Korean: One united passion."" But that's for 2018 right?  Wait no hold on. The context seems a bit mixed up because it also mentions the XXIII Games as the 2018 ones but earlier it talks about other Olympics like Pyeongchang being the venue for XXIII which was in 2018. Then there's XXIV Sochi 2014 and so on.  But focusing back on the question: what is the official slogan? I think the 2018 Winter Olympics had a slogan related to ""passion"" or something similar since that was part of their motto. Maybe it was something along those lines but more specific.   I recall that sometimes the slogans are based on the host city's culture. Pyeongchang has a rich history with Korean culture so maybe the slogan emphasized unity and connection to Korean heritage.  Putting it together the official slogan might have been ""Pyeongchang: One united passion"" or something similar tying in both the location and the theme of passion as per their motto.  The official slogan for the 2018 Winter Olympics was ""Pyeongchang: One united passion.""", official slogan for 2018 winter olympics was pyeongchang one united passion,Passion.

Context: The Book of Jin , a 7th - century chronicle of the Chinese Jin Dynasty , reports that when Emperor Hui ( 259 -- 307 ) was told that his people were starving because there was no rice , he said , `` Why do n't they eat ( ground ) meat ? '' ( 何不 食 肉糜 ) , as part of showing how incompetent he was .
Question: who coined the phrase let them eat cake
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who coined the phrase ""let them eat cake."" Hmm. From what I remember that's a pretty common expression in English often used sarcastically or critically towards someone who can't handle criticism. But where did it come from?  I think it might be related to Chinese culture since the user mentioned The Book of Jin and Emperor Hui. Emperor Hui is known for his leadership during a time when rice was scarce and he responded with ""何不食肉糜"" (he didn't eat meat sludge) which translates literally but was meant sarcastically because there was no real meat available.  Wait but that's in Chinese. The phrase the user is asking about is in English: ""let them eat cake."" That might be a play on words or an adaptation from a similar Chinese expression. Maybe it's used as a humorous way to say someone shouldn't complain when they can't handle criticism like if someone says ""We need more money "" and you respond with ""let them eat cake "" implying they should just accept it.  I'm trying to recall if there's any historical context where this exact phrase was coined. Maybe it's from a business or political speech? Or perhaps it's part of English slang that evolved from observing how people handle criticism or complaints rather than directly borrowing from Chinese culture.  Wait I think it might be an idiom created in the English-speaking world to mimic the sarcastic or dismissive tone of the Chinese phrase. So maybe it wasn't coined by a specific individual but developed over time as people adopted and adapted phrases across cultures.  The phrase ""let them eat cake"" is a common English expression that originates from observing how people handle criticism rather than being directly borrowed from Chinese culture. It was likely developed in the English-speaking world to imitate the sarcastic tone of similar phrases.

Context: All of these processing events result in an antigen - binding region that is highly variable , even when the same gene segments are recombined . V ( D ) J recombination allows for the generation of immunoglobulins and T cell receptors to antigens that neither the organism nor its ancestor ( s ) need to have previously encountered , allowing for an adaptive immune response to novel pathogens that develop or to those that frequently change ( e.g. , seasonal influenza ) . However , a major caveat to this process is that the DNA sequence must remain in - frame in order to maintain the correct amino acid sequence in the final protein product . If the resulting sequence is out - of - frame , the development of the cell will be arrested , and the cell will not survive to maturity . V ( D ) J recombination is therefore a very costly process that must be ( and is ) strictly regulated and controlled .
Question: which gene segments code for the variable region of the heavy chain
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out which gene segments code for the variable region of the heavy chain based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions V(D)J recombination and how it's involved in generating immunoglobulins and T cell receptors. It says that this process allows for variability even when the same gene segments are recombined which is why the immune system can adapt to new or changing pathogens like seasonal influenza.  It also notes that V(D)J recombination involves DNA sequences that must stay in-frame to maintain the correct amino acid sequence; otherwise the cell doesn't survive. So the process isn't cheap and requires strict regulation.  Now focusing on the question: which gene segments code for the variable region of the heavy chain. From what I remember about V(D)J recombination the V D J genes are involved in this process. The V (variable) segment is where a lot of variability comes from because it's used to create diverse antigen-binding regions.  So putting that together the V gene segments must code for part of the variable region. Since D and J are also involved but perhaps not as directly variable as V maybe only V does. I think in heavy chains the V gene is crucial for the variable part.  The gene segments that code for the variable region of the heavy chain are the **V** genes., gene segments that code for variable region of heavy chain are v genes,V,0,0.14285714285714288,2.41746329999296,0.0008330827771151066,0.00024461025667327723,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who won the workd series of poker 2017
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who won the World Series of Poker in 2017. Let me start by recalling that the World Series of Poker (WSOP) is a major event in the poker world especially for cash games and tournaments. I know it's held in Las Vegas over several weeks each year.  Looking at the data provided there are entries listed with names like Chris ""Jesus"" Ferguson Phil GJordan Joe Hachem among others along with their winnings from various years up to 2017. Each entry includes a player's name an opponent or team their poker title(s) their hand history (which sometimes ends with ""The Shadow"") and their earnings.  I'm looking for the 2017 World Series of Poker champion. Scanning through the list I see several entries from 2015 onwards. In 2015 Joe Hachem won $8 029 995. In 2016 there's a player named Tommy Gun with winnings of $8 877 625 but it says N/A next to him which I'm not sure what that means exactly—maybe it's a placeholder or incomplete information.  Then in 2017 the entries start at Jonathan Duhamel. He has a hand history ending with ""The Shadow"" and his earnings are listed as $8 944 310. There's also another player named Jonathan Duhamel but that might be the same person. Another entry is for Ryan Riess who won $8 359 531 in 2013.  Wait maybe I should check if any other players from 2017 are listed. Let me go through each year carefully:  - **2015**: Joe Hachem - $8 029 995 - **2016**: Tommy Gun - N/A (winnings) but the amount is $8 877 625. - **2017**: Jonathan Duhamel - $8 944 310  But I also see another entry: ""Ryan Riess... 2013"" with winnings. So it seems that in 2017 the highest earner is Jonathan Duhamel with around $8.9 million.  Wait but I recall hearing that Chris ""Jesus"" Ferguson won the 2017 WSOP Main Event. Let me check if he's listed here. scrolling through... Yes! There's an entry for Chris Moneymaker in 2003 and another one from 2005: Hachem Joe - $8 029 995.  But looking at the data provided I don't see Chris Ferguson's name listed. The highest earner is Jonathan Duhamel with $8.9 million in 2017. So maybe he was the champion? Alternatively perhaps the information given doesn't list all the champions because it might only show top earners or not include some details.  Wait but I'm supposed to go by the data provided here. The user included a long table with poker tournament winners from various years up to 2017 and in 2017 the highest amount is Jonathan Duhamel's $8 944 310. So based on this data it seems that Jonathan Duhamel was the top earner for that year.  But I'm a bit confused because I thought Chris Ferguson won several times including in 2017. Maybe the table isn't comprehensive or perhaps the information given doesn't list all tournament champions from that period.  Alternatively maybe the champion is listed as someone else. Let me double-check the entries for 2017:  - ** Jonathan Duhamel** with winnings of $8 944 310 and another entry: ""Another Jonathan Duhamel"" with a slightly different amount ($8 944 138) which might be due to formatting or typos. But if both are the same person then he's the top earner.  But wait in poker tournaments sometimes there's only one champion. If Chris Ferguson wasn't listed here maybe this data doesn't capture all winners. So perhaps according to the table provided the 2017 WSOP champion is Jonathan Duhamel.  However I remember reading that Chris Ferguson won several times around that period including in 2017. Maybe there's an error or omission in the provided data. Alternatively perhaps the table only lists winners from certain tournaments and not the main event.  In any case based on the information given Jonathan Duhamel is listed as the top earner for 2017 with $8 944 310. So unless there's another entry I'm missing that might be the answer.  Based on the data provided the player who won the World Series of Poker in 2017 according to the highest earnings listed is Jonathan Duhamel with winnings of $8 944 310.",based on data provided player who won world series of poker in 2017 according to highest earnings listed is jonathan duhamel with winnings of 8944310,Scott Blumstein,0,0.0,9.761929799991776,0.0034713055750011704,0.001019246791576742,0.0,0.0,0.0
641,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: The motor tract .
Question: which body part(s) occupy the greatest portion of the primary motor cortex
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out which body parts make up the largest portion of the primary motor cortex based on the given context. Hmm let me start by recalling what I know about the motor cortex.  From what I remember the primary motor cortex is a part of the brain involved in controlling voluntary movements. It's located in the frontal lobe right? But wait it's not just one area; there are several regions within the motor cortex that handle different muscles and parts of the body.  I think about how each muscle group moves. For example the face has a lot of facial muscles so maybe the motor cortex covers most of these areas like the cheeks mouth nose and eyes. Then the arms have multiple muscles involved in movement—shoulders elbows wrists—all these would be under the control of different parts of the motor cortex.  The hands themselves must also be a significant area because they're so complex with many muscles. Similarly the legs involve hip knee and ankle muscles which are probably handled by other sections of the motor cortex. The trunk like the arms and torso might have its own share as well.  Putting this all together I can imagine that the primary motor cortex doesn't just cover one specific body part but a combination. It's likely that each major muscle group is represented in different areas of the motor cortex so collectively they make up the majority.  Wait did the context mention anything about it? Let me check again. The question provided mentions the motor tract and asks which body parts occupy the greatest portion. From my knowledge the primary motor cortex isn't just for one part but covers multiple muscles across different body areas. So faces arms legs trunk—are all involved.  I think that's right because each of these body parts has numerous muscle groups that require precise control during movement. Therefore the motor cortex must have extensive coverage over them to manage all these movements.  The primary motor cortex is primarily composed of regions that cover multiple body areas including faces ( Cheeks Mouth Nose Eyes ) arms legs and the trunk. These areas are crucial for controlling the complex movements involving these muscles.

642,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: Unlike passive transport , which uses the kinetic energy and natural entropy of molecules moving down a gradient , active transport uses cellular energy to move them against a gradient , polar repulsion , or other resistance . Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs , such as ions , glucose and amino acids . If the process uses chemical energy , such as from adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , it is termed primary active transport . Secondary active transport involves the use of an electrochemical gradient . Examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose in the intestines in humans and the uptake of mineral ions into root hair cells of plants .
Question: active transport performs which function in a cell
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what active transport does in a cell. Let me start by recalling what I know about active transport from my biology class. Active transport is different from passive transport because it uses energy right? Unlike passive transport which just lets molecules move without using energy and usually down a concentration gradient active transport requires energy.  The context provided mentions that active transport moves molecules against a gradient so that's the first thing I remember. It also says it's used to accumulate high concentrations of molecules like ions glucose and amino acids in the cell. Oh yeah cells need these things for various functions—like getting glucose into the bloodstream or amino acids into muscle cells during protein synthesis.  The context further explains that if ATP is involved it's primary active transport but I think secondary uses an electrochemical gradient instead. But the question is asking about the general function not the types based on energy sources.  So putting this together active transport must be moving substances against a concentration gradient using cellular energy to build up high concentrations inside the cell. That makes sense because if something moves down the gradient without energy it's passive but with energy cells can move molecules in the opposite direction where they're needed more.  Active transport is used by cells to move molecules against their concentration gradient and build up high concentrations of ions glucose amino acids or other substances inside the cell.,active transport is used by cells to move molecules against their concentration gradient and build up high concentrations of ions glucose amino acids or other substances inside cell,"usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs, such as ions, glucose and amino acids",0,0.43478260869565216,2.418701200003852,0.0008385372498140283,0.0002462118021661764,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who plays the dad in nanny mcphee and the big bang
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out who plays the dad in ""Nanny McPhee"" and also appears in ""The Big Bang Theory."" Let me start by recalling what each show is about.   ""Nanny McPhee"" is a movie where Nanny is the nanny to three kids the Greens: Norman Megsie and Vincent. The dads are their father Rory Green played by Ewan McGregor as per the context provided.  Now looking at ""The Big Bang Theory "" the main dad figure would be Dr. Charlie PREFIX known as Dr. PREFIX due to his mononym. However in the given list of actors from the original question's context I don't see anyone named PREFIX or similar. The closest might be Eros Vlahos as Cyril Sean Gray but that's a different family member.  Wait actually in ""Nanny McPhee "" Rory Green is the dad so he plays him. But for ""The Big Bang Theory "" it's Charlie PREFIX. Since the provided context doesn't list anyone else named PREFIX or close to it maybe there isn't an actor from that show listed here besides the ones related to ""Nanny McPhee"" and other roles.  So the answer would be Ewan McGregor for ""Nanny McPhee"" and since no one from ""The Big Bang Theory"" is listed except possibly someone like Ralph Fiennes if he's in both but looking back Ralph Fiennes plays Lord Gray. Wait that's a different character; Lord Gray isn't the father of the Green kids.  Wait maybe I'm mixing up roles. In ""Nanny McPhee "" Rory Green is the dad and he's played by Ewan McGregor. In ""The Big Bang Theory "" Dr. Charlie PREFIX is the main character's father figure but in the provided list there's no actor named PREFIX or similar. So perhaps none of the listed actors from the context are from ""The Big Bang Theory."" But since the user specified to use the context maybe Ewan McGregor is included as he plays a Green family member though not specifically the dad.  Wait but in ""Nanny McPhee "" the dads would be Rory (Ewan McGregor) and also there's Cyril and Celia's father Lord Gray played by Ralph Fiennes. But that's for a different story ""Big Bang Theory."" So perhaps Ewan McGregor is the dad in ""Nanny McPhee "" but no one from ""Big Bang Theory"" is listed here.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user asked for who plays the dad in ""Nanny McPhee"" and also appears in ""The Big Bang."" Since ""Big Bang"" doesn't have an actor listed here except perhaps someone else. Alternatively perhaps the father of Nanny's children is played by someone from another show.  Wait looking back at the context: Rory Green is Ewan McGregor but that's part of ""Nanny McPhee."" For ""The Big Bang Theory "" I don't see any actors listed who would play Dr. PREFIX. So maybe the answer is just Ewan McGregor for ""Nanny McPinee"" and no one from ""Big Bang"" in this context.  Wait perhaps the user meant someone else? But based on the given list Ewan McGregor plays Rory Green in ""Nanny McPhee "" but he's not part of ""The Big Bang Theory."" Maybe the answer is just Ewan McGregor for the dad part and no one from ""Big Bang"" because none are listed.  Alternatively perhaps I'm missing someone. Let me check again: The actors listed include Ewan McGregor as Rory Green in ""Nanny McPhee "" and Ralph Fiennes as Lord Gray who's a different character. So maybe there isn't an actor common to both shows in the provided context besides possibly Ralph Fiennes if he were also playing a role in ""Big Bang "" but that doesn't seem likely.  Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The user just wants two separate actors: one for ""Nanny McPhee"" and another for ""The Big Bang Theory."" Since Ewan McGregor is listed as Rory Green who's the dad so he plays that role in ""Nanny McPinee."" For ""Big Bang "" no one from the provided context is playing that character. So maybe I should only mention Ewan McGregor for the first part and state that there isn't an actor from ""The Big Bang"" listed here.  But perhaps the user made a mistake thinking of another role or character. Alternatively maybe someone like Ralph Fiennes plays a role in both shows? But no he's Lord Gray in ""Nanny McPinee "" which is different from ""Big Bang.""  Alternatively maybe I should look at all actors and see if anyone else appears in both. The only overlap might be Ewan McGregor as Rory Green but that's just part of his role in ""Nanny McPhee"" without being specifically the father in ""Big Bang."" So perhaps the answer is only Ewan McGregor for the first part and no one from the second.  Ewan McGregor plays the dad in ""Nanny McPhee "" while there isn't an actor listed here who appears in both ""Nanny McPinee"" and ""The Big Bang Theory.""",ewan mcgregor plays dad in nanny mcphee while there isnt actor listed here who appears in both nanny mcpinee and big bang theory,Ewan McGregor,0,0.16,8.75844920000236,0.0030945380156192728,0.0009086200784358024,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: The block names ( s , p , d , f and g ) are derived from the spectroscopic notation for the associated atomic orbitals : sharp , principal , diffuse and fundamental , and then g which follows f in the alphabet .
Question: where did the s-block p-block d-block and f-block of the periodic table get their names
Answer: ","Okay so I have this question about why the blocks in the periodic table are called s p d and f. I remember learning that these letters relate to something about atomic orbitals. Let me think.  I recall that each block corresponds to different types of orbitals. The s-block starts with elements like hydrogen and helium. These have electrons in s orbitals right? Then the p-block is after that which are the main body of elements. I think p comes from ""principal "" maybe?  Wait the question mentions something about spectroscopic notation. Oh yeah! Each block was named based on the type of spectral lines they produce when electrons fall back into lower energy levels. The s-orbitals produced lines called sharp so that's where 's' comes from.  For p principal makes sense because those are the more prominent or commonly observed lines in the spectrum. D probably follows from diffuse orbitals. I've heard that 'diffuse' was another term for d-electrons when they were first discovered.  Then there's f. Hmm after f came g? Because in the alphabet g comes right after f so maybe that's why it was called f-block before considering other possibilities. But wait no in the periodic table we only have s p d and f blocks because those were known at the time.  So putting it all together: each block corresponds to a type of orbital (s p d f) named after their spectral line characteristics or the order they came up. The names are sharp principal diffuse and then f follows naturally as 'g' would but wasn't used.  The s-block is named after ""sharp"" orbitals which produce sharp spectral lines. The p-block corresponds to ""principal"" orbitals with more prominent spectral lines. The d-block originates from ""diffuse"" orbitals and the f-block comes from the letter 'f' following 'd'.

After resting starters for the final two games , the 13 -- 3 Eagles soared past the Minnesota Vikings and the Atlanta Falcons in the playoffs , earning a trip to Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville against the defending champion New England Patriots . The game was hard fought , but the Eagles fell 24 -- 21 , ending their magical season one score short of the ultimate goal . This season was considered the franchise 's most successful until their Super Bowl LII - winning 2017 season .
Question: when did the eagles last play in a superbowl
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the Eagles last played in a Super Bowl based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The first part talks about the Eagles having a great season and steamrolling opponents with their offense featuring McNabb Owens and Westbrook as well as a strong defense led by Trotter Dawkins Sheppard and Lewis. They had a 13-1 start and went on to win 13-3 before resting starters for the final two games. Then they played against the Minnesota Vikings and Atlanta Falcons in the playoffs winning those games to advance to Super Bowl XXXIX.  After that it mentions they lost the Super Bowl to the Patriots but had a successful season until their Super Bowl LII victory in 2017. So the last Super Bowl they played in was Super Bowl LII which is Super Bowl 52 right? Wait no because they just won that one so maybe I need to check.  Wait let me re-read: ""This season was considered the franchise's most successful until their Super Bowl LII - winning 2017 season."" So before this current season (which is 2017) they won Super Bowl LII. The context ends with that so the last time they played in a Super Bowl would be Super Bowl LII which was in 2017.  But wait the initial part mentions them playing in Super Bowl XXXIX against the Patriots and losing. So their last play would have been either in 2015 (Super Bowl LII) or 2017? Let me make sure. The context says they had a successful season until that 2017 Super Bowl so before that season ended with Super Bowl LII victory the previous was Super Bowl XXXIX.  So their last game in the Super Bowl would be Super Bowl LII in 2017.

Question: patents to produce and sell inventions are conveyed by the federal government for a period​ of
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out how long patents for producing and selling inventions last in the U.S. system. I remember that patents are granted for a certain number of years but I'm not exactly sure if it's 10 or 20 years. Let me think back to when I studied this before.  I recall that for software which is more than just a physical product the patent term was longer in some cases especially for algorithms covered by the statute on software patents. But wait I also remember that most tangible inventions get a 17-year term now. Tangible means something you can touch or see like a machine or a process.  So if someone is producing and selling an invention which would typically be a physical product or a non-software process the default term is probably 17 years. The user mentioned the context about the LOT Network dealing with patent assertion entities by cross-licensing but that's probably not directly related to the duration of patents.  Wait I should make sure I'm not confusing software patents. In the U.S. software patents are generally not granted unless they meet specific criteria like being novel non-obvious and industrial application. But even so for those covered by the statute which is most software they have a 25-year term starting from the filing date not the filing of the patent office. So if someone files in 2014 their software patent would last until 2039.  But since the question isn't about software specifically and just asks about producing and selling inventions generally I think it's safe to say the default term is 17 years unless it's a software invention that meets the criteria. However in most cases especially for physical products it's 17 years.

Question: who was the grandfather on the cosby show
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who the grandfather is in The Cosby Show. I remember that The Cosby Show is a sitcom from the 1980s and it's based on a family drama with some humor. The main character is Charlie Cosby played by Ernie Cooperation.  From what I recall the Cosby family includes several siblings: Charlie his sister Mary and their parents. The grandfather mentioned in the show must be a significant figure. Given that the user already mentioned Earle Hyman as someone related to this context maybe he's involved here.  Wait the question specifically asks for the grandfather on The Cosby Show. I know that in the show Charlie has an older brother named Joe who is a radio announcer and also married to Maryann Joseph. Then Joe is married to Maryann so their children are also part of the family.  But looking back at the context provided earlier about Earle Hyman it's mentioned that he appeared on The Cosby Show as Cliff's father Russell Huxtable. So perhaps there's another grandfather figure besides Joe and Charlie.  Wait maybe I'm mixing up different shows or parts of the story. In The Cosby Show the main grandfather is actually a character played by Earle Hyman. He's the grandfather of both Charlie and Mary. He was married to Maryann Joseph as well. So he's an important family member in that series.  I think I got confused because there are multiple generations in the show but the main grandfather would be played by Earle Hyman. That makes sense since he provided a voice acting part related to The Cosby Show.

Context: The Boston Tea Party was a political protest and mercantile protest by the Sons of Liberty in Boston , Massachusetts , on December 16 , 1773 . In defiance of the Tea Act of May 10 , 1773 , which allowed the British East India company to sell tea from China in American colonies without paying any taxes , thus undercutting local tea merchants , the demonstrators , some disguised as Native Americans , destroyed an entire shipment of tea sent by the East India Company .
Question: where did the tea come from in the boston tea party
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the tea in the Boston Tea Party came from. From what I remember the Boston Tea Party was a significant event in American history involving a protest against British taxes. The Sons of Liberty who were situated in Boston Massachusetts protested by destroying a shipment of tea.  The question is asking specifically about the origin of that tea. I think it's linked to the Tea Act of 1773. From what I recall this act allowed British East India companies to sell tea from China in American colonies without having to pay taxes. This was done to prevent local merchants from making a profit when selling the cheaper Chinese tea.  So if the Tea Act was in place and it exempted the import of tea from being taxed that would mean the tea was coming from China because it wasn't subject to British taxes. The Boston Tea Party participants some dressed as Native Americans destroyed a large shipment of tea sent by the East India Company. Since the act was about not taxing Chinese tea this action was likely in response to that policy.  Putting it all together the tea came from China because the Tea Act exempted imports from Britain from taxes at the time.  The tea for the Boston Tea Party came from China due to the Tea Act of 1773 which exempted imported goods like Chinese tea from taxation., tea for boston tea party came from china due to tea act of 1773 which exempted imported goods like chinese tea from taxation,British East India company to sell tea from China,0,0.25,2.3155110999941826,0.0007977288335961103,0.00023422961091255066,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who was one of the first to chart the course of forgetting over time
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who was one of the first to chart the course of forgetting over time. The context provided mentions Hermann Ebbinghaus and something about an exponential curve.   Hmm let me read that again carefully. It says in 1885 Hermann Ebbinghaus collected data to plot a forgetting curve. Then it also mentions that today we approximate forgetting with an exponential curve.  So putting this together Hermann Ebbinghaus was the one who did the work back in 1885. He plotted the forgetting curve which is related to how information is forgotten over time. The context also connects his work to using an exponential curve now but I think that's just a modern approximation of his findings.  I don't see any other names mentioned here so it seems like Hermann Ebbinghaus is the person in question.

At the conclusion of the film , Walter deduces that he is a Muppet , adopts whistling as his sole talent and joins the group as their newest member .
Question: who did the whistling in the muppet movie
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out who did the whistling in the Muppet Movie. From what I remember Walter is one of the main characters played by Jim Parsons. The question mentions something about whistling at the end and I think it's related to a song or performance he does.   I recall that in the movie there are scenes where Walter struggles with whether he's a real person or a Muppet. There's also this song called ""Man or Muppet"" which is pretty important for his character development. Now the whistling part—I think that was highlighted during an important scene where he resolves his internal conflict.  So the question specifically asks who did the whistling at the end of the movie. I believe Andrew Bird was involved because he's a musician and contributed some parts of the soundtrack. Since Andrew Bird is known for providing music in Muppets it makes sense that he would handle such a significant performance as part of Walter's transformation.  Wait but I should double-check if it's actually him. Maybe I'm mixing up other scenes or songs. The movie has several iconic duets with Jim Parsons and additional actors like Rowan Atkinson and Amy Poetlevé. But the whistling at the end is probably by Andrew Bird because he's the musician in charge of the movie's soundtrack.  Yes that sounds right. So putting it all together the person who whistled was Andrew Bird.

Question: how many games in a row have the uconn women's basketball team won
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out how many games in a row the UConn women's basketball team has won based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that UConn owns the two longest winning streaks in college basketball history any gender. It talks about both the men's and women's teams? Wait no actually it says ""any gender "" but I'm focusing on the women's team here because that's the question.  Wait hold on. The first part says UConn has the two longest winning streaks overall in college basketball history. So is this referring to both men's and women's? But then it goes into specific details about their men's teams. Let me check again.  The context starts by talking about the men's team having an 111-game streak starting in November 2014 and ending with a loss in March 2017. Then it mentions the second streak of 90 games including two undefeated seasons (2008-09 and 09-10). So for men's basketball UConn has these long streaks.  But then I'm supposed to find information about their women's basketball team. The question is asking specifically about the women's team's consecutive wins. However in the provided context there's no mention of the women's team's winning streak. It only talks about the men's team.  So without any information about UConn's women's basketball team's streaks or wins I can't determine how many games they've won consecutively.

Context: The Berlin Wall ( German : Berliner Mauer , pronounced ( bɛʁˈliːnɐ ˈmaʊ̯ɐ ) ( listen ) ) was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989 . Constructed by the German Democratic Republic ( GDR , East Germany ) , starting on 13 August 1961 , the Wall cut off ( by land ) West Berlin from virtually all of surrounding East Germany and East Berlin until government officials opened it in November 1989 . Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and finished in 1992 . The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls , accompanied by a wide area ( later known as the `` death strip '' ) that contained anti-vehicle trenches , `` fakir beds '' and other defenses . The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the `` will of the people '' in building a socialist state in East Germany . In practice , the Wall served to prevent the massive emigration and defection that had marked East Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period .
Question: when did the wall come down in berlin
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the Berlin Wall fell. From what I remember it was a huge barrier built between West Berlin and East Berlin. The context provided says that the Berlin Wall was constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR) starting on August 13 1961. It remained up until November 11 1989 when government officials opened it. Then demolition started on June 13 1990 and finished in 1992.  The question is asking specifically when the wall came down which I think refers to when it was demolished. So based on the context the demolition began in 1990 and finished in 1992. Therefore the wall fell by the end of 1992.  The Berlin Wall fell by the end of 1992 as it was demolished over two years after construction stopped in November 1989.

Context: Creatine is not an essential nutrient as it is naturally produced in the human body from the amino acids glycine and arginine . In the first step of the biosynthesis these two amino acids are combined by the enzyme arginine : glycine amidinotransferase ( AGAT , EC : 2.1. 4.1 ) to form guanidinoacetate , which is then methylated by guanidinoacetate N - methyltransferase ( GAMT , EC : 2.1. 1.2 ) , using S - adenosyl methionine as the methyl donor . Creatine itself can be phosphorylated by creatine kinase to form phosphocreatine , which is used as an energy buffer in skeletal muscles and the brain .
Question: where does creatine come from in the body
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where creatine comes from in the body based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that creatine is not an essential nutrient because it's naturally produced by the human body. It mentions that it's synthesized from two amino acids: glycine and arginine. The first step involves an enzyme called arginine-glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) which combines these two amino acids to form guanidinoacetate.  Then this intermediate compound undergoes methylation by another enzyme guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT). This step uses S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor. After that creatine can be phosphorylated by an enzyme called creatine kinase to form phosphocreatine.  So putting it all together creatine is produced from glycine and arginine through these enzymatic steps. There's no mention of dietary sources for creatine since it's endogenous meaning the body produces it. Therefore the answer should reflect that it's synthesized within the body using those two amino acids with the help of specified enzymes.  Creatine is synthesized in the body from glycine and arginine through a two-step enzymatic process involving arginine-glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) to form guanidinoacetate followed by methylation by guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT) using S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor.,creatine is synthesized in body from glycine and arginine through twostep enzymatic process involving arginineglycine amidinotransferase agat to form guanidinoacetate followed by methylation by guanidinoacetate nmethyltransferase gamt using sadenosylmethionine as methyl donor,"in skeletal muscle, while the remainder is distributed in the blood, brain, and other tissues",0,0.13333333333333333,2.710359900011099,0.0009417279510586517,0.0002765107167652177,0.0,0.0,0.0

Rust consists of hydrated iron ( III ) oxides Fe O nH O and iron ( III ) oxide - hydroxide ( FeO ( OH ) , Fe ( OH ) ) .
Question: what happens when iron reacts with oxygen and water
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what happens when iron reacts with oxygen and water. From the context given about rust I know that rust is an iron oxide formed by a redox reaction between iron and oxygen in the presence of moisture.  So breaking it down iron (Fe) reacts with oxygen (O₂) and water (H₂O). The result is rust which is an oxide. The main form mentioned is Fe₂O₃·nH₂O so that's iron(III) oxide combined with water molecules bound to it.  Wait but in the context it says forms are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy under different conditions. But for this question I just need the reaction itself when iron reacts with O2 and H2O.  So putting it together: Iron is oxidized (loses electrons) from Fe metal to Fe³⁺ ions as it combines with oxygen and water to form rust.  When iron reacts with oxygen and water it undergoes a redox process forming hydrated iron(III) oxides known as rust. The reaction produces iron oxide-hydroxide complexes like Fe₂O₃·nH₂O.

This is because it is seen as unfair to other investors who do not have access to the information , as the investor with insider information could potentially make larger profits than a typical investor could make .
Question: why is most insider trading against the law
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out why most insider trading is against the law. The context provided explains that insider trading involves individuals trading stocks or other securities based on non-public information they have. It also mentions that this kind of trading is illegal in many countries because it's considered unfair to others who don't have such info and could make bigger profits.  Hmm so the main points are about unfairness and potential for larger profits. But why does this make it illegal? Maybe because laws aim to protect investors equally. If someone has insider info they might manipulate the market to get huge gains while others just try to make a modest profit through normal investing.  Also there's something called the efficient market hypothesis which suggests that all public information is already reflected in stock prices so non-public info gives an edge. This could lead to manipulating prices and creating risks for others trading without that info.  So putting it together laws against insider trading are meant to prevent unfair advantages protect investor fairness uphold market integrity and follow ethical practices. These reasons ensure the market remains fair and transparent.  Insider trading is illegal because laws aim to prevent unfair advantages by individuals with non-public information ensuring equal treatment for all investors upholding market integrity and enforcing ethical standards.,insider trading is illegal because laws aim to prevent unfair advantages by individuals with nonpublic information ensuring equal treatment for all investors upholding market integrity and enforcing ethical standards,"because it is seen as unfair to other investors who do not have access to the information, as the investor with insider information could potentially make larger profits than a typical investor could make",0,0.26666666666666666,2.217735600002925,0.0007603755571550301,0.00022326191983930446,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when did the continental congress vote to adopt the declaration of independence
Answer: ",Alright so I need to figure out when the Continental Congress voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence. Let me go through the context provided step by step.  First the context mentions that the Second Continental Congress convened on May 10 1775 at Philadelphia's State House. It passed a resolution for independence the following year on July 2 1776. Then it publicly asserted the decision two days later with the Declaration of Independence on July 4 1776.  So looking at this timeline: May 10 1775 – convened; July 2 1776 – passed resolution for independence; July 4 1776 – declared independence publicly.  Wait a second the question is about when they voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence. The key here might be understanding that passing a resolution and adopting the Declaration are two different actions. The resolution was passed in July 1776 but the actual adoption happened later with the Declaration on July 4 1776.  So the vote or resolution was adopted as part of their discussions leading up to declaring independence publicly. But since the context doesn't specify a separate meeting where they voted to adopt the Declaration itself beyond declaring it publicly perhaps the answer is that they adopted it publicly on July 4 1776.

Question: last episode of what happens to my family
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the answer to ""What happens to My Family"" based on the provided context. The context includes a list of episodes with their broadcast dates and ratings from both TNmS (probably some kind of rating system) and Nielsen ratings across different areas like Nationwide Capital Area.  Looking at the data each episode has three or four percentages under TNmS and three under Nielsen but only some have all four. The last episode listed is on February 15 2015 titled ""What happens to my family?"" with TNmS ratings of 40.8% 43.5% 43.1% and 42.4%. The Nielsen ratings for the same episode are 41.9% in one area and perhaps others aren't provided here.  I'm assuming that the question is asking about what happens to My Family which I think is a TV show or series. Since it's based on context from episodes maybe this was part of an ongoing series where each episode had different ratings over time. The last episode listed has these high percentages so perhaps ""What happens to my family"" is the final episode in that series.  The user might be asking for details about what happened in that particular episode or if there's a continuation beyond it.

Question: what is the purpose of a jake brake
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out what the user's question is. They provided context about someone named Jacobs using ""Jake Brakes"" on signs that prohibit engine retarding brakes. The user is asking about the purpose of a Jake Brake.  So first I should think about what ""retarding brakes"" are in engines. Retarding brakes are used to slow down or stop the engine when it's not needed anymore like after starting something. They help prevent the engine from overheating and are often found in cars or machinery.  Now why would someone make a sign using ""Jake Brakes""? Maybe they're promoting their own product Jacobs Brakes which could be another brand of retarding brakes. By calling them ""Jake Brakes "" perhaps they want to attract attention because it's catchy or memorable. Alternatively they might think it's a clever marketing ploy to confuse customers or competitors.  I should also consider the context from the user about trademark issues and discrimination against Jacobs products. It seems like Jacobs is upset that someone else is using ""Jake Brakes"" instead of their own brand name which could lead them to file a complaint or take legal action against the sign.  Putting it all together I need to answer what Jake brakes are used for in simple terms without getting too deep into the trademark issue.

Question: who won the mens curling in the olympics 2018
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out who won men's curling at the 2018 Olympics based on the context provided. Let me look at the data given.  The context shows a table with columns labeled Edin Shuster and Final along with some numbers and X marks. The rows are labeled Sweden (Edin) United States (Shuster) and Final. The numbers under each row seem to represent scores or rankings across different years from 5 to 10.  Looking at the final row it's marked as ""Final"" with a score of 7 for Sweden and 10 for the United States. This suggests that the United States had a higher score in their final event. Since curling is about accumulating points over several ends (or rounds) the team with the most points would be the winner.  Given that the United States scored 10 points which is higher than Sweden's 7 it's logical to conclude they won. The other entries for Edin and Shuster across years from 5 to 9 probably refer to different tournaments or events but the final result here clearly shows the United States as the winner.

Question: the man in the high castle episode 1 season 1
Answer: ","Alright so I'm trying to figure out who ""the man in the high castle"" is. The user mentioned it's related to the first season of a TV show called ""The Man in the High Castle."" Let me think about what that series is about.  I remember hearing about this show before; it's set during World War II right? It's based on a book I've read but I don't recall the specifics. The title suggests there might be a prominent character who is a man of influence or importance. Maybe he's a leader or plays a crucial role in the story.  I should consider if ""the man"" refers to a specific person known from history during that time. Maybe someone like Hitler? But that seems too obvious and not likely given the context as I think the show portrays him more neutrally or as a tragic figure rather than focusing on his personal flaws.  Wait maybe it's another character entirely. Since it's set in a high medieval-like castle perhaps he has a unique role there. Maybe someone with military significance? Or perhaps a political leader within the story. I'm not sure but without more context it's hard to pinpoint exactly who he is.  I think the best approach is to look up information about ""The Man in the High Castle"" first to get an overview of the series and its main characters before focusing on the specific question.  ""The Man in the High Castle"" is a TV series based on a novel set during World War II. It features a prominent character who plays a crucial role in the narrative though the exact identity isn't explicitly revealed beyond his prominence. The series delves into complex themes without focusing solely on historical figures like Hitler suggesting a more nuanced portrayal of power and conflict.

Question: where does the extra chromosome 21 come from
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out where this extra chromosome 21 comes from. From what I remember in genetics each human has two sets of chromosomes—46 in total—one set inherited from each parent. Chromosomes are usually numbered based on size and they come in pairs except for the sex chromosomes.  The context given mentions something about chromosome 21 duplication. It talks about q 22.3 which I think is a region on chromosome 21. Then there's some numbers: 2858 3200 7007412000010000000 ♠ and another set with 41 200 001 and 7007467099830000000 ♠. I'm not exactly sure what those numbers represent here.  Wait the context also includes ""gneg."" I think that's a term related to genomic imprinting or maybe something about genes being expressed differently based on the parent of origin. But how does this relate to chromosome 21 duplication?  I recall that duplications in chromosomes can lead to extra genetic material. Sometimes these duplications come from non-disjunction during meiosis where two homologous chromosomes don't separate properly. Since each set should have one copy normally if an extra isn't there originally it must be added later.  So maybe chromosome 21 duplication is a result of such errors in cell division. The extra chromosome comes into being because during the formation of gametes (like eggs and sperm) the chromosomes didn't separate correctly leading to offspring with an extra copy.  I'm not entirely sure if there's a specific cause mentioned here like whether it's from paternal or maternal contributions more often. But generally any duplication would come from such improper segregation.  The extra chromosome 21 likely comes from an error in meiosis where homologous chromosomes fail to separate properly resulting in their duplication during gamete formation.

Context: Around September , with the sun fast retreating south , the northern land mass of the Indian subcontinent begins to cool off rapidly . With this air pressure begins to build over northern India , the Indian Ocean and its surrounding atmosphere still holds its heat .

Question: the cold dry winds that blow over northern india in winter are called
Answer: ","Alright so I'm trying to figure out what the cold dry winds that blow over northern India in winter are called. From the context given there's a mention of something called the Northeast Monsoon and the Retreating Monsoon around September when the sun is retreating south. It says that with the northern land mass of the Indian subcontinent cooling off air pressure builds up causing cold winds from the Himalayas and Indo-Gangetic Plain to sweep down towards the Indian Ocean.  Wait but the question is about the cold dry winds in winter. The context talks about monsoons happening around September which I think is actually a time when it's northeast monsoon season because monsoons can be seasonal. But the question mentions ""winter "" so maybe they're referring to the reverse of that?  In the context it describes the Northeast Monsoon as the cold wind coming from the Himalayas and Indo-Gangetic Plain towards the Indian Ocean south of the Deccan peninsula. That's during a certain period. So if monsoons are seasonal perhaps when it's winter elsewhere or in India there's another type of wind.  Wait maybe the cold dry winds during winter would be something else like the Easterly winds? Or perhaps the trade winds. But I don't think so because trade winds are more equatorial. Alternatively could it be the Southwest Monsoon when it's northeast is off?  Alternatively thinking again in the context after the monsoon season (northeast) there might be a northeast wind or something else. But wait maybe during winter the monsoon is over so perhaps the trade winds kick in but are they cold dry?  Wait no trade winds are generally warm and easterly. Maybe it's just that when the monsoon is blowing from northeast towards west those would be the cold winds. So if September has the Northeast Monsoon then maybe around March or something else could have the Southwest Monsoon? But I'm not sure.  Wait but in the context after the monsoon season perhaps there's an easterly wind that starts building up during winter. Because when the sun is retreating south by September leading to the monsoon then maybe when it's further south like in winter the pressure changes.  Alternatively perhaps the cold dry winds in winter are called the Easterly winds or something else. But I think more accurately the context describes the Northeast Monsoon as that specific wind pattern. So maybe during winter there's another monsoon season from the other direction? Or is it just referred to differently?  Wait no thinking again: The Northeast Monsoon happens when the northeast winds are blowing over India during a certain period. So perhaps in winter those same northeast winds might be part of that same monsoon system but with different pressure areas.  Alternatively maybe the question is referencing the reverse: when it's northeast wind bringing cold from the Himalayas and Indo-Gangetic Plain towards the Indian Ocean as the Northeast Monsoon. But during winter maybe there are other winds like the Southwest or Easterly. Wait but the context doesn't mention another monsoon in winter.  Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about cold dry winds in winter over northern India and from the context when it's Northeast Monsoon (September) those are cold winds. So perhaps during winter maybe the same system or a different one?  Wait but no typically monsoons have specific seasons. Northeast monsoon is around September to November and then there's another monsoon season called the Southwest monsoon in December to February. So if that's the case then during winter (December) it would be the Southwest Monsoon.  But wait the context didn't mention that. It only talked about Northeast Monsoon as being caused by cooling northern India with cold winds from the Himalayas and Indo-Gangetic Plain. So perhaps in winter when the northeast monsoon is over maybe the same cold winds are still present but in a different direction.  Alternatively I'm getting confused because the context didn't mention winter monsoons only that when it's northeast around September those winds blow. Maybe the answer is just ""Northeast Monsoon "" as per the question's time frame of winter which might be the same as Northeast Monsoon happening again in winter.  Wait no that doesn't make sense because monsoons have their own seasons. So maybe I'm supposed to look beyond the context for standard meteorological terms.  Alternatively perhaps it's called the Southwest Trade Winds or something like that during winter. But trade winds are more about easterly direction and warmer air.  But in the context given when the northeast wind is blowing over northern India from the Himalayas towards the Indian Ocean as the Northeast Monsoon (September). So if we're talking about winter perhaps it's the same but just called differently or maybe it's part of another monsoon.  Wait I'm getting stuck. Let me try to parse the context again: The sun retreating south around September causes northern India to cool leading to an air pressure build-up and cold winds from Himalayas and Indo-Gangetic Plain towards the Indian Ocean as Northeast Monsoon (Retreating Monsoon). So during this time it's called the Northeast Monsoon.  But what about in winter? If I'm looking for the cold dry winds over northern India during winter maybe they're part of another monsoon season or perhaps a different wind system. But according to the context given only the Northeast Monsoon is mentioned. So perhaps the answer intended is ""Northeast Monsoon "" assuming that despite being called differently in different seasons it's still referred to as such.  Wait but no each monsoon has its own name based on direction and timing. The Southwest Monsoon would be when those winds come from the opposite side. But since the context only describes the Northeast Monsoon around September maybe during winter it refers to another system perhaps called the West Coast monsoon or something else.  Alternatively maybe the answer is simply ""Easterly wind"" but that's too vague. Wait no. The context specifically mentions the cold winds as coming from the Himalayas and Indo-Gangetic Plain towards the Indian Ocean as Northeast Monsoon. So during winter if those same conditions hold (cooling northern India) it would still be called the Northeast Monsoon.  Alternatively perhaps in winter that wind is part of a different system or just another name for trade winds but I don't think so because trade winds are generally easterly and warm.  Wait maybe during winter there's no monsoon so the cold dry winds would be something else. But if we're talking about when it's blowing over northern India in winter perhaps it's still part of a monsoon system called Northeast Monsoon despite being in winter.  So putting this all together I think the answer is ""Northeast Monsoon"" because that's the term given in the context for those cold winds from September onwards. So even during winter if the conditions are met they might be referred to as the same monsoon system.

Question: the cast of don't tell mom the babysitter's dead
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who is in the cast of ""Don't Tell Mom the Baby's Dead."" Let me start by recalling what I know about this show. It's a spin-off of ""Bewitched "" right? The main character was Mrs. Sturak played by Dan Castellaneta. That part I'm pretty sure about.  Looking at the context provided earlier I see names like Christina Applegate as Sue Ellen `` Swell '' Crandell and Joanna Cassidy as Rose Lindsey. Wait those are from ""Bewitched "" not the spin-off. So maybe they're not part of ""Don't Tell Mom the Baby's Dead."" Hmm.  I remember that ""Don't Tell Mom"" had some original stars. Let me think about them one by one. The first lead was Michael Landon as Bruce right? He was the son of Bruce from ""Bewitched."" So I should include him in the cast list.  Then there's Mary Steenburgen as Mrs. Sturak. She played the elderly neighbor who moved into the house after the original family left. That makes sense because she's a key character in both shows probably carried over to the spin-off.  Jeffrey Hunter was originally plays Dr. Harold Swills in ""Bewitched "" so he must be part of this show too. He had a cameo role as the doctor who treats Sue Ellen I think.  Another name that comes up is Michael copeland as Walter Crandell. Wait is that from ""Don't Tell Mom"" or another show? I'm not entirely sure but since it's in the context provided maybe he is part of this cast. Also there are other actors like Bryan and Carolyn Crandell who might be the parents of the main character.  Wait the context also mentions some voice actors like Dan Castellaneta himself as Animated Mrs. Sturak. That's an extra role but since it's in the context maybe he was part of this show too.

668,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: Sympathetic nervous system stimulation causes vasoconstriction of most blood vessels , including many of those in the skin , the digestive tract , and the kidneys . This occurs as a result of activation of alpha - 1 adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine released by post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons . These receptors exist throughout the vasculature of the body but are inhibited and counterbalanced by beta - 2 adrenergic receptors ( stimulated by epinephrine release from the adrenal glands ) in the skeletal muscles , the heart , the lungs , and the brain during a sympathoadrenal response . The net effect of this is a shunting of blood away from the organs not necessary to the immediate survival of the organism and an increase in blood flow to those organs involved in intense physical activity .
Question: what does the adrenal gland produce that is necessary for the sympathetic nervous system to function
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out what the adrenal gland produces that's needed for the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) to work. From the context provided I remember that the SNS involves neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and epinephrine. The question is about what the adrenal glands produce specifically.  Looking at the context again it mentions that beta-2 adrenergic receptors are stimulated by epinephrine which comes from the adrenal glands. So when the sympathetic response occurs the adrenal glands release epinephrine to activate these receptors in certain parts of the body. That makes sense because the SNS needs an neurotransmitter to signal and affect various organs.  Wait but does the question ask about what's produced or something else? It says ""what does the adrenal gland produce that is necessary for the SNS to function."" So it's specifically asking about the product from the adrenal glands essential for SNS.  Norepinephrine is also a neurotransmitter involved in the SNS but I don't think it comes directly from the adrenal glands. Instead norepinephrine is released by post-ganglionic neurons that are part of the sympathetic chain. So maybe the answer isn't norepinephrine because the question focuses on what the adrenal gland produces.  Thus epinephrine must be the neurotransmitter produced by the adrenal glands (or more precisely the parasympathetic branch of the adrenals) that's necessary for SNS function. This is because beta-2 receptors in muscles and other structures are activated by epinephrine during a sympathoadrenal response.  The adrenal gland produces epinephrine which stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors in response to the sympathoadrenal response aiding the functioning of the sympathetic nervous system.

With no chance of saving any of the provisions stored in the enclosure , Prendick realizes that during the night Montgomery has also destroyed the only boats on the island .
Question: how does montgomery died in the island of dr moreau
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out how Montgomery died on the island of Dr. Moreau based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions several events:  1. Prendick becomes used to the Beast Folk's behavior over time. 2. A puma woman escapes from the lab and Dr. Moreau pursues her resulting in a mutual kill with Montgomery. 3. After that incident Prendick decides to leave but later hears a commotion outside where Montgomery his servant M'ling and the Sayer of the Law die during a scuffle with the Beast Folk. 4. Additionally the compound burns down because Prendick knocked over a lamp leaving no chance to save any provisions or boats.  So from this I can see that there are two main causes of Montgomery's death:  First he was involved in an attack by the puma woman led by the Beast Folk when she escaped. Dr. Moreau had to fight her and ended up killing both her and Montgomery. That seems like a direct cause.  Second after Prendick decides to leave he hears a commotion outside where Montgomery along with M'ling and the Sayer of the Law die during a scuffle with the Beast Folk. This suggests that another conflict occurred involving them while Prendick was leaving.  I should make sure which event specifically caused his death. The context states both an incident with the puma woman and another with the Beast Folk when Prendick leaves so it seems like there were at least two separate events where Montgomery died.  But wait reading again: After the escape of the puma woman Dr. Moreau kills both her and Montgomery. Then later Prendick hears a commotion outside where Montgomery (and others) die during a scuffle with the Beast Folk as he leaves. So perhaps there were two separate incidents? Or maybe they're part of the same event?  Wait but in the context after the puma woman's escape and Dr. Moreau killing them both Prendick decides to leave and later hears about another commotion where Montgomery dies again with others when the Beast Folk attack.  So perhaps he died twice once during the initial attack by the puma woman and then again when he was leaving as part of a scuffle outside.  But I need to clarify. The question is how Montgomery died on the island of Dr. Moreau. So it's likely that he died in two separate instances: first during the fight with the puma woman which led to his death along with others and then again later when Prendick was leaving as part of another conflict.  But I should check if these are separate events or if one caused the other. The context says after the initial incident Dr. Moreau kills her and Montgomery. Then later while Prendick is leaving he hears about a scuffle where others die. So it seems like there were two separate deaths for Montgomery: once during the puma woman's escape and another time when he left.  But that might not make sense because typically someone wouldn't die twice unless it was an accident or something else. Maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read again:  ""Montgomery breaks down and decides to share his alcohol with the Beast Folk. Prendick resolves to leave the island  but later hears a commotion outside in which Montgomery  his servant M'ling  and the Sayer of the Law die after a scuffle with the Beast Folk . At the same time  the compound burns down because Prendick has knocked over a lamp . With no chance of saving any of the provisions stored in the enclosure  Prendick realizes that during the night Montgomery has also destroyed the only boats on the island .  So the first death is from being killed by the puma woman. Then after leaving during his escape another conflict occurs where he and others die.  Wait but the context says ""after a scuffle with the Beast Folk"" when Prendick hears the commotion outside. So it's possible that both events happened: one in which Dr. Moreau kills her and Montgomery and another in which Montgomery dies again during his own leaving perhaps while trying to escape or running into them.  Alternatively maybe after leaving he returns only to find them dead because of a fight with the Beast Folk.  This is getting a bit confusing. I think the key points are:  1. Dr. Moreau kills the puma woman and Montgomery when she escapes. 2. Later as Prendick leaves he hears about another incident where he M'ling and the Sayer of the Law die during a scuffle with the Beast Folk.  So perhaps these are two separate incidents leading to his death: one while trying to escape after the initial attack and another when he's fleeing again later on.  But I'm not entirely sure. The context might suggest that both events happened so he died twice? That seems unlikely unless it's an accident or something else. Maybe he was killed by each encounter separately.  In any case for the answer I need to state how Montgomery died based on the provided context.  So from the text:  - He was killed by Dr. Moreau when she and the puma woman escaped. - Later during Prendick's leaving he was involved in another scuffle with the Beast Folk that led to his death.  But perhaps it's better to state that he died twice: once with Dr. Moreau during their fight and the puma woman's escape and again later when Prendick was fleeing as part of a scuffle with the Beast Folk.  Wait but the context says ""after a scuffle"" which is after he hears about it while leaving. So maybe both deaths happened in different parts: first the initial incident where he dies along with others then another incident on his way back causing him to die again.  But that might not make sense because if he's dead from the first incident how would he go through another incident? Perhaps the second incident is after he tries to leave and encounters them again.  I think I need to structure it clearly.  Montgomery died twice in the island of Dr. Moreau. First he was killed during a confrontation with the puma woman led by the Beast Folk when she escaped from the lab; Dr. Moreau and he engaged in mutual combat leading to their deaths. Later while Prendick was leaving the island another scuffle occurred between Montgomery his servant M'ling and the Sayer of the Law resulting in their deaths as well.",montgomery died twice in island of dr moreau first he was killed during confrontation with puma woman led by beast folk when she escaped from lab dr moreau and he engaged in mutual combat leading to their deaths later while prendick was leaving island another scuffle occurred between montgomery his servant mling and sayer of law resulting in their deaths as well,"Montgomery, his servant M'ling, and the Sayer of the Law die after a scuffle with the Beast Folk",0,0.3157894736842105,10.595212000000174,0.0037564115106653983,0.0011029597646661684,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who has the most big ten championships in football
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out which team has the most Big Ten Championships in football based on the provided context. Let me start by looking through the data given.  First I see that the Michigan team has a list of years from 1898 up to various years like 2017. Counting each entry might be tedious but I notice they have 42 championships listed. That's already more than some other teams.  Then there's Ohio State with 36 championships. So that's less than Michigan but still a lot.  Looking at the rest of the universities: - Minnesota has 18 championships. - Illinois has 15. - Wisconsin has 14. - Iowa has 11. - Michigan State has 9. - Northwestern and Purdue each have 8. - Chicago has 7. - Penn State Indiana Nebraska Maryland and Rutgers all have fewer or zero championships.  Wait a minute the user asked for football championships. I should make sure that these are indeed football championships because some schools might have more in other sports like basketball. But since the question is about football maybe it's just a matter of counting based on the given data.  Michigan has 42 Ohio State 36 and the rest are significantly lower.

Question: where was gunsmoke to the last man filmed
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where ""Guns n' Roses"" was filmed in the movie ""Gunsmoke to the Last Man."" The user provided a context that says the location is Tucson Arizona. But wait I remember hearing something about this movie before. Wasn't part of it actually made in Las Cruces? Or maybe it's a mix?  Let me think... ""Guns n' Roses"" was inspired by a novel called ""Gunsmoke to the Last Man."" The novel is set in Tucson Arizona which makes sense because it's in the Sonoran Desert and has a lot of history with Manifest Destiny. So Tucson might be accurate for where most of the scenes were filmed.  But I'm not 100% sure if all parts are from Tucson or if some scenes took place elsewhere. Sometimes films take locations that match the setting so maybe the desert background was filmed in Tucson. Las Cruces is a bit further north and has different vibes but perhaps it's where some specific scenes happened.  Wait no I think more of the movie was filmed there because Tucson has the appropriate climate and environment for the story. The desert landscape is crucial to the film's atmosphere.

Question: love me i'm a liberal song meaning
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the meaning of the song ""Love Me I'm a Liberal."" From what's provided there are multiple cover versions by different artists. The context mentions that these covers often have updated lyrics but it doesn't specify the meanings of the original song.   I know that sometimes songs can be reinterpreted in various ways depending on the artist or the cultural context at the time they perform. Without specific information about the original version I can only speculate based on the cover versions provided.  The song's title suggests a relationship between loving someone and identifying as a liberal. The mention of updated lyrics implies that each performer might twist it to fit their own style or perspective. For example Jello Biafra is known for his political activism so maybe he took a more radical stance in the original version. Mojo Nixon who's performed with several left-leaning artists might have brought a similar viewpoint.  Kevin Devine and Gerd Schinkel are likely to reference The Clash which was known for its political themes. Evan Greer is part of the alt-rock scene so his take would probably be more introspective or alternative. John Yannis has a Left Bank/post-punk style which often includes social commentary. Nacho Vegas (es) and Oscar Brand might have more electronic or progressive takes on it.  Without the original lyrics or more context I can't give a precise meaning. But based on these covers each artist probably interprets the song through their own lens of libera... wait that's ""liberal"" with an 'l' not 'f'. So they might be highlighting liberalism as a positive force or critique it in some way.  I should note that the answer is speculative because I don't have access to the original song. Covers can change the song's message entirely through reimagining lyrics and arrangements.  The meaning of ""Love Me I'm a Liberal"" varies across its cover versions due to reinterpretation by different artists.

Question: what is cost of first class mail stamp
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the cost of a first-class mail stamp based on the provided context. Let me go through the data step by step.  First looking at the dates and rates I notice that most entries mention ""06"" for letters and packages after March 3 1863. Then in October 1883 it drops to ""04 "" which is $0.04 per ounce. July 1 1898 it's again ""02 "" so $0.02 each.  In 1917 and 1928 the rate goes up a bit but by 1952 it's back to $0.03 per ounce for letters and packages. Then in 1958 it increases to $0.04 which I think might be due to inflation or some policy change.  Looking further into 1963 and 1968 the rate is $0.05 each. By 1971 it's $0.08 for letters and packages but then in 1974 and 1975 it goes up to $0.10 per ounce.  In 1978 there's a stamp labeled as A which is $15. Then later stamps from 1981 onwards go higher with some being used for specific purposes or during war times. The most recent rate in May 2015 is $49 but that's probably for larger packages or bulk mail.  Wait I'm trying to recall if the context mentions any standard rates beyond this list. It seems like after a certain point especially with the introduction of forever stamps and different pricing structures the rates might vary based on weight. However the question is about the ""cost of first class mail stamp "" which typically refers to the base rate per ounce.  Looking back at the data from 1863 onwards until some specific dates in the early 20th century the cost was either $0.02 or $0.04 per ounce for letters and packages. Then it jumped higher around 1958 to $0.08 then $0.10 in 1974.  But wait I think I might be mixing up letters and packages. The user is asking specifically about the ""cost of first class mail stamp "" which usually refers to the base rate per ounce for letters. So from March 3 1863 it was $0.06 per half ounce so that's $0.12 per ounce? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.  Wait no looking again: ""Rate for first ounce (Letter)"" is listed as .06 in some cases. But the context says "".03 per half ounce "" which would make each ounce 0.06 * 2 = $0.12? Hmm but that doesn't match later entries where it's just $0.04 or $0.08.  Wait no perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The first entry is March 3 1863: .06 for letters and packages with a note about half ounce rates. So maybe the rate per ounce was 0.06 in those terms. Then from 1883 it went to $0.04 then back to $0.02.  So if I'm looking for a standard cost over time perhaps the most recent ones are higher. But since the question is asking without context of specific dates maybe the answer refers to the most common current rate or based on historical data.  Wait but in 2015 one of the stamps was $49 for three ounces which would make each ounce about $3. So that's a recent high. But I think as of now the standard first-class rate might be around $0.47 per ounce but that's probably for larger quantities or bulk mail.  But since the context doesn't provide current rates beyond 2015 and includes some stamps up to $49 in May 2015 perhaps the answer is based on the most recent data provided. Alternatively if considering standard first-class postage without additional charges it's likely around $0.47 per ounce as of 2016.  Wait I'm a bit confused because some entries mention specific increases after 2008 like to $49 in May 2015 and then later that same year was updated to $47 etc. but those are probably for special cases or bulk mail. The standard rate might be lower.  Alternatively perhaps the answer refers to a specific entry like the most recent one before the data ends which is $36 (from April 2016) but that's not in the provided context; actually looking back the last entries go up to May 2015 with $49.  Hmm. Maybe I should look for a consistent rate over time. The most frequent rates are around $0.02 and $0.04 per ounce in earlier years but as of recent data it's higher. Since the user is asking about the cost without specifying a date perhaps the answer refers to the last known standard rate before special stamps or bulk mail.  Wait looking at the table again after 1975 there are stamps with higher values like A ($15) B ($20) etc. but those might be for specific uses beyond standard first-class. The most recent regular first-class rates would probably still be around $36 to $47 per ounce for bulk mail in some years.  But I think the user is asking about the typical cost so maybe it's best to note that as of 2015 a three-ounce package could cost up to $49. However without specific dates it's hard to pinpoint. Alternatively perhaps the answer refers to the highest rate provided which is around $36 in April 2016.  Wait no looking at the table again:   - In May 2015: 49 for 3 oz - Then in April 2016: 47 for 3 oz - January 2017: 49.25 (I think) but that's not in the context.  Wait actually looking at the table:  - May 29 1978: A stamp is $15. - Then various stamps with higher values up to Nondet in 2006 and so on.  But for first-class mail regular rates without special stamps or bulk mail perhaps it's lower. The last entry in the context is:  January 27 2013: 46 (3 oz) $2.07  Wait no looking at the table again:  Wait actually I think I'm getting confused between stamps and regular rates.  In any case without more specific data beyond what's provided perhaps the answer should state that the cost varies over time but as of recent years it can be around $36 to $47 per ounce for bulk mail. However since the user is asking about a first-class stamp which might refer to standard letters rather than packages.  But in the context most entries are for ""first ounce (Letter)"" and ""first ounce (Package)."" So perhaps the answer refers to both.  Wait the question is just asking for the cost of a first-class mail stamp so it's likely referring to the base rate per ounce. From 1863 onwards until around 1928 the letter rate was $0.06 per half ounce which would be $0.12 per ounce? But that doesn't match other entries where it's $0.04 or $0.02.  Wait no I think the confusion is arising because ""first ounce"" in letters and packages might have different rates. The initial rate was 06 for half ounce so each whole ounce would be twice that making it 12 cents? But then from 1883 onwards it went to $0.04 per first ounce (which is a whole ounce) meaning 4 cents.  So perhaps the most recent regular letter rate is around $0.47 as of some entries in 2016. Alternatively considering bulk mail rates are higher but standard letters might have lower costs.  Wait I'm getting stuck. Let me try to list out the key points:  - March 3 1863: Letters and packages at .06 (half ounce) - 1883: .04 per first ounce - 1898: .02 per first ounce - 1917: .03 for letters .03 for packages - 1928: dropped back to .02 - Then in 1952 1958 etc. rates increased to $0.04 or higher.  So the most recent standard letter rate before special stamps would be around $0.47 as of some entries in 2016. But without specific dates it's hard to say exactly.  Alternatively perhaps the answer is based on a specific entry like Nondet Stamps from 2002 at $37 for three ounces making each ounce about $12.33. But that seems too high.  Wait looking again:  - May 29 1978: A stamp used in March 22 2012 mentions ""46 (3 oz) $2.07 letters"" and ""$17 packages.""  So for three ounces it's $2.07 for letters and $17 for packages? That seems odd because package rates are much higher than letter rates.  Wait no looking again:  - In the table under May 29 1978: ""A Stamp Used March 22 2012 .18 .17 .12"" Wait that's confusing. Let me look at each row correctly.  Actually I think there might be formatting issues in the context provided. Each entry has:  Date Introduced | Rate for first ounce (Letter) | Rate for first ounce (Package) | Additional ounces ... | Comments  So from May 16 1971: 08 for both letter and package additional ounces at 06.  Then March 2 1974: 10 each.  May 16 is $0.08 for letters and packages which is lower than some previous rates but higher in recent years.  Wait no that seems contradictory because earlier rates went up to $0.10 by May 15 1975 then April 25 1978 has A stamp at 46 (3 oz) letters and something else. I'm getting confused with the entries.  I think the answer should be based on the most recent regular letter rates provided in the context. Looking through the table:  - The last regular rate before stamps for bulk mail is $0.47 per ounce as of April 25 1978? Wait no looking again:  In May 16 1971: Rate is 08 (probably $0.08) for letters and packages.  Then March 2 1974: Rate increased to 10 each.  So perhaps the most recent regular letter rate in the context is $0.10 per ounce as of 1975 but that's not correct because there are higher rates after that.  Wait no looking at May 16 1971: .08 for letters and packages. Then March 2 1974: .10 each.  So if the question is about the cost as of now or based on context up to May 2015 perhaps it's around $36 per ounce in April 2016 but that seems too high for standard letters. Alternatively considering bulk mail rates go up to $49 for three ounces which would be $16.33 per ounce.  But I think the user is asking about a single letter not a package or bulk. So perhaps the answer should reflect that as of recent data first-class postage for letters might be around $0.47 per ounce in some years but without specific dates it's hard to pinpoint exactly.  Alternatively considering the most common current rate based on historical context which goes up to 2016 at $36 per ounce for three ounces so each ounce is about $12? That seems high. Wait no let me check:  In April 25 1978: A stamp used in March 22 2012 mentions ""46 (3 oz) $2.07 letters"" and ""$17 packages."" So for three ounces letters are $2.07.  So per ounce: 2.07 / 3 = approximately $0.69 per ounce in that specific instance.  But this seems too high compared to other entries. Maybe the answer is based on the highest rate provided which would be around $49 for three ounces (as of May 2015).  Alternatively perhaps the answer should state that as of recent data first-class postage can cost up to a certain amount per ounce.  But since I'm supposed to provide the most accurate answer based on the context given and considering there are stamps up to $49 for three ounces in May 2015 but standard letters might have lower rates than that. However without specific data points it's hard to be precise.  I think the best approach is to note that as of some entries in the context first-class postage can cost up to $36 per ounce (from April 2016) but this seems inconsistent with typical historical rates where first-class letters were around $0.47 per ounce or so before bulk mail rates.  Wait no I think I'm confusing regular letters and packages with bulk mail. In the context for example in May 16 1971: .08 each for letter and package. Then March 2 1974: $0.10 each.  So perhaps the answer is that first-class letters cost around $0.10 per ounce as of some years but higher in others due to bulk mail rates.  But I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to conclude that based on historical data provided the most recent regular letter rate before stamps for bulk mail was up to $36 (as per one entry) so perhaps around there.  The cost of a first-class mail stamp varies over time. Based on the historical data provided:  - From 1863 onwards until around 1928 the rate was between 6 cents and 4 cents per ounce for letters and packages. - Starting in 1952 the rate increased to 4 cents for letters and 5 cents for packages. - In recent years (as of 2016) the cost can be as high as $36.00 for three ounces.  However it's important to note that these rates are subject to change over time due to inflation and postal service policies.  **Answer:** As of some entries in the provided context a first-class mail stamp can cost up to \$47.25 (for three ounces) as of April 2016 with higher costs possible for bulk mail.",answer as of some entries in provided context firstclass mail stamp can cost up to 4725 for three ounces as of april 2016 with higher costs possible for bulk mail,47 cents,0,0.0,27.159100599994417,0.00967992025914888,0.002842223899246575,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when was the land rover defender first built
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out when the Land Rover Defender was first built based on the provided context. Let me go through the information step by step.  The context mentions that the Defender will have little resemblance to the DC100 and talks about the L663 model entering production in 2019. It also states that Land Rover is planning to produce between 60 000 to 80 000 units annually which beats a 1970 record of around 55 000 to 60 000 units.  Hmm the key point here is ""Land Rover Defender (L663) is reportedly due to enter production in 2019."" That seems like it's referring to when production started or began. So if it's entering production in 2019 that would mean construction likely began before then.  I don't see any information about a previous model year for the Defender beyond this entry into production. The mention of the DC100 makes me think it's a different model maybe from earlier. Since the current model is L663 and entering in 2019 I assume that the first production started around then.  Wait but sometimes companies have prototype testing or development before full-scale production starts. If production began in 2019 perhaps the first actual manufacturing happened a few years after that? But without specific details about when the first units rolled off the line it's safer to go with the year production started which is 2019.  So putting it all together the Land Rover Defender was first built in 2019.

Question: what type of artwork was created in the safavid empire
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what types of artwork were created during the Safavid Empire. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Safavid period. The Safavids were a significant Islamic dynasty that ruled from the late 15th century until the mid-18th century centered in modern-day Iran and Afghanistan. They were known for their art and architecture.  I remember that many empires during this time valued art and culture as part of their identity. Since they were predominantly Muslim the artwork would likely reflect Islamic styles. The art might include calligraphy which was common in Islamic art often inscribed with religious texts or names. So that's one type: calligraphy.  Then there are mosaic panels and tapestries. These were probably used as decorations in homes palaces and mosques. They often featured patterns and scenes that depicted religious stories or natural elements typical of the time when such craftsmanship was highly valued.  I also think about jewelry. Safavid art included intricate silverwork like filigree and jeweled ornaments. These pieces would have been both functional and decorative maybe even used for display in homes or public spaces as symbols of wealth and status.  Pottery is another area. The Safavids were skilled potters so there must be beautiful earthenware vessels created. These could have been for daily use religious rituals or as status symbols like luxury urns that cost a lot to make but were considered valuable by the elite.  Inland art forms might include painting and drawing. The Safavids valued visual arts too so they probably produced paintings in various styles maybe imitations of Western art from that period or original works with Islamic themes. Calligraphers would have been part of this as well contributing to the overall artistic quality.  So putting it all together the types of artwork created during the Safavid Empire include calligraphy mosaics and tapestries jewelry like silverwork earthenware pottery and inland art such as painting and drawing. Each served different purposes but contributed to the empire's cultural and religious identity.  The artwork created during the Safavid Empire includes:  1. **Calligraphy**: Often featuring inscriptions with religious texts or names. 2. **Mosaics and Tapestries**: Decorative panels used in homes palaces and mosques depicting religious stories or natural scenes. 3. **Silverwork Jewelry**: Intricate designs like filigree symbolizing wealth and status. 4. **Earthenware Pottery**: Vessels for daily use or as luxury items showcasing advanced craftsmanship. 5. **Inland Art**: Paintings and drawings in various styles sometimes imitating Western works or featuring Islamic themes.

Context: The False Claims Act , also called the `` Lincoln Law '' ) is an American federal law that imposes liability on persons and companies ( typically federal contractors ) who defraud governmental programs . It is the federal Government 's primary litigation tool in combating fraud against the Government .

Question: what is a whistle blower suit under the false claims act
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out what a whistleblower suit under the False Claims Act is. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  The context mentions that the False Claims Act also known as the Lincoln Law is an American federal law that imposes liability on people and companies who defraud government programs. It's used by the federal government to combat fraud against them.  A key point in the context is the ""qui tam"" provision. Quoting from the context: ""The law includes a qui tam provision that allows people who are not affiliated with the government called 'relators' under the law to file actions on behalf of the government... Persons filing under the Act stand to receive a portion (usually about 15-25 percent) of any recovered damages.""  So a whistleblower suit is essentially someone acting as a relator. They're not part of the government but can bring claims on their own behalf or for an organization they work with. These individuals are called relators because they file the lawsuit under the qui tam provision.  The context also explains that these suits are often initiated by whistleblowers especially when the relator is employed by the organization involved in the suit. The damages recovered under this law typically relate to health care or military programs but have led to significant settlements in pharmaceutical cases as well.  In 2012 over 70% of federal FCA actions were started by these relators. Additionally about $38.9 billion was recovered between 1987 and 2013 with 70% coming from qui tam cases.  So putting this together: a whistleblower suit under the False Claims Act is when someone not connected to the government files a lawsuit claiming they were defrauded by a federal contractor or government entity. They receive a share of any damages recovered.  A whistleblower suit under the False Claims Act or ""quiam "" occurs when an individual known as a relator not affiliated with the government files a lawsuit to assert fraud against it. Relators typically receive 15-25% of recoveried damages. These suits often originate from whistleblowers especially within organizations involved in the case.", whistleblower suit under false claims act or quiam occurs when individual known as relator not affiliated with government files lawsuit to assert fraud against it relators typically receive 1525 of recoveried damages these suits often originate from whistleblowers especially within organizations involved in case,qui tam,0,0.0,3.6238381000002846,0.0012731046533261657,0.00037380973965211263,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: The flag of the Netherlands ( Dutch : Vlag van Nederland ) is a horizontal tricolor of red , white , and blue . The tricolor flag is almost identical to that of Luxembourg , except that it is shorter and its blue stripe is a darker shade .
Question: what are the colors of the netherlands flag
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the colors of the Netherlands flag based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says ""The flag of the Netherlands (Dutch: Vlag van Nederland) is a horizontal tricolor of red white and blue."" That's pretty straightforward. It mentions that it's a tricolor which means three colors arranged vertically on a flag. So from top to bottom or vice versa those are the three main colors.  It also compares the Netherlands' flag to Luxembourg's noting that they're almost identical except for some differences in size and shade of blue. But since the question is only about the Netherlands I can ignore the comparison unless it affects the answer. However looking at the first part there's no mention of any other country's colors affecting the main ones.  So putting it together the flag has three horizontal stripes: red white and blue. That means when you look at the flag starting from one end to the other you'll see these colors stacked on top of each other in that specific order. Each stripe is equally wide because it's a tricolor.  I should make sure I'm not adding any extra information or confusing it with another country. For example sometimes flags can have multiple tricolors or different arrangements but here it's clearly stated as red white and blue arranged horizontally.  The flag of the Netherlands has three horizontal colors: red at the top followed by white in the middle and blue at the bottom.

Question: what are the first and second major religions in france
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out the first and second major religions in France based on the provided context. Let me start by reading the question again carefully.  The user is asking for the two main religions present in France according to the given data. The context includes a table with percentages of different religions over the years 1986 1994 2007 and 2016.   Looking at the table I notice that under ""Religious group Population %"" there are several entries like Christianity Catholicism Protestantism Other and unaffiliated Christians Islam Judaism Other religions and unspecified and Not religious.  First I should identify which religion has the highest percentage in recent years to determine the first major religion. From the data:  - In 2016 Christianity is at 51.1% Catholicism at 48.9%. So it looks like Christianity is more prevalent than Catholicism in 2016.  Wait but I need to check all the years because percentages can change over time. For example in 1986 Christianity was 82% which seems high and it dropped a bit each subsequent year until 2016 at 51.1%. Catholicism started at 81% in 1986 and went down to 48.9% by 2016.  So the highest percentage for any religion is in 1986 with Christianity at 82% but since we're looking for the current or main religions today based on recent data (up to 2016) Christianity is still the first major religion because it's higher than Catholicism by a significant margin.  For the second I see that Catholicism has been consistently high each year. In 2016 it was at 48.9% which is slightly less than Christianity but much higher than other religions like Protestantism (3%) or Islam (5.6%). So it makes sense that Catholicism is the second major religion.  Other religions and unspecified include Not religious which has been increasing each year but that's more about non-religion not a specific religion. The 'Other and unaffiliated Christians' group also shows some presence in later years but their percentages are lower than both Christianity and Catholicism.  Wait the data mentions 'Other and unaffiliated Christians - - 5 % -' which I assume refers to a specific year (2016?) with 5% but it's unclear. Regardless even if that adds up Christianity as a whole is much higher than other categories.  So putting it all together the first major religion in France based on this data seems to be Christianity and the second would be Catholicism.

Question: who played sandy's jock boyfriend in grease
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who played Sandy's jock boyfriend in the movie ""Grease."" From what I remember Sandy is played by Richard BRADY. But wait he had a crush on Sandy and was her boyfriend too? Or was that a different character?  I think in the movie Sandy's boyfriend isn't one of the main characters. The main jock is Tony Scott played by Jack Palance. But the guy who plays Sandy's love interest might be someone else.  Wait I'm getting confused here. Let me try to recall. In ""Grease "" there are several guys with girlfriends: Danny Zuko as T-Bird played by John Travolta; Jocelyn Easton played by Jane Lynch; and Tony Scott as the lead jock. So who is Sandy's boyfriend?  I think it was another character maybe an older guy. Oh right I remember hearing that Richard BRADY had a crush on Sandy but didn't get to play her lead in the movie because they were siblings or something.  So since BRADY was Sandy's boyfriend his actor must be Jack Palance? No wait Jack Palance is Tony Scott who's the main jock. So that can't be it.  Wait maybe the answer is that Richard BRADY didn't play Sandy's boyfriend because they were siblings and therefore couldn't be in a romantic relationship on screen. Instead the movie went with another character for the lead role.  So to sum up: The question is asking who played Sandy's jock boyfriend which was actually played by Richard BRADY as T-Bird. Wait no that can't be right because T-Bird isn't a jock; he's from a greaser gang. So maybe the answer is Richard BRADY himself had a crush but wasn't in the movie.  But looking back at my earlier thought process I'm getting mixed up between the characters. The correct information must be that the actor who played Sandy's boyfriend was actually a different person because Richard BRADY couldn't do it due to being her brother or something else. Or maybe it's that Jack Palance wasn't in the role either.  Wait no in ""Grease "" Sandy's relationship is with Tony Scott but I think they were friends rather than a boyfriend girlfriend situation. So perhaps the correct answer is that Richard BRADY didn't play her boyfriend because he was her older brother and couldn't be in a romantic role together. Instead the movie went with T-Bird as her lead.  So to clarify: Sandy's jock boyfriend wasn't portrayed by anyone else; instead it was Richard BRADY who had a crush on her but couldn't play that role because of sibling issues.  The actor who played Sandy's jock boyfriend in ""Grease"" is Richard Bradys.

Question: who won the fountain of youth stakes at gulfstream park
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream Park. I'm not too familiar with horse racing details but I know that the Fountain of Youth Stakes is a significant event in horse racing often associated with the Triple Crown.  From what I remember the Fountain of Youth is one of the early races on the Kentucky Derby prep circuit. It's usually run at Gulfstream Park and precedes the actual Kentucky Derby. The winner of this race gets closer to earning the Triple Crown which includes winning the Kentucky Derby Preakness and the Belmont Stakes.  I think the most famous person to win the Fountain of Youth was Secretariat. He won it in 1964 along with the Kentucky Derby that same year. That's why he was so close to achieving the Triple Crown before the Preakness. So if I'm looking for who won specifically at Gulfstream Park Secretariat would be a strong candidate.  Wait but there might have been others as well. Maybe some of the other big names like Appomattox or Citation?

Each scene has specific locations mentioned such as Burnham Beeches in Buckinghamshire for an outlaws' encampment Aysgarth Falls in Yorkshire for a fight scene Hardraw Force also in Yorkshire and places like Sycamore Gap on Hadrian's Wall and Chalk cliffs at Seven Sisters in Sussex.

Question: who sang last night on saturday night live
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who sang on Saturday Night Live last night with a Halloween or horror theme. The context given is just the title of the show's segment which mentions ""Halloween and horror-themed sketches.""   I'm not exactly sure off the top of my head who was up next for that specific episode but I can try to recall any recent SNL segments I've heard about. There's a mix between comedy and the theme here so maybe it's someone from a musical or has been part of previous musical performances on SNL.  I remember that musical acts have sometimes come up on SNL especially if they're popular or have been in the news. Maybe someone like Taylor Swift? But I'm not sure she sang on SNL specifically. There's also Dolly Parton with her duet ""Jolene "" but I don't think that was a segment.  Wait maybe it's from a musical play or something they did for a special. Or perhaps it's someone who's currently big in the music industry and has performed on SNL before. Maybe Taylor Swift hasn't done one recently so maybe someone else like ... Hmm this is tricky. I think I might be mixing up different shows or moments. Let me try to break it down.  Since the context mentions Halloween and horror themes maybe the act was more on the comedic side with some spooky elements. But since the user asked for who sang not danced or acted in a sketch it's probably a singer.  I think about past SNL segments where singers performed. There was a segment with Dolly Parton once I believe. Maybe she did something musical? Or perhaps someone else like Celine Dion?  Alternatively maybe it's someone from a more recent act that has been performing on TV shows. There's been talk about some performers doing special guest spots recently.  Wait there's also the possibility that it was a duet or part of a musical number with multiple singers. For example Mariah Carey and Celine Dion have done collaborations before but I'm not sure if they've performed on SNL.  Alternatively maybe it's someone like Adam Levine? He's done some performances in the past. But I can't recall specifically.  I might be overcomplicating this. Since I don't have access to specific episode recordings or detailed episode guides from last night perhaps there was no singing act that week on SNL with a theme. Or maybe it's a segment where the main act was a musical number but they didn't highlight it as a solo performance.  Alternatively could it be that the segment wasn't actually performed by someone in front of a mic? Maybe it was a sketch about a musical group or something related to the theme without an actual singer performing.  I'm going around in circles here. Let me think differently. If I were to make an educated guess based on past knowledge perhaps Dolly Parton sang on SNL at some point. But I can't confirm that right now.  Wait maybe it's someone like Mariah Carey? I know she has been a guest on SNL before. She did a duet with Celine Dion once. If the theme was musical maybe she was up next.

Context: The administrative weight of these proclamations is upheld because they are often specifically authorized by congressional statute , making them `` delegated unilateral powers . '' Presidential proclamations are often dismissed as a practical presidential tool for policy making because of the perception of proclamations as largely ceremonial or symbolic in nature . However , the legal weight of presidential proclamations suggests their importance to presidential governance .
Question: where does the president get authority to issue executive orders
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the President gets the authority to issue executive orders based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that these proclamations have administrative weight because they're often specifically authorized by congressional statute making them ""delegated unilateral powers."" That part is a bit dense but I think it's saying that the President can issue these orders with some legal backing from Congress.   Then it talks about how presidential proclamations are often dismissed as mainly ceremonial or symbolic but their legal weight suggests they're important for governance. So even though people might see them as just symbols legally they hold some authority.  Putting this together I think the key point is that the President's executive orders come from congressional statutes. The context uses the term ""delegated unilateral powers "" which probably means Congress has given the President certain exclusive authority to make these proclamations. So the answer should be about congressional statute authorizing the President.  The President receives authority to issue executive orders primarily through congressional statute which delegates specific unilateral powers to him.", president receives authority to issue executive orders primarily through congressional statute which delegates specific unilateral powers to him,rooted in Article II of the US Constitution or enacted by the congress in statutes,0,0.0,2.0144952999980887,0.0006872274515806507,0.00020178412991106462,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: The phrase `` to form a more perfect Union '' has been construed as referring to the shift to the Constitution from the Articles of Confederation . In this transition , the `` Union '' was made `` more perfect '' by the creation of a federal government with enough power to act directly upon citizens , rather than a government with narrowly limited power that could act on citizens ( e.g. , by imposing taxes ) only indirectly through the states . Although the Preamble speaks of perfecting the `` Union , '' and the country is called the `` United States of America , '' the Supreme Court has interpreted the institution created as a government over the people , not an agreement between the States . The phrase has also been interpreted to confirm that state nullification of any federal law , dissolution of the Union , or secession from it , are not contemplated by the Constitution .
Question: how does the us government form a more perfect union
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out how the US government forms a ""more perfect union"" based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that the phrase refers to transitioning from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution. In this shift the Union became more perfect by creating a federal government with enough power to act directly on citizens unlike the old system where states acted indirectly through them maybe imposing taxes or things like that.  So the key point here is that forming a ""more perfect union"" involves moving from a weaker central government (under the Articles of Confederation) to a stronger federal one as outlined in the Constitution. The new system allows the federal government to exercise more direct authority over citizens which supposedly makes the Union better or more effective.  I think the answer should focus on this shift and the powers given to the federal government in the Constitution that enable it to act directly on citizens. Maybe also mention how this avoids state-level actions that could limit the Union's strength.  The US government forms a ""more perfect union"" by transitioning from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution creating a stronger federal system where the government can directly exercise authority over citizens through its powers under the Constitution avoiding indirect state actions.", us government forms more perfect union by transitioning from articles of confederation to constitution creating stronger federal system where government can directly exercise authority over citizens through its powers under constitution avoiding indirect state actions,"the creation of a federal government with enough power to act directly upon citizens, rather than a government with narrowly limited power that could act on citizens (e.g., by imposing taxes) only indirectly through the states",0,0.23880597014925375,2.2865720999980113,0.0007817164208984086,0.00022952803684627744,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what makes a mini bike a mini bike
Answer: ",Alright so I'm trying to figure out what makes a mini bike a mini bike. From the context given it says that a minibike is sometimes called a minimoto or pocketbike and is a miniature motorcycle. It also mentions that most use two-stroke engines and chain drive.  Hmm okay so the key points are that it's a small motorcycle (minibike) often referred to by other names like minimoto or pocketbike and that they usually have two-stroke engines and chain drive.  I think the main characteristics would be its size being miniaturized compared to regular motorcycles. Also using two-stroke engines instead of four-stroke ones might make it lighter and more efficient. The fact that they use a chain drive suggests it's built differently from standard bikes which have a belt or some other type of transmission.  So putting this together the answer should focus on its size being mini referring to it as a motorcycle using two-stroke engines and having chain drive.  A mini bike is called a mini bike because it is a small motorcycle (minibike) often referred to by names like minimoto or pocketbike. It typically uses two-stroke engines and chain drive for efficiency and lightweight construction., mini bike is called mini bike because it is small motorcycle minibike often referred to by names like minimoto or pocketbike it typically uses twostroke engines and chain drive for efficiency and lightweight construction,a miniature motorcycle,0,0.05555555555555555,2.220191000000341,0.0007564800329467782,0.00022211811372227345,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: which horse and jockey won the melbourne cup in 2002
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which horse and jockey won the Melbourne Cup in 2002 using the provided context. Let me start by understanding what's given here.  The context is a list of entries that look like racehorses with their respective names jockeys and perhaps other details like positions or notes. Each row has two parts: one on the left and another in parentheses probably indicating some position or additional information. For example the first entry says ""Place Name Jockey Media Puzzle Damien Oliver Mr. Prudent C. Brown Beekeeper Kerrin McEvoy Vinnie Roe Pat Smullen Pentastic G. Boss 6 Distinctly Secret S. King 7...""  Wait that's a bit confusing. It seems like each line has two main columns: one with the horse name and jockey and another in parentheses which might be additional info or maybe place numbers. The first part is probably structured as Horse Name Jockey.  So I need to parse this correctly. Let me look at each entry:  1. ""Place Name Jockey Media Puzzle Damien Oliver Mr. Prudent C. Brown Beekeeper Kerrin McEvoy Vinnie Roe Pat Smullen Pentastic G. Boss 6 Distinctly Secret S. King 7...""  Wait that's a lot to take in. Maybe it's structured as Horse Name | Jockey | additional info. So ""Media Puzzle"" is the horse name and ""Damien Oliver Mr. Prudent C. Brown"" is the jockey? Or maybe each pair is horse and jockey.  Alternatively perhaps each row represents a horse with its jockey in parentheses. For example:  1. Media Puzzle (Damien Oliver) ...   But looking at it again: ""Media Puzzle Damien Oliver Mr. Prudent C. Brown Beekeeper Kerrin McEvoy..."" Hmm maybe it's not that straightforward.  Wait the user provided this as a context and wants me to answer which horse and jockey won the Melbourne Cup in 2002. So perhaps each row is a horse with its jockey listed next to it.  But looking at the numbers: 6 Distinctly Secret S. King 7... Maybe that's the position or something else like race number? But I'm not sure.  Alternatively maybe each line has two entries: the first part as Horse Name and Jockey then another set of data in parentheses.  Wait perhaps it's structured as:  Horse Name | Jockey | Other info  So for example: - Media Puzzle (Damien Oliver) - Beekeeper (Kerrin McEvoy) - Pentastic (Mr. Prudent C. Brown) And so on.  If that's the case I can list each horse with their jockey next to it as of 2002 then figure out which one won the Melbourne Cup.  I know that the Melbourne Cup is a famous race in Australian thoroughbred racing held at the Australian thoroughbred Racing Board and is often considered one of the most prestigious races. The winner in 2002 was ""Victory Smile "" ridden by Frankie Dettori who also won the race the following year.  But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct so let me check this context provided.  Looking through the list:  Line 18: Prized Gem M. Rodd Line 19: Victory Smile D. Beasley  Wait that would mean ""Victory Smile"" is horse number 19 and jockey is D. Beasley? But earlier I thought it was Frankie Dettori. Maybe the context here doesn't have that information.  Alternatively perhaps the jockey for Victory Smile in this list is D. Beasley but I might be wrong because I remember Frankie Dettori winning it twice around 2003-2004.  Hmm maybe there's a mistake in the context provided or my memory. Alternatively maybe I should focus on extracting horse names and jockeys from the given data to see if ""Victory Smile"" is included.  Looking at the numbers:  Numbers go up to 23. Let me list them out with their possible horse names and jockeys based on the pattern.  1. Media Puzzle - C. Brown (Mr. Prudent) Wait maybe the format is: Horse Name | Jockey  So first entry: Media Puzzle | Mr. Prudent C. Brown Beekeeper | Kerrin McEvoy Pentastic | Vinnie Roe G. Boss | Pat Smullen Distinctly Secret | S. King Jardines Lookout | G. Childs Miss Meliss | N. Harris Thong Classic | D. Gauci Grey Song | M. Rodd Daliapour Mick | C. Munce Cyclades | S. Seamer Pugin | Frankie Dettori (Wait line 19: Victory Smile D. Beasley) Victory Smile is listed as horse number 18? Or perhaps the numbering is off.  Alternatively maybe each line has two entries:  For example: ""Media Puzzle | DAMIEN OLIVER MR. PRUDENT C. BROWN"" ""Beekeeper | KERRIN MCEVoy""  But that might be complicated to parse.  Wait looking again at the first few lines:  1. Place Name Jockey Media Puzzle Damien Oliver Mr. Prudent C. Brown Beekeeper Kerrin McEvoy Vinnie Roe Pat Smullen Pentastic G. Boss 6 Distinctly Secret S. King 7...  This seems like a table with two columns: the first column is ""Place Name Jockey"" and the second is ""Horse Beekeeper..."" but that might not make sense.  Perhaps each row has two entries:  First entry: Place Name | Jockey Second entry: Horse | Other info  So for example:  Place 1: Media Puzzle | Jockey Mr. Prudent C. Brown Place 2: Beekeeper | Kerrin McEvoy And so on.  Wait that doesn't seem to fit because each place would have a horse and jockey pair.  Alternatively perhaps the first column is ""Horse Name"" and the second is ""Jockey "" but with some data in between.  It's getting confusing. Maybe I should look for any mentions of 2002 in this context or check if any known winners are listed.  Looking at horse names:  - Victory Smile D. Beasley (horse number 19) - Pentastic G. Boss - Media Puzzle C. Brown - Beekeeper Kerrin McEvoy  Wait I think ""Victory Smile"" won the Melbourne Cup in 2003 with jockey Frankie Dettori. But if this context doesn't mention him maybe the winner here is someone else.  Alternatively perhaps ""Pentastic G. Boss"" won in 2002? Not sure.  But given that I think Frankie Dettori won it twice around 2003-2004 but let's see if he's listed here as jockey for Victory Smile on line 19 with D. Beasley. So maybe the correct answer is that Victory Smile was ridden by D. Beasley in 2002.  Wait I might be overcomplicating this. The user provided a list of horses and their jockeys up to horse number 23 (S. Arnokld). But the question is about 2002. So perhaps among these ""Victory Smile"" is one of them with jockey D. Beasley.  Alternatively maybe I should look for any horse that won in 2002 from this list. But since I don't have exact data on each race's winner beyond the names and jockeys it's tricky.  Wait perhaps the user expects me to pick based on my general knowledge that the 2002 Melbourne Cup was won by Victory Smile with Frankie Dettori but if in this context ""Victory Smile"" is listed as horse number 19 with jockey D. Beasley then maybe that's the answer.  Alternatively perhaps I should focus solely on the data provided and extract names and jockeys for each horse to see which one was ridden by whom in 2002 assuming that's within the range of this context.  So based on my analysis it seems that ""Victory Smile"" won the Melbourne Cup in 2002 with jockey D. Beasley.  The horse and jockey who won the Melbourne Cup in 2002 were Victory Smile ridden by D.

Looking specifically for ice skating I see ""Ice Skating"" listed under the events. The announcers for that are Ted Robinson Bill Spaulding (who appears several times) Andrea Joyce twice A.J.

Question: what type of legal system is used in the uk
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the type of legal system used in the UK based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.  The context talks about the National Assembly for Wales which is a legislative body with specific electoral methods but doesn't mention anything directly about the UK's legal system. It describes how the assembly works and its structure so that seems unrelated to the main question about the UK's legal system.  Since the context only discusses Wales' assembly and not England or Scotland I can infer that it doesn't cover the broader UK legal system. The National Assembly for Wales operates under a parliamentary system similar to the rest of the UK but again the details provided don't specify what kind of legal system exists in the UK.  I know from general knowledge that the UK uses a parliamentary system with a constitutional monarchy. The legal system is majorly Common Law influenced by English law. However without any mention in the context about this I can't be certain. But given the information provided doesn't talk about England or Scotland's systems either it might not cover the main question.  Wait maybe the question was about Wales? No the question is specifically about the UK. Since the context doesn't provide details on that perhaps the answer isn't in the context at all. But since I have to provide an answer based on the given context which only mentions the National Assembly for Wales without discussing the broader legal system of the UK maybe the intended answer was about the Welsh system?  No the question is asking about the UK's legal system so it must be that the context implicitly refers to England and Scotland as part of the UK when talking about the parliamentary structure. But again no explicit information on the legal system.  Alternatively perhaps the context implies a representative system because it mentions proportional representation in the assembly. So maybe it's asking whether the UK is a parliamentary or representative system? But that doesn't directly answer the type of legal system like Common Law.  Hmm this is confusing. Since the context doesn't specify the legal system but describes the structure and electoral method of the National Assembly for Wales I might have to conclude that the intended answer was about the parliamentary system. However the user's question specifically asks about the UK's legal system type so perhaps it's expecting Common Law as the answer.  Wait no the context doesn't mention anything about the legal system types like Common Law or civil law; it's more about the assembly structure and elections. So maybe I should answer that there's insufficient information provided in the context to determine the type of legal system used in the UK.  But since the user is asking for a direct answer perhaps they expect me to infer based on the mention of proportional representation implying a representative system within the parliamentary framework.  The context does not provide specific details about the type of legal system used in the UK. It focuses on the National Assembly for Wales and its structure but does not elaborate on the broader legal system of England or Scotland which together constitute the United Kingdom.

Context: At Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) on June 8 , 2009 , it was announced that the 13 - inch unibody MacBook would be upgraded and re-branded as a MacBook Pro , leaving only the white polycarbonate MacBook in the MacBook line . It was also announced that the entire MacBook Pro line would use the non user - removable battery first introduced in the 17 - inch MacBook Pro . The updated MacBook Pro 13 - and the 15 - inch would each have up to a claimed seven hours of battery life , while the 17 - inch would keep its eight - hour capacity . Some sources even reported up to eight hours of battery life for the 13 - and 15 - inch MacBook Pros during casual use , while others reported around six hours . Like the 17 - inch MacBook Pro , Apple claims that they will last around 1,000 charge cycles while still containing 80 percent of their capacity . Graphics card options stayed the same from the previous release , although the 13 - inch and the base model 15 - inch , came with only the GeForce 9400M GPU . The screens were also improved , gaining a claimed 60 percent greater color gamut . All of these mid 2009 models also included a FireWire 800 port and all except the 17 - inch models would receive an SD card slot . The 17 - inch model would retain its ExpressCard / 34 slot .

The context mentions that at WWDC 2009 on June 8th Apple announced upgrades for the MacBook line. Specifically they rebranded the 13-inch unibody MacBook as the MacBook Pro. So right there I can note that the 13-inch MacBook Pro was introduced in 2009.  I also see that other models like the 15 and 17-inch versions were part of this update too. The context talks about the release details for these models but focuses on the 13-inch being a new model called the MacBook Pro at that time.

Context: The electrical conduction system of the heart transmits signals generated usually by the sinoatrial node to cause contraction of the heart muscle . The pacemaking signal generated in the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium to the atrioventricular node , along the Bundle of His and through bundle branches to cause contraction of the heart muscle . This signal stimulates contraction first of the right and left atrium , and then the right and left ventricles . This process allows blood to be pumped throughout the body .
Question: the heart muscle is stimulated to contract by electrical impulses which are generated where
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the electrical impulses that stimulate the heart muscle's contraction come from. The context provided explains how the heart's electrical conduction system works. It mentions that signals start in the sinoatrial node and then travel through various pathways to affect the heart muscles.  I remember that the sinoatrial node is often called the heart's pacemaker because it generates the electrical impulses needed for the heart to beat. So if the question is asking where these impulses are generated when the heart muscle contracts due to an electrical impulse it should be in the sinoatrial node.

Question: when did the cubs won a world series
Answer: ",Alright I need to figure out when the Chicago Cubs won a World Series based on the provided context. Let me go through the information step by step.  First under Major League Titles and National League Pennants it mentions that the Cubs have three World Series titles in 1907 1908 and 2016. So they've won the World Series multiple times over those years.   Looking at the specific years listed for National League Pennants I see 1907 is mentioned alongside World Series. Since a World Series title implies winning both a World Series and a pennant in the same year it's clear that 1907 was one of their successful years.  Then looking further down at Division titles the Central Division has wins in 2003 2007 2008 2016 and 2017. The East Division has wins in 1984 and 1989 but these are not directly related to World Series victories.  Focusing back on the World Series titles besides 1907 1908 and 2016 I need to check if there are any other years mentioned. The context doesn't list additional World Series titles beyond those three in 1907 1908 and 2016.  So compiling this information the Cubs won the World Series in 1907 1908 and again in 2016.  The Chicago Cubs won the World Series in 1907 1908 and 2016., chicago cubs won world series in 1907 1908 and 2016,2016,0,0.18181818181818182,3.045483599998988,0.001063145856870783,0.00031216151392643855,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when does shadowhunters season 2 episode 17 come out
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the second season of ""The Shadowhunters"" episode 17 comes out. Let me start by recalling what I know about the show and its seasons.  I remember that ""Shadowhunters"" is a TV show based on books by凡is set in New York City with various supernatural beings like vampires demons and warlocks. It has multiple seasons each with several episodes.  From the information provided it seems that each episode has a date associated with it showing when it was released or made. For example episode 1 is from July 2017 episode 3 is also from July but on a different day and so on. This pattern continues through multiple seasons labeled as season 1 through 6.  The user specifically asked about the release date for ""Shadowhunters"" season 2 episode 17. I know that each season typically has more than one episode often around eight to ten per season. Episode numbers run sequentially across all seasons unless there are spin-offs or special episodes.  However without checking the exact episode list or release dates for season 2 it's tricky to pinpoint the exact date of episode 17. I can try to remember if ""Shadowhunters"" has a consistent release schedule. It was renewed for a second season in May 2018 so probably around that time.  Typically TV shows release episodes weekly or bi-weekly on certain days often Mondays or Thursdays. But without knowing the exact air dates from previous seasons it's hard to extrapolate.   Alternatively maybe I can think about when the first season finale was released and estimate based on that. If the first season had 16 episodes ending around June 2017 then season two might start a few months later.  But since each episode has its own date in parentheses under the episode number perhaps I can use that information to find a pattern or release schedule for the show.  Looking at the given data:  For example episode 1 is July 10 2017. Episode 3 is July 17 2017.  Episode 6 on August 7 2017.  So each season might have multiple episodes spread out over a few months.   If I consider that the user provided episode numbers up to 33 and mentions season two perhaps episode 17 is in the second half of season one or early into season two.  But without having access to all the dates for season two it's hard to be precise. Maybe I can recall that ""Shadowhunters"" Season 2 typically has its episodes released around August 2018. Episode 1 might have been on a certain date in late May or early June of 2018.  But since each episode number corresponds to specific months and days like episode one being July 2017 perhaps episode 17 for season two would be later into the second season maybe around September 2018.  Alternatively considering that each season might have about eight episodes on average so episode 9-16 would be in the same season. So if episode 1 was July 2017 episode 9 could be around August or early September 2017 but since it's season two maybe a bit later.  Wait actually each date is under an episode number which suggests that some episodes from different seasons have overlapping numbers because the numbering continues after each season. So for example ""The Shadowhunters"" Season 1 has episodes numbered 1-32 or so and then Season 2 would continue with episode 33 onward.  So if I need to find when episode 17 of Season 2 comes out it's actually the 17th episode in the second season. So looking at the user's data perhaps they have only provided up to episode 33 as part of multiple seasons.  Wait no the user's information lists episodes from various seasons with numbers going up to episode 33 but each under their respective season titles. It seems like each season has its own set of episode dates.  But focusing on the question: when does ""Shadowhunters"" Season 2 Episode 17 come out? Given that it's part of the second season which was renewed in May 2018 likely around mid-2018.   Typically a TV show might air episodes weekly or bi-weekly on certain days. If we consider that each season has about 13 episodes (since the user listed up to episode 33 across multiple seasons) but I'm not sure.  Wait perhaps it's better to think of each date in parentheses as indicating when that particular episode was released. For example ""Episode 1: 2017-07-10"" suggests the first episode was released on July 10 2017. Similarly Episode 3 is July 17 2017.  So if we follow this pattern each subsequent episode in a season would be roughly a week apart or so. So to find when episode 17 of season two comes out perhaps it's around the time when the second season finale was released.  But without having the exact list for season two I can't say exactly. However considering that season one ended with the first season finale on June 28 2017 (as per episode 32) and season two started later in May 2018 the episodes would be released around that time.  Perhaps the 17th episode of season two was aired around late August or early September 2018. But since I don't have exact dates maybe it's safe to say it comes out around mid-2018.  The second season of ""Shadowhunters"" typically begins around May 2018. Episode 17 is likely to be released in late August or early September 2018 following the usual pattern of episode releases for that season.

Question: atlantic ocean's shape is similar to which english alphabet
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what the Atlantic Ocean's shape is similar to an English letter. Hmm let me visualize the Atlantic Ocean first. It stretches across the Northern Hemisphere bounded by the Eastern coast of Africa and the Western coast of Europe along with various islands and continents in between.  Now thinking about the shape... The Atlantic doesn't really have a distinct shape like some other bodies of water; it's more of an open expanse. But maybe if I compare its outline to letters perhaps part of it looks like one. Let me think about the English alphabet: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z.  The Atlantic's west coast is near Europe and the east coast near Africa. If I imagine a diagonal line from NorthWest to SouthEast maybe it forms something like an 'A' or maybe a 'V'. Wait actually when you look at maps the Atlantic doesn't form a specific letter; it just flows in a certain direction.  Alternatively perhaps if I think of the word ""Atlantic "" but that's not helpful. Maybe focusing on the east and west coasts: Europe is to the west Africa to the east. If I draw a line from west (Europe) down to the south towards Africa does it resemble any letter? Hmm maybe 'A'? The diagonal lines in an 'A' might somewhat represent that stretch.  Wait but isn't the Atlantic's shape more like an S or something else entirely? No actually the outline itself doesn't form a specific letter. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps it's meant to be associated with 'A' because of the word ""Atlantic."" So when you write 'A ' part of it resembles the Atlantic's stretching across Europe and Africa.  So putting that together maybe the answer is A.  The Atlantic Ocean's shape considering its extent from Europe to Africa along a diagonal is similar to the letter **A**.

Question: what is the central idea of the poem the rime of ancient mariner
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out the central idea of ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" based on the given context. Let me start by reading through the context provided.  It mentions that on the surface the poem explores a violation of nature and its psychological effects on the mariner and others who hear him. Then it talks about Jerome McGann describing the poem as a ""salvation story."" The structure is multi-layered based on Higher Criticism comparing it to works like the Iliad or Paradise Lost. It also says that the poem has transhistorical significance rather than universal which means its themes are timeless but don't apply universally.  So putting this together the surface level idea is about nature's violation and psychological impact. But since it's a ""salvation story "" maybe the central theme isn't just about the mariner's problem but something more positive. The transhistorical aspect suggests that the poem addresses universal human experiences—emotions like fear longing and hope.  I think the central idea is that the poem uses nature's violation as a way to convey deeper psychological or emotional truths that transcend time. It's not just about the mariner's personal struggle but about how such struggles resonate with everyone offering some form of redemption or understanding.  The central idea of ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" is that the poem uses nature's violation as a metaphor to explore universal human emotions and psychological states offering a salubrious narrative that transcends time.", central idea of rime of ancient mariner is that poem uses natures violation as metaphor to explore universal human emotions and psychological states offering salubrious narrative that transcends time,a violation of nature and the resulting psychological effects on the mariner and on all those who hear him,0,0.22222222222222224,2.6777411999937613,0.0009228176619229264,0.0002709582665089852,0.0,0.0,0.0

The context says that WWE recognizes Paul Jones as a two-time champion. It also mentions that his third reign is not recognized by WWE. Hmm so from this it seems like Paul Jones holds two titles in the WWE's history within the United States.  I remember that in wrestling champions often face off against each other and sometimes they have multiple reigns over the same title. But here it specifically mentions that only two are recognized for Paul Jones which probably means he hasn't been re-challenged since his second reign ended. On the other hand if someone else has a third reign recognized maybe they've successfully defended their title or won it through some process that WWE acknowledges.  So the question is about who has the most US championships. From what I gather Paul Jones leads with two.

Question: what is the written dialogue portion of a musical called
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what the written dialogue part in a musical is called based on the given context. Let me start by thinking about what I know about stage productions. In musical plays there's usually acting and singing parts but also the words that are spoken.   I remember from school that plays have acts with scenes which include dialogue. So maybe it's something like ""dialogue"" or a specific term related to that. Wait in the context provided they mentioned ""What OnStage Awards"" and a ""Best Regional Production Nominated."" That doesn't directly answer the question but might be about a competition or recognition.  I think there are terms for different parts of a musical beyond just acts. There's the music itself (score) then the dialogue. Maybe it's called the ""lyrics""? No wait lyrics specifically refer to the words in songs not all spoken parts. Or is there another term?  Wait maybe it's part of the script. The written part that's going to be spoken by actors would be their lines. So perhaps it's just referred to as the dialogue or script? I think the answer provided was ""dialogue "" so maybe that's correct.  But to make sure let me consider synonyms. There's also ""spoken words"" but that's too vague.

Hmm but I don't see any direct mention of the construction timeline or start date of the Titanic here.

So maybe I need to recall some general knowledge about the Titanic's construction since this question is based solely on the provided context.

Question: where does the largest amount of federal tax revenue come from
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the largest amount of federal tax revenue comes from based on the provided context. Let me go through this step by step.  First I'll look at the data given. There's a table with two main columns: State Gross Collections (in thousands) and Revenue per capita (estimated) along with the Ratio to GSP. The question is asking about the largest amount of federal tax revenue so I should focus on the ""State Gross Collections"" column since that represents the total tax revenues each state contributes.  I see that California has the highest gross collections at $405 851 295 (in thousands). To get the exact figure in dollars I need to multiply this by 1 000. So $405 851 295 * 1 000 equals $405 851 295 000.  I should also check if any other states have higher amounts. Let me scan the list:  - Texas: $279 904 425 000 - New York: $269 716 999 000 - Florida: $177 389 488 000 - Illinois: $158 042 273 000 - And so on.  All the other states have lower figures than California. Therefore California is clearly the state with the largest federal tax revenue contribution based on this data.

Question: when was the last time iran had an earthquake
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the last earthquake Iran had. Looking at the context provided there's a lot of data about earthquakes in different provinces and cities across Iran from various years.   First I'll scan through each entry to find the most recent date mentioned. The entries list events starting from as early as 1642 up to more recent dates like 2017 and even earlier. I'm looking specifically for the latest year when an earthquake occurred.  I notice there's a line that says ""2017 - 12 - 20 Tehran..."" which is December 20 2017. That seems pretty recent. Going through the other entries after that like the ones from October 2014 and August 2013 they all come before 2017. There's no entry that mentions a date after 2017 so it looks like December 2017 might be the last earthquake mentioned here.  I don't see any other entries with dates in 2018 or later so I can conclude that the last known earthquake in Iran according to this data was on December 20 2017.

Question: how many customers does edf have in the uk
Answer: ","Okay I need to find out how many customers EDF Energy has in the UK based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again.  The context says that EDF Energy employs 13 331 people and handles 5.7 million customer accounts. So they mention both the number of employees and the number of customer accounts. Since the question is about the number of customers I should focus on ""handles 5.7 million customer accounts.""   I think that in this context ""customer accounts"" refers to the total number of customers EDF serves. So the answer should be 5.7 million.

Question: who starred in the movie the day the earth stood still
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who starred in the movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" Let me start by going through the context provided.  First looking at the question it's asking for the actors involved. The context lists several names under the 'Starring' section: Keanu Reeves Jennifer Connelly Jaden Smith Kathy Bates Jon Hamm John Cleese Kyle Chandler. That seems to be all of them as main actors.  Wait but I also notice that in the question it's asking for who starred in the movie which is ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" The context doesn't mention if this is the same as ""Farewell to the Master"" since both are by Harry Bates and involve Keanu Reeves. So perhaps these actors appeared in both films.  But for the specific question about ""The Day the Earth Stood Still "" I should focus on the names listed under 'Starring.' The answer includes Keanu Reeves Jennifer Connelly Jaden Smith Kathy Bates Jon Hamm John Cleese and Kyle Chandler.   I don't need to add anything else because the user just wants concise answers without too much reasoning. So my final answer should list these actors as per the context provided.

Question: what is the setting of the book hoot
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the setting of the book ""Hoot."" From what I know ""Hoot"" is written by Carl Hiaasen and is part of the Johnisory series. The story involves Roy Eberhardt moving to Florida and getting into a bullying situation with Dana Matherson. There's also an incident where Roy runs into a boy outside but he gets injured when Dana chokes him.  Wait I'm trying to recall any details about the setting from what was provided earlier. It mentioned Roy moving to Coconut Cove in Florida and the school being there. But that context is about ""Hoot "" right? So maybe the settings are consistent across the series.   I think Carl Hiaasen's ""Hoot"" is set in a small isolated town called Coconut Cove on the Gulf Coast of Florida. The story follows Roy Eberhardt as he navigates his move to this new town and deals with the bullying incident. The setting seems pretty rural which makes sense because it's about a coastal town.   Also from what I remember Carl Hiaasen writes in a particular style that combines genres maybe some mystery or drama. So the setting plays into that by providing the backdrop where these events happen. The town being isolated and quiet allows for the tension to build up around Roy's experiences.  I don't think there are any other major settings beyond the town itself because ""Hoot"" is more focused on Roy's personal journey rather than exploring different locations or environments. So putting it all together the setting of ""Hoot"" should be Coconut Cove Florida.  The setting of the book ""Hoot"" by Carl Hiaasen is Coconut Cove Florida a small coastal town on the Gulf Coast. The story unfolds as Roy Eberhardt navigates his move to this isolated and quiet environment where he faces bullying and personal growth amidst the tension caused by an incident involving Dana Matherson.", setting of book hoot by carl hiaasen is coconut cove florida small coastal town on gulf coast story unfolds as roy eberhardt navigates his move to this isolated and quiet environment where he faces bullying and personal growth amidst tension caused by incident involving dana matherson,Florida and into the town of Coconut Cove,0,0.22641509433962262,3.292213200009428,0.001147535502325214,0.00033694005142862854,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when was the first horrid henry book written
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the first Horrid Henry book was written. Let me see... From the context provided it says that ""Horrid Henry is the first book of the Horrid Henry series."" It was published in 1994 and written by Francesca Simon with illustrations by Tony Ross. Also it mentions that the book is a collection of short stories about the same characters along the lines of the Just William books.  Alright so the key information here is the publication year. The context clearly states that it was published in 1994. Since the first book would naturally be from the year it was published I don't think there's any need to calculate anything beyond that. It doesn't say anything about the writing process duration or release dates for previous books because it's the first one.

Question: where do harry potter's aunt and uncle live
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where Harry Potter's aunt and uncle live. Let me start by recalling what I know from the context provided.  The context mentions that the Dursley family are Harry Potter's last living relatives. It also states that Albus Dumbledore placed Harry in their care when he was a baby because he was a wizard while the Dursleys themselves were Muggles. They live at Number 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging in Surrey England. All of them are Muggles and they don't like magic or anything out of the ordinary.  Wait so the question is about Harry's aunt and uncle not just his mother and father who are also Dursleys. I remember that in the books there's a character named Lily Dursley but she has two last names: Dursley and Evans. So she's Harry's aunt? Or is she more of an extended family member.  I think her husband is Colin Dursley so together they are considered Harry's parents by law because they took him in after James and Lily left. But actually the context says the Dursleys are Harry's last living relatives implying that maybe the author doesn't consider them his parents but since he refers to them as such elsewhere.  So if the Dursleys live at Number 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging then both Lily and Colin must live there too. Therefore Harry's aunt and uncle (Colin) are also part of that family living in the same address.  Harry Potter's aunt and uncle Lily and Colin Dursley live at Number 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey England.

Question: when was pac man released in the us
Answer: ",Alright I'm trying to figure out when Pac-Man was released in the US. Let me go through the context provided step by step.  First looking at the release dates given. The context mentions two release dates: one for Japan (JP) and another for the North America (NA). It says that Pac-Man was released on May 22 1980 in Japan. Then it goes on to note that in North America the release date is October 26 1980.  So the question specifically asks about the US release date. Since NA corresponds to the North American region which includes the US I can directly use the date provided for NA. That would be October 26 1980.  I don't see any conflicting information here; both regions have their own dates. Therefore it's safe to conclude that Pac-Man was released in the US on October 26 1980.  Pac-Man was released in the US on October 26 1980.  Answer: October 26 1980,october 26 1980,"October 26, 1980",1,1.0,2.1492200000066077,0.0007271342160377948,0.0002135015776425681,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who plays drew's boyfriend on the night shift
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out who plays Drew's boyfriend on the night shift in the given TV show episode list. Let me start by understanding the context.  First looking through the episodes provided each has a title and some details about the plot. The question is specifically about Drew's boyfriend during his night shift. So I'm looking for an episode where Drew is working at night and there's mention of someone who is his boyfriend or in a relationship with him.  Looking through each episode:  1. Episode 1: ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" - Drew tells Brianna that he and Rick want to adopt her and she’s thrilled. So here Drew has a boyfriend named Rick.  2. Episode 3: ""Trust Issues"" - Drew is working with Brianna but his girlfriend isn't mentioned in this episode.  3. Episode 10: ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" again? Wait that's the same as episode 1 so probably not relevant here.  Wait actually looking at each episode only one mentions Drew and Rick together: ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" where Drew tells Brianna about adopting her with Rick. So it seems that Drew's boyfriend is named Rick in this context.  I should double-check if there are other episodes where Drew has another relationship. But scanning through the others I don't see any other mentions of Drew having a boyfriend besides Rick.  So the answer should be that Drew's boyfriend during his night shift is Rick.  Drew's boyfriend during his night shift is **Rick**. This is mentioned in the episode titled ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place "" where Drew informs Brianna about their adoption plan involving Rick.",drews boyfriend during his night shift is rick this is mentioned in episode titled between rock and hard place where drew informs brianna about their adoption plan involving rick,Rick,0,0.06666666666666667,3.804443499990157,0.001332115536208548,0.00039113654991022683,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who made the movie fifty shades of grey
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who made the movie ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" The user provided some context about the film's release and its success. Let me go through this step by step.  First looking at the context given it mentions that the film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2015 and was released on February 13th of the same year by Universal Pictures and Focus Features. It also talks about box office success despite negative reviews.  But wait the question is specifically asking who made the movie. So I need to find out the director(s) and maybe the writers involved. From what I recall ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson. He's known for other movies like ""The Devil Wears Prada."" The script was written by Eliza Doolittle who is also known for her work on ""The Devil Wears Prada "" but she wrote the screenplay for this movie as well.  Additionally I think the main actress played by50 Cent whose real name is Curtis Jackson also contributed to the making of the film. She acted in it and perhaps had a role that led to some controversy or discussions about her participation due to her real-life actions but she's still credited for being part of the cast.  So putting this together the movie was produced by Focus Features along with Universal Pictures. The creative team includes director Sam Taylor-Johnson screenwriter Eliza Doolittle and actress 50 Cent/ Curtis Jackson.  ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson written by Eliza Doolittle and starred in the film as 50 Cent (Curtis Jackson).

Question: what are the names of the hunger games
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the names of the Hunger Games based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions several films related to The Hunger Games franchise. It starts by saying that the first three films set box office records. Then it details specific records for each year:  - The Hunger Games (2012) set records for opening day and the biggest opening weekend for a non-sequel film. - The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) set the record for the biggest opening weekend in November. - The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014) had the largest opening day and weekend of 2014.  It also mentions that the films including The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 (2015) received positive criticism for themes messages Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal etc.  So putting this together the films are: 1. The Hunger Games 2. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire 3. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 4. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2  I should list these names as per the context given.  The Hunger Games consists of the following films:  1. The Hunger Games  2. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire  3. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1  4. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2,4 hunger games mockingjay – part 2,The Hunger Games,0,0.4444444444444445,2.6516428000031738,0.0009158741353563942,0.00026891950414069,0.0,0.0,0.0

First the context mentions that the movie was originally set up at Touchstone Pictures with Ben Affleck as the lead but he didn't play it.

But then I see another mention of Jennifer Garner and Christa Allen appearing together for the first time since 13 Going on 30 in 2004 but I don't think that directly relates to filming locations.

Question: who had created the second bank of the united states
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who created the second bank of the United States based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context again carefully.  The context given is about a building being designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1987 for its architectural and historic significance. Hmm that's all. It doesn't mention anything directly related to U.S. banks or their creation.   Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking specifically about the second bank of the United States. From what I remember the U.S. has had several banks throughout its history. The first was created in 1791 by Alexander Hamilton as part of the Federal Bank. Then there's also the Second Bank of the United States.  But according to the context provided which talks about a building designated as a National Historic Landmark related to architecture and history it doesn't specify anything about banks. So perhaps this is a red herring or maybe the question was intended differently. Alternatively maybe the answer isn't directly in the context because the context doesn't mention banks at all.  Wait but I think the Second Bank of the United States was created by Alexander Hamilton as well right? Because that's how it goes with the Federal Banks. So perhaps the answer is also Alexander Hamilton. But since the context doesn't mention banks maybe I should stick to what's given or make an assumption based on general knowledge.  Since the user provided a specific context about a building which isn't related to the bank but if we have to use that context then the answer might be none of them because it doesn't provide information about banks. However without more context I can only assume based on known facts.  The Second Bank of the United States was created by Alexander Hamilton.

Context: Luther made an attempt to remove the books of Hebrews , James , Jude and Revelation from the canon ( notably , he perceived them to go against his new doctrines such as sola gratia and sola fide ) , but this was not generally accepted among his followers .

Question: when were 7 books removed from the bible
Answer: ","Okay so I have to figure out when seven books were removed from the Bible based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that Luther attempted to remove certain books from the canon—specifically Hebrews James Jude and Revelation. That's four books right there. But the question mentions seven books so maybe I'm missing something else here.  Wait the first part of the context mentions that he made an attempt to remove those four books because they went against his new doctrines like sola gratia and sola fide. However these four aren't the only ones removed according to the question. The context also notes that even though these weren't generally accepted by his followers these four are ordered last in the German-language Luther Bible today.  Hmm perhaps I'm misunderstanding which books were removed. Let me think about other books associated with Luther's changes. Oh! I recall that Luther translated and included additional books into the Bible beyond the traditional 95 books he recognized. Wait but in this case he removed some as well.  Wait the context says he attempted to remove four books (Hebrews James Jude Revelation). But when asked about seven books being removed from the Bible maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps the user is referring to the German Bible edited by Luther where these four are placed last but that doesn't necessarily mean they were all removed; they might just be ordered later.  Wait no the context says he ""made an attempt"" to remove them implying they weren't widely accepted. But if seven books are being referred to as removed maybe I need to consider other factors or perhaps the user is referring to another set of changes.  Alternatively perhaps the user meant that in total seven books were removed by Luther from the canon when he attempted this. The context says he tried removing four (Hebrews James Jude Revelation) but maybe there's an additional three? Or perhaps it's a mistake and they're asking about when these attempts happened.  Wait let me parse the sentence again: ""Luther made an attempt to remove the books of Hebrews  James  Jude and Revelation from the canon ( notably  he perceived them to go against his new doctrines such as sola gratia and sola fide )  but this was not generally accepted among his followers . However  these books are ordered last in the German - language Luther Bible to this day.""  So it's only four books being discussed here. So perhaps the user is mistaken about seven or maybe I'm missing something else.  Alternatively maybe the question refers to when seven books were removed from any Bible not specifically by Luther. But that seems off because the context is specific to Luther's actions.  Wait another angle: perhaps the user is confused and refers to the four books being moved but considering others as well? Or perhaps it's a mistranslation or misunderstanding of how many were actually removed.  Alternatively maybe the user is referring to when these attempts to remove books happened. Since the context doesn't provide a specific date I can only infer that it was during Luther's time which was in the early 1500s—specifically from 1521 onwards as he began translating and reforming.  Wait but the user is asking when seven books were removed. The context mentions four. Maybe the user thinks all traditional books are removed except these four? No that doesn't make sense because there are more than four traditional books in the Bible today besides those four.  I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to think step by step.  1. The question is when were seven books removed from the Bible. 2. From the context: Luther attempted to remove four specific books (Hebrews James Jude Revelation) from the canon. 3. These attempts were not widely accepted and these four are now placed last in the German-language Luther Bible.  So according to the context provided only four books were removed by Luther. There's no mention of seven being removed elsewhere or by another person. Therefore perhaps the user is mistaken about it being seven but based on the context given only four are discussed.  Alternatively maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps ""seven"" refers to something else like other books that were added? But the question specifically mentions removals.  Wait let me check if there's another set of books associated with Luther's changes. Oh! I remember that in addition to removing some books Luther included others. For example he added certain books like Philemon and perhaps others beyond the traditional 95. But again this is about additions not removals.  Wait no—the context specifically says ""attempted to remove "" so it's only those four.  So maybe the user is mistaken in their question regarding seven books but based on the given context the answer should focus on when these four were removed.  But wait the user asked for the time when seven books were removed. Since the context doesn't mention seven perhaps I need to state that there's a misunderstanding and that only four were involved here.  Alternatively maybe the question is referring to the fact that in addition to those four other books were also considered for removal but not accepted by followers so totaling more than four. But without explicit information from the context it's hard to say.  Given all this confusion perhaps I should conclude that based on the provided context only four books (Hebrews James Jude Revelation) were attempted to be removed by Luther and they are now placed last in his German Bible. Therefore answering when seven books were removed isn't supported by the given text—only four.  But wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The user's question is asking for the time period when seven books were removed from the Bible based on the context provided. Since the context only mentions four perhaps they are mistaken or referring to another scenario.  Alternatively if considering that in some contexts certain books like 1 Esdras and others might have been added by Luther beyond just removing four but again not sure.  In any case given the information I have from the context the answer should be when the attempt was made during Luther's time to remove those four books. So the time frame would be around when Luther was translating the Bible in the early 1500s specifically after his translation of Genesis and before his death in 1534.  Wait but the user is asking about seven books being removed. Since only four are mentioned perhaps they meant to ask about four instead of seven. Alternatively I need to respond based on what's given without assuming more than that.  I think the safest answer is to point out that according to the context provided only four books were attempted to be removed (Hebrews James Jude Revelation) by Luther in his German Bible and these are now placed last. Therefore it's not seven books but four.  According to the context provided Luther attempted to remove four books from the Bible: Hebrews James Jude and Revelation. These were ordered last in his German-language Bible. There is no mention of seven books being removed.  Answer: The attempt was made by Luther around 1521–1534 when he translated and reorganized parts of the Bible placing these four books at the end.", attempt was made by luther around 1521–1534 when he translated and reorganized parts of bible placing these four books at end,1546,0,0.0,11.84334829999716,0.004192664565626238,0.0012310526441252862,0.0,0.0,0.0

It mentions that at a reunion in Chicago the alumna Cecil Lockhart kidnapped Ben renamed him Sam and raised him as her own child until she was committed to a mental hospital. So the kidnapping of Ben is tied to Cecil Lockhart. She did it to escape from her marriage or something else. After being away she had Sam raised with the Cappadders by his adoptive father George Karras.  Wait so the question is asking who kidnapped Ben in the deep end of the ocean? Hmm that part confuses me a bit because I don't recall the context mentioning an ocean. The story takes place in a town called Deep End which has a beach but maybe it's just a location name and not directly related to the kidnapping.

Question: who wrote hit me baby one more time
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who wrote ""Hit Me Baby One More Time."" Wait in the context provided earlier it's stated that ""Baby One More Time"" was written by Max Martin. But now the question is about ""Hit Me Baby One More Time "" which seems like a different song or perhaps a misprint.  Looking at the context again: ""Baby One More Time"" is Britney Spears' debut single from 1998 co-produced by Max Martin and Rami. So that's one song. The question mentions another song with a similar title but slightly altered.   I should check if there are any other songs by Britney Spears with the same name or a variation of it. I recall that she did have ""Baby One More Time"" as her debut single which was released in 1998 and was a big hit at the time. The song you're referring to now might be another version or perhaps a cover.  Alternatively maybe there's a mix-up between ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" and ""Baby One More Time."" Since I don't have information on that specific song in the context provided it's likely not covered here. Therefore based solely on the given context I can only confirm that Max Martin wrote ""Baby One More Time "" which was Britney Spears' single.  Since there's no mention of a song titled exactly ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" within the provided context I might have to assume it's either a different song or perhaps an error. However given that the question is directly asking about this song and assuming it exists maybe it's another collaboration by Max Martin but without more info I can't confirm.  Wait no—Britney Spears' only single under Jive was ""Baby One More Time"" as per the context. So perhaps there isn't a ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" song mentioned here. Therefore the answer based on available data is that Max Martin wrote ""Baby One More Time "" but if the question is about ""Hit Me Baby One More Time "" then either it's another song or not covered in this context.  However since I'm supposed to provide an answer without reasoning beyond the given context and considering that the provided context doesn't mention a song named ""Hit Me Baby One More Time "" perhaps the intended answer was Max Martin for ""Baby One More Time"" but with some variation. But strictly based on what's given there's no info on ""Hit Me..."" so maybe it's not covered here.  But wait in reality I know that Britney Spears did write a song called ""Hit Me Baby "" which is different from the one mentioned here. So perhaps this question is mixing up songs. Since the context doesn't cover ""Hit Me Baby One More Time "" and only refers to ""Baby One More Time"" being her single maybe the answer isn't found in the given data.  But since the user is asking for who wrote it and based on the context provided Max Martin wrote ""Baby One More Time."" However without info on ""Hit Me... "" I can't say definitively. So perhaps the answer is that Max Martin wrote ""Baby One More Time "" but if that's not what they meant there might be a mistake.  Max Martin wrote ""Baby One More Time "" Britney Spears' 1998 single which was released under Jive Records.

Question: who plays the coach in old spice commercial
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who plays the coach in the Old Spice commercial mentioned in the context about The Gears of War 3. Let me break this down.  First the context given is from The Gears of War 3 game where a character refers to ""COG Gear."" It also mentions that someone played the coach for Old Spice referencing a commercial. I'm not familiar with all the details about the Old Spice commercials and their main actors but perhaps there's some connection here.  Wait maybe this is a crossover reference or a joke within the game's lore. The Gears of War series often has references to other pop culture icons through their characters' names or voice actors. So if someone in the game mentions playing the coach for Old Spice it might not be directly about the commercial but perhaps part of a story or quest.  But without specific context from the game I'll have to think about famous Old Spice commercials and who stars in them.

Question: what type of boundary was the mexico earthquake
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what type of boundary the 1971 Mexico earthquake was. From the context given there's a crumbled sidewalk near a Hilton hotel in Mexico City. Hmm that sounds like an earthquake caused damage maybe indicating fault lines.  I remember that earthquakes are related to tectonic plate boundaries. There are three main types: convergent divergent and transform. Convergent is when two plates collide which can cause earthquakes along the boundary. Divergent is where plates move apart often leading to volcanic activity or in this case maybe significant ground movement. Transform occurs when plates slide past each other horizontally.  The context mentions an earthquake near Mexico City which was a major city historically. I think Mexico City is located at a convergent boundary because I've heard that the segment of the North American Plate is moving northwest relative to the Eurasian Plate. This kind of convergence can cause significant shaking and structural damage as seen in the Hilton hotel's sidewalk.

Question: when was the us department of homeland security created
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the United States Department of Homeland Security was created. The context given is that it was formed on November 25 2002. But wait the question asks for when it was created not just when it was established. I know that sometimes government agencies have different phases—like a planning phase and then an actual creation.  I remember hearing about September 11 2001 because that's when a lot of major government changes happened in the U.S. After 9/11 there were a series of acts aimed at improving security. One of them was the Intelligence Authorization Act of 2002. I think that act created several agencies related to homeland security.  So if September 11 is when things started to change and then in 2002 they passed the Intelligence Authorization Act which probably included creating DHS. But wait the context says it was formed on November 25 2002. Maybe that's when they officially created it as a separate agency.  But I'm a bit confused because sometimes agencies are established through laws and then officially created later. So did they create it in 2002 or earlier? The context directly says November 25 2002 so maybe that's the answer. But just to be sure I think the actual creation as a separate department happened on September 11 but then formally established on December 13 2002 which is close to November 25.  Wait no the context says it was formed on November 25 so maybe that's the date they made it an official department. So the answer would be November 25 2002.

Question: first day collection of mission china assamese film
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the first day collection of Mission China (Assamese) based on the given context. The context provided is ""Total length : 34 : 61"". Hmm that's a bit confusing. It might be a ratio or some other metric related to the film.   Let me break it down. The phrase ""Mission China"" could refer to a film maybe a Hindi movie since that's common in such contexts. The term ""Assamese"" probably means it's subtitled for Assamese audiences which is standard in many Indian films.  The context mentions ""Total length : 34 : 61"". I'm not exactly sure what the colons represent here. Could they be showing two different numbers or a ratio? If it's a ratio of something like opening weekend versus total runtime maybe 34 and 61 are those numbers. Or perhaps it's showing some other data points.  Wait considering the user's query is about the first day collection which is a specific amount of money earned on the film's release day. The context doesn't directly mention anything about revenue or box office figures. It only talks about length and possibly another metric.  Maybe ""Total length"" refers to 34 hours and 61 minutes? That seems plausible as some movies have long runtimes especially in regional languages which might require more time for subtitles. But how does that relate to the first day collection?  Alternatively could it be that the total length is broken down into two parts: 34 and 61? For example maybe 34 refers to the opening day's duration or something else entirely.  I'm a bit stuck here because without more context about what ""Total length : 34 : 61"" represents—like whether it's opening weekend total runtime audience reception metrics etc.—it's hard to pinpoint exactly. If I have to make an educated guess based on the information given perhaps the first day collection is referring to one of these numbers.  Since ""Total length"" might be a miscommunication or abbreviation for something else maybe it's part of a ratio related to revenue. For example if 34 represents the opening day and 61 another figure but I don't know which is which.  Wait in many cases the first day collection could be compared against other metrics like total releases or audience size. But without specific numbers it's hard to say.  Alternatively maybe ""Total length"" refers to the movie being 34 hours and 61 minutes long but that doesn't directly help with the first day's box office figures.  Perhaps the colon is separating two different time periods? Like total runtime is split into pre-release and post-release or something like that. But again how does that tie into the first day collection?  I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should consider if ""Mission China"" has any known data points about its first day collection from reliable sources. If I recall correctly some Indian films have specific opening weekends but I don't remember Mission China offhand.  Wait a second maybe ""Total length : 34 : 61"" is part of an equation where the first part (34) is the first day's length or revenue ratio to something else. Without more context it's impossible to know.  Given all this uncertainty perhaps I should respond that there isn't enough information provided to determine the first day collection based solely on the given ratio. Alternatively if ""Total length"" refers to a specific metric and 34 is the first day figure but without knowing what ""Total length"" includes or how it's measured I can't be precise.  In conclusion unless there's additional context clarifying what ""Total length : 34 : 61"" represents—like if it's total revenue split into parts or a specific ratio—the exact first day collection remains unknown.

Question: who are the co hosts on the real
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who the co-hosts were for the ""Real"" segment at the 2018 NAACP Image Awards. Let me start by recalling what I know about the NAACP Image Awards and their segments.  First off the NAACP Image Awards are a big deal in recognizing excellence across various categories like film television music etc. The 2018 ceremony took place on March 31 2018 hosted by Common and Taraji P. Henson. That's who I know for sure because they're well-known hosts at these events.  Now the ""Real"" segment is a part of the Outstanding Talk Series which focuses on inspiring conversations around important social issues. In previous years I believe this segment has featured some notable guests to provoke meaningful dialogue about topics like healthcare education gender equality etc.  For 2018 specifically I'm trying to remember or figure out who was there. I don't recall a specific list of co-hosts beyond the main hosts. Since it's an awards show usually only one host is mentioned alongside the main act but maybe this segment had its own team or guests.  I think in 2018 the ""Real"" conversation featured some guest speakers who were prominent in their fields. I'm trying to recall names likeLatifani Smith or possibly someone from a different background. Alternatively it might have been a collaboration with another organization or individual speaker.  Wait if I remember correctly the hosts for that year's ""Real"" segment included Common and Taraji P. Henson as the primary hosts but there were other guests involved to facilitate the conversation on important topics. However without specific memory of names it's hard to provide exact co-hosts beyond the main hosts.  I should probably check if there was a special guest co-host or a panel involved for that segment in 2018. But given my current knowledge cutoff is October 2023 I don't have access to real-time data beyond that. So based on what I know up until now the primary hosts were Common and Taraji P. Henson with possible additional guests contributing to the ""Real"" discussion.  To summarize without specific information about the co-hosts for the 2018 ""Real"" segment at NAACP Image Awards I can confidently state that the main hosts were Common and Taraji P. Henson but there may have been guest speakers involved as well.  The primary hosts for the ""Real"" segment at the 2018 NAACP Image Awards were Common and Taraji P. Henson.

Question: who gets the most punishments on impractical jokers
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who gets the most punishments on Impractical Jokers based on the data provided. Let me start by looking at the context given.  The context shows a table with four columns: Challenges Joe Murr Q and Sal. Each of these has three rows with numbers and percentages. The ""Challenges"" column lists different challenge names like 36 50 40 and 55 along with their respective percentages for each person.  Wait actually looking closer the first row under Challenges is ""Joe "" followed by percentages: 23.4% 35.9% 68.5% and 92.0%. So does this mean that Joe had 36 challenges attempted with 23.4% success? Or are these the number of times each person got punished?  Hmm I'm a bit confused now. The user mentioned ""punishments "" so maybe the numbers represent how many times each person was punished on each challenge. So for example Joe had 36 times being punished when he attempted 23.4%... Wait that doesn't make sense because percentages usually don't translate directly to counts like this.  Wait perhaps each row under Challenges corresponds to a different challenge number and the numbers are the counts of something else not the percentages. Let me re-examine the context:  The first line is ""Impractical Jokers statistics Joker Punishments Thumbs down Thumbs up Challenges."" So maybe each challenge has different stats: thumbs down thumbs up and punishments.  Looking at the table structure: - Challenges list: 36 50 40 55 - For each person (Joe Murr Q Sal) there are three columns with percentages. Maybe these are win rates or something else?  Wait perhaps each challenge has a certain number of attempts and outcomes. So for Challenge 1: Joe had 36 attempts where he got thumbs down 23.4% thumbs up 136 (which is much higher) and 254 (punishments?) but that seems off because percentages should sum to 100%.   Wait I think the numbers are counts for each outcome category and the percentages are their respective proportions out of the total attempts. So for Challenge 36 with Joe: - Thumbs down: 36 * 23.4% = around 8.4 - Thumbs up: 36 * 136%? That can't be right because percentages over 100% are impossible unless it's a typo.  Wait maybe the numbers after each person are the counts for each outcome. So for Challenge 36: - Joe has 23.4 thumbs down 136 thumbs up and 254 somewhere else (maybe penalties). But that still doesn't add up because percentages should total 100%.  I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Since the user is asking about who gets the most punishments on Impractical Jokers perhaps each person has a column for the number of times they were punished across all challenges.  Looking at the data:  - Joe: 377 (92.0%) Wait that can't be because percentages don't match counts unless it's per challenge. Maybe each row represents a different challenge attempt with their respective stats.  Alternatively perhaps the columns after Challenges are for each person's performance on that challenge. So for Challenge 36: - Joe had 36 attempts where he got thumbs down (23.4% success rate) thumbs up (136?) and 254? This still doesn't make sense.  I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's focus on the last part of each row which is probably the number of times each person was punished across all their attempts.  So for Joe: 377 Murr: 379 Q: 375 Sal: 377  Wait but in the data provided under Sal it's written as ""377 (92.0%)"" so maybe that's the number of times Sal was punished and his success rate.  So comparing all four: - Joe: 377 - Murr: 379 - Q: 375 - Sal: 377  But Murr has 379 which is higher than the others. So Murr gets the most punishments.

Context: The fight - or - flight response ( also called hyperarousal , or the acute stress response ) is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived harmful event , attack , or threat to survival . It was first described by Walter Bradford Cannon . His theory states that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system , preparing the animal for fighting or fleeing . More specifically , the adrenal medulla produces a hormonal cascade that results in the secretion of catecholamines , especially norepinephrine and epinephrine . The hormones estrogen , testosterone , and cortisol , as well as the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin , also affect how organisms react to stress .
Question: where is fight or flight in the brain
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the fight-or-flight response happens in the brain. From what I remember Walter Bradford Cannon talked about this. He mentioned that the hypothalamus is involved in preparing the body for either fighting or fleeing when there's a perceived threat.  Wait was it just part of the hypothalamus? Or is there more to it? Oh right the hypothalamus acts as a kind of ""alarm clock"" and triggers various responses. Then when the body needs to react quickly parts like the amygdala come into play because they deal with immediate reactions.  So putting that together the hypothalamus is where the initial alarm happens leading the brain to release stress hormones from the adrenal glands. The amygdala also plays a role in processing fear and triggering the fight-or-flight response by sending signals to other parts of the brain.  But wait does all of this happen in one place? Or are these different areas working together? I think it's more like a network within the brain rather than just one spot. But the primary location for initiating the stress response is the hypothalamus.

Since it's already provided as Scots origin with a specific author I can simply state that.  I should make sure not to add anything extra or explain unnecessarily since the user wants concise answers. So putting it all together the answer is where the phrase originated in Scotland and was used by William Hamilton.  The phrase ""dressed to the nines"" originates from Scotland and was used by Scottish poet William Hamilton in his 1719 work.

'' ( Roud 15472 ) is a children 's song that is often sung in schools , at camps and at birthday parties . The melody of this song is usually a shorter version of `` Turkey in the Straw '' , but it can also be sung to the `` Sailor 's Hornpipe '' . Various theories exist concerning the origin of the lyrics , but no conclusive evidence seems to exist . A common belief is that the lyrics refer to the ears of a hound dog . It is most likely that this was a crude wartime soldiers ' song that , in sanitized form , has made its way into other circles .
Question: meaning of song do your ears hang low
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out the meaning of ""Do Your Ears Hang Low"" based on the context provided. The context mentions it's a children's song sung in schools camps and birthday parties. It's a shorter version of another song but can also be sung to ""Sailor's Hornpipe."" There are theories about its origins involving hound dogs or wartime soldiers' crude songs that became sanitized.  So the meaning likely relates to something simple and lighthearted since it's for children. The action described in the lyrics is probably something playful maybe a gesture like fidgeting or looking around nervously. Given the context about ears hanging low perhaps the song has an image of someone's ears drooping which could symbolize being nervous or not paying attention.  I should also consider that the answer from before was ""It is a simple playful song often about a person fidgeting or looking around nervously."" That makes sense because it's meant for children and fits the description given. So I think that's the appropriate meaning.  The song ""Do Your Ears Hang Low"" is a simple playful children's tune that often depicts someone fidgeting or appearing nervous.", song do your ears hang low is simple playful childrens tune that often depicts someone fidgeting or appearing nervous,no conclusive evidence seems to exist,0,0.0,2.0775101000035647,0.0007127666604128133,0.00020928296748072493,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: The Wurtz reaction , named after Charles - Adolphe Wurtz , is a coupling reaction in organic chemistry , organometallic chemistry and recently inorganic main group polymers , whereby two alkyl halides are reacted with sodium metal in dry ether solution to form a higher alkane :
Question: why dry ether is used in woods reaction
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out why dry ether is used in the Wurtz reaction. Hmm from what I remember the Wurtz reaction involves reacting two alkyl halides with sodium metal in a solvent. The product is usually a higher alkane.  I think about solvents for reactions. Ether is often used as a solvent because it's a good at dissolving ionic compounds but doesn't react with them. Sodium metal could potentially react with protic solvents right? Protic solvents have hydrogen bonds and can donate protons which might interfere with the reaction.  Wait dry ether probably means that water isn't present. If there were moisture sodium could start a completely different reaction with water like hydrolysis or something else. So using dry conditions avoids that interference.  Also ether is a good solvent for dissolving alkyl halides because it's not polar enough to cause any issues but can still dissolve the ionic reactants well. It doesn't interfere with the sodium-metal reaction which requires aprotic conditions maybe?  So putting it all together dry ether prevents moisture from interfering and acts as a suitable solvent for the alkyl halides without reacting with them or the sodium.  Dry ether is used in the Wurtz reaction to prevent moisture interference avoiding hydrolysis of sodium metal while also serving as an appropriate solvent for the reactants.   Answer: Dry ether prevents moisture from interfering and acts as a suitable solvent for the alkyl halides without reacting with them or the sodium metal.,dry ether prevents moisture from interfering and acts as suitable solvent for alkyl halides without reacting with them or sodium metal,to form a higher alkane,0,0.0,2.6165336999983992,0.0009024782689867568,0.00026498620195145847,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: In 2017 , World Teachers ' Day commemorated the 20th anniversary of the 1997 UNESCO Recommendation concerning the Status of Higher - Education Teaching Personnel , bringing the sometimes - neglected area of teaching personnel at Higher Education institutions into the conversation about the status of teachers .
Question: who inaugurated 'world teachers' day'
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who inaugurated World Teacher's Day. The context provided mentions that in 2017 World Teacher's Day commemorated the 20th anniversary of the 1997 UNESCO Recommendation about higher education teaching personnel. It also says that this brought teaching staff at higher education institutions into discussions about teacher status.  Hmm so the key here is to identify who held the inaugural ceremony for World Teacher's Day in 2017. The context doesn't explicitly say who did it but since it mentions the 20th anniversary of the UNESCO Recommendation and its impact on discussing teaching personnel at higher education maybe the person in charge was UNESCO itself.  Wait UNESCO is an international organization so perhaps they held the ceremony as part of their activities. The context says that the recommendation from 1997 was about higher education teaching staff which ties back to bringing teacher status into discussions. Therefore it's possible that UNESCO maybe its Director-General or a specific official was the one who inaugurated World Teacher's Day in 2017.  I don't have explicit information here but based on the context given the most logical answer is that UNESCO specifically someone from there likely did it. So I'll go with that.

744,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: This mechanism is carried out without utilisation of metabolic energy . Here , only the roots act as an organ of absorption or passage . Hence , sometimes it is called water absorption ' through roots ' , rather ' by ' roots . It occurs in rapidly transpiring plants during the daytime , because of the opening of stomata and the atmospheric conditions . The force for absorption of water is created at the leaf end i.e. the transpiration pull . The main cause behind this transpiration pull , water is lifted up in the plant axis like a bucket of water is lifted by a person from a well . Transpiration pull is responsible for dragging water at the leaf end , the pull or force is transmitted down to the root through column of water in the xylem elements . The continuity of the water column remains intact due to the cohesion between the molecules and it act as a rope . Roots simply act as a passive organ of absorption . As transpiration proceeds , water absorption occurs simultaneously to compensate the water loss from the leaf end . Most volume of water entering plants is by means of passive absorption . Passive transport is no different from diffusion , it requires no input of energy : there is free movement of molecules from their higher concentration to their lower concentration . The water will enter the plant via the root cells that can be found in the roots where mainly passive absorption occurs . Also , with the absorption of water , minerals and nutrients are also absorbed .
Question: active absorption of water from the soil by the root is mainly affected by
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what affects the active absorption of water by the root. From the context provided it says that passive absorption occurs because roots don't use metabolic energy. They just absorb water without effort.  The question specifically asks about active absorption. Wait but in the context it mentions that this mechanism isn't using metabolic energy so maybe active absorption isn't happening here. Passive processes don't require energy; they're just moving molecules from high to low concentration.  So if passive absorption is what's occurring through the roots without metabolic energy then factors affecting active absorption probably aren't relevant here. Maybe active transport would require something like a carrier protein and energy which isn't mentioned in this context.  Therefore since passive absorption doesn't rely on energy or other factors besides diffusion there are no factors affecting active absorption because it's not taking place.  Active absorption of water by roots is influenced by the presence of root cells as they facilitate the uptake process. However according to the context provided passive absorption does not require metabolic energy and occurs through diffusion without any additional input.,active absorption of water by roots is influenced by presence of root cells as they facilitate uptake process however according to context provided passive absorption does not require metabolic energy and occurs through diffusion without any additional input,SURFACE AREA OF ROOTS,0,0.09523809523809525,2.0535930000041844,0.0007024639360133057,0.0002062578754622287,0.0,0.0,0.0

The context lists all the states and provinces of North America each presumably with some sort of average income data.  First I should think about which regions typically have higher incomes. Generally coastal areas tend to have higher salaries because they often involve more skilled labor or service jobs. So looking at the list California is a big state on the west coast and known for high tech industries like Silicon Valley. That might be a candidate.  Then there's Texas another large state with many industries including energy manufacturing and professional services. They have a lot of Fortune 100 companies which usually mean higher average incomes.   Colorado is in the western US as well but it's more on the borderline between high income states like California and others. It has some good-paying jobs due to natural resources and tech.  Looking at the context the highest average incomes are mentioned for California Texas and Colorado. These three seem to be the top contenders because each has a significant number of high-paying sectors or is known for its economy being very robust with higher salaries across various industries.

Wait so she plays Talisa Maegyr? But the question is asking about Lady Talisa specifically. Hmm maybe I'm mixing up her role with someone else. In Game of Thrones Talisa Maegyr is portrayed by a different actress right?  I remember that in the show there's a character named Talisa who has a significant presence but she might have multiple roles or perhaps different characters within the story. Maybe Oona Chaplin plays one version while someone else plays another.  Let me think—Oona Chaplin was in Game of Thrones as Talisa Maegyr which is a part of the show's timeline. However the original Lady Talisa from A Song of Ice and Fire might have been portrayed by someone else. I'm pretty sure it wasn't Oona but rather someone else like Sophie Marceau.

So it's not like a hinge or pivot joint where parts can rotate independently; they're moving as a unit.  I'm trying to recall if there are other types of joints between the malleus and incus. The hammer (malleus) anvil (incus) and stapes (styloid) all fit together in the middle ear. The malleus connects to the ossicles but I don't think they form a hinge or pivot joint because those usually allow rotation on one axis whereas here it's more of a sliding movement since all move as a unit.  So putting this together the Incucodomallar joint is the synovial joint between these two. It might not be as commonly referred to now but based on the context given that's the answer.  The Incucodomallar joint connects the incus with the malleus.

Question: who was mr.owen in and then there were none
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who Mr. Owen is in the story ""There Were None."" From what I remember ""There Were None"" is a pretty famous mystery novel by Agatha Christie. The story involves a detective named Mr. Challenger who solves various crimes throughout the book.  The question mentions that after Edward Seton's execution he talks about being ""Mr. Owen "" referring to a character named U.N. Owen on an island. I think this is from the classic play or movie adaptation of the novel where the detective has nicknames for each person he solves a case with.   So putting it together in the story Mr. Owen would be one of the people who was responsible for Seton's death but escaped justice. He meets Seton through an agent named Isaac Morris. Their relationship is complex because Mr. Owen has his own dark motives which contribute to the mystery.  Therefore the answer should be that Mr. Owen refers to U.N. Owen the man who was one of the murderers and played a role in the plot on the island.  Mr. Owen referred to U.N.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the last time a hurricane hit Massachusetts based on the given context. The context provided mentions ""Hurricane Bob 1991 12."" I'm not entirely sure what each part of that string means but I think it's related to a hurricane.  First let me break down ""Hurricane Bob 1991 12."" It looks like ""Hurricane Bob"" could be the name of the hurricane. The number 1991 likely refers to the year it occurred. Then there's another part: ""12."" Maybe that indicates a specific category or intensity level like being a Category 12 hurricane? Wait but I know hurricanes are usually categorized from 1 to 5 in the Saffir-Simpson scale so maybe ""12"" isn't right. Perhaps it's a typo or an older system?  Alternatively ""Hurricane Bob"" might be part of another naming convention. Sometimes hurricanes are named after things like rivers lakes or animals. If ""Bob"" is the name and 1991 is the year then I can consider that as the date when Hurricane Bob occurred.  I should verify if there was a hurricane in Massachusetts in 1991. From what I remember there were significant hurricanes in the late 20th century affecting New England. Hurricane Bob sounds familiar but I'm not certain about its impact or exact timeline. However given that the context provides ""Hurricane Bob 1991 "" it's likely the most recent hurricane mentioned here hit MA in 1991.

Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who is known as the father of the Indian Constitution. The context provided mentions several key figures related to Indian history including Ambedkar Gandhi and others.  First looking at the context given: it talks about Ambedkar being the first law minister in Independent India the principal architect of the Constitution and a founding father of the Republic of India. Additionally he's known as Baba Saheb and inspired social reforms against discrimination against Dalits while also advocating for women's rights and labor justice.  I remember from school that the Constitution was framed by a group called the drafting committee led by B.R. Ambedkar in 1949. So Ambedkar is credited with playing a crucial role in its creation making him a foundational figure along with others like Jawaharlal Nehru and others who contributed to the draft.  I also recall that Gandhi was an important leader but wasn't directly involved in drafting the Constitution; he was more focused on non-violent resistance. Similarly leaders like Patel played significant roles too. Therefore while all these individuals are important Ambedkar is specifically noted as the father of the Indian Constitution because of his leadership and key contributions during the drafting process.

Question: what is use case model in software engineering
Answer: ",Okay I need to figure out what a Use Case Model is based on the given context. The context mentions that most UML tools support both text-based and visual modeling of use cases.  So from what I remember UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. Use Cases are part of the behavioral modeling in UML which focuses on how things behave or interact with each other.  A Use Case Model would involve creating diagrams to represent these interactions. So it's about capturing different scenarios or actions within a system and showing how they relate to each other and to the main actors involved.  I think that involves defining various use cases which are distinct interactions between an actor (like a user) and the system. Each use case can have preconditions actions and postconditions detailing what needs to be true before it starts what happens during it and what results after it ends.  Visually this might involve starting with a main use case at the top then branching out into sub-use cases that handle different aspects or more detailed interactions. These can be represented using specific UML diagrams like the Use Case Diagram.  So putting it all together a Use Case Model is a way to structure and visualize these interaction scenarios within a software system.  A Use Case Model in software engineering is a structured representation of interaction scenarios between actors and a system. It uses UML (Unified Modeling Language) to depict use cases which are distinct interactions capturing how different actors interact with the system. This model typically includes preconditions actions and postconditions visualized through diagrams like Use Case Diagrams often starting from a main use case that branches into sub-use cases for detailed scenarios., use case model in software engineering is structured representation of interaction scenarios between actors and system it uses uml unified modeling language to depict use cases which are distinct interactions capturing how different actors interact with system this model typically includes preconditions actions and postconditions visualized through diagrams like use case diagrams often starting from main use case that branches into subuse cases for detailed scenarios,a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role (known in the Unified Modeling Language as an actor) and a system to achieve a goal,0,0.2696629213483146,2.7288539000001037,0.0009482237185639225,0.0002784180078536934,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what is the name of the shape with 100 sides
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the name of a shape that has 100 sides. Hmm let me start by recalling some polygon names I know. A triangle is 3 sides a quadrilateral is 4 pentagon is 5 and so on. There's also terms like hexagon (6) heptagon (7) octagon (8) nonagon (9) decagon (10).   I remember that beyond decagon the names start to get longer. For example an 11-sided polygon is called a hendecagon or undecagon. Then 12 is dodecagon. I think after that it's just adding ""-gon"" with the Greek prefix for the number of sides.  But wait where does it stop? Like what's the name for a shape with say 20 sides? I'm pretty sure it's called an icosagon because ""icosa-"" is the Greek word for 20. Similarly 30 would be triacontagon right?  So if that pattern continues then 100 sides should follow this numbering system. Let me think about how these names are structured. For numbers like 11 and beyond it's ""henadeca-"" or something similar for the first part. But when dealing with larger numbers especially multiples of ten it simplifies.  Wait I see in the context provided that up to decagon (10) then there's hendecagon (11) onwards. Then at 20 it's called an icosagon. So for 100 sides following the same pattern after 10 is decagon so 100 would be something like hectogon.  Looking back at the context list I see entries like ""hectogon"" under the 100 mark: ""hectogon hecatontagon hecatogon"". So that's the term used for a 100-sided polygon. The other terms like hecatontagon and hecatogon are also listed but hectogon is commonly used.  So putting it all together a shape with 100 sides is called a hectogon.  A shape with 100 sides is called a hectogon.  Answer: hectogon",hectogon,hectogon,1,1.0,4.332822800002759,0.0015314407929348886,0.0004496625494251109,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what is the minimum size of a udp datagram
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the minimum size of a UDP datagram based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions a field that specifies the length in bytes of the UDP header and UDP data. It says the minimum length is 8 bytes because that's the header itself. Then there's a discussion about the maximum sizes but I'm not as concerned with those for this question since it's asking about the minimum.  I should focus on where it says ""The minimum length is 8 bytes because that is the length of the UDP header."" That seems straightforward. So the minimum size refers to just the header without adding any data beyond that.  Wait but sometimes datagrams can be empty or have minimal data? I think in networking a datagram needs some form of header even if there's no data after it. So maybe 8 bytes is correct for both an empty datagram and when including some data.  I should make sure I'm not missing anything else. The context also talks about maximums being limited by IPv4 but that doesn't affect the minimum size here. So yes 8 bytes seems to be the answer.

Question: what happens to vanessa at the end of gossip girl
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what happens to Vanessa at the end of Gossip Girl. Let me start by recalling the show's plot. Gossip Girl is set in a boarding school and revolves around the lives of its students and staff.  Vanessa is one of the main characters right? She's pretty prominent because she has a crush on her brother's best friend Alex. There are some conflicts involving other girls like Blair Serena and others. The show has a lot of drama with secrets and betrayals.  I remember that there was a spin-off movie called The Carrie Diaries mentioned in the context. The producers liked to imagine Vanessa directing episodes of it. So maybe her storyline is connected to that show or something else after Gossip Girl ended.  After watching all the seasons I think Vanessa didn't have a major arc like some other characters. She had some breakups and hinted at possible relationships but nothing conclusive. Since the spin-off involved her being an agent for Carrie perhaps she gets involved with her again in that storyline? But how does that tie into what happens at the end of Gossip Girl?  Wait maybe the question is asking specifically about Vanessa's fate after Gossip Girl concluded. If there was a movie or prequel mentioned where she directed episodes of The Carrie Diaries it might imply that her role in the show influenced her post-Gossip Girl life.  I think after Gossip Girl ended Vanessa went on to do other projects maybe acting in movies or continued with her writing career. But I'm not sure if there's a specific ending detail about her. Alternatively perhaps she's portrayed as being part of the agent group for Carrie Diaries leading to some closure.  Wait another thought: sometimes spin-offs end with character arcs. If Vanessa directed episodes of Carrie Diaries maybe her involvement leads to her relationship with Carrie or another character from that show ending in a certain way.  But I'm not entirely sure about the exact details. Maybe she ends up with someone else after Gossip Girl but without more information it's hard to say definitively.  Vanessa is mentioned as being involved in the spin-off series *The Carrie Diaries* where she directs episodes of the show. This involvement might suggest a relationship or storyline continuation from her time in *Gossip Girl*. However no specific post-*Gossip Girl* ending details about her relationship with Carrie are provided.

Question: what is the main source of nutrients in an estuary
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the main source of nutrients in an estuary based on the given context about Rio de la Plata. Hmm let's start by recalling what an estuary is. An estuary is where a river meets a body of water usually a sea or ocean. These areas can have unique ecological conditions because they receive fresh water from rivers and saltwater from the surrounding ocean.  Now the question is about nutrients in such an environment. I remember that nutrient-rich water comes into play here. Freshwater from rivers often contains dissolved oxygen and some nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus but it's not as salty as saltwater. When the river meets the sea there's a mixing process where these two waters combine.  I think about what happens when fresh and saltwater mix. The denser freshwater tends to flow horizontally while the less dense saltwater moves vertically towards the bottom. This exchange can bring nutrients from the deeper parts of the ocean into the estuary. So the main source would be the ocean itself providing dissolved nutrients that get carried into the river.  I should consider if there's anything else contributing significantly. Maybe tides or biological processes? But in terms of primary nutrient sources it's probably the ocean's nutrient-rich water that's dominant because it's continuously supplied and mixed with the river flow.  The main source of nutrients in an estuary is the ocean which provides dissolved nutrients through mixing with fresh water from rivers., main source of nutrients in estuary is ocean which provides dissolved nutrients through mixing with fresh water from rivers,The mixing of sea water and fresh water,0,0.3076923076923077,2.5288101000041934,0.0008722250822194429,0.0002561032433984517,0.0,0.0,0.0

It also states that it is ranked as number 59th and has a prominence of 3 329 meters. There are coordinates given for its location but those don't help with the date.  I remember seeing somewhere that Etna is one of the most active volcanoes in the world. The context says it was last eruptive on March 16 2017. So putting that together I think that's the answer they're looking for.  The last eruption of Mount Etna occurred on **March 16 2017**., last eruption of mount etna occurred on march 16 2017,16 March 2017,0,0.4615384615384615,1.6572870000090916,0.000557124053830701,0.00016358309348118354,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who played the elephant man in the film
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who played the Elephant Man in the film mentioned. Let me look at the context provided step by step.  First I see that Bruce Foxton was inspired by the film and wrote a song called ""Freak "" which mentions a reference to it. That's probably ""The Elephant Man"" since it's a famous film with an elephant man character.  Then the answer should be the actor who played John Hurt in The Elephant Man because the context mentions that Cooper Pilkington and others have cited it as their favorite movie leading them to create content around it. So I think the main actor is Robert Pattinson since he's known for playing the role of John Hurt in the film.

Context: First Nations ( French : Premières Nations ) are the predominant Indigenous peoples in Canada south of the Arctic . Those in the Arctic area are distinct and known as Inuit . The Métis , another distinct ethnicity , developed after European contact and relations primarily between First Nations people and Europeans . There are currently 634 recognized First Nations governments or bands spread across Canada , roughly half of which are in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia .
Question: where are the first nations located in canada
Answer: ",Okay so I need to answer where the First Nations are located in Canada based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that First Nations (or Premières Nations) are the predominant Indigenous peoples in Canada south of the Arctic. That gives a clear geographical location: southern parts of Canada relative to the Arctic which I think is in northern Canada. Then it says that those in the Arctic area are distinct and known as Inuit. So the Inuit would be located around the Arctic region.  Next there's mention of the Métis ethnicity who developed after European contact primarily between First Nations people and Europeans. This ties into how different Indigenous groups have settled across Canada but seems to emphasize that First Nations are specifically in southern parts relative to the Arctic which is probably most of Canada except for the northern regions where Inuit are found.  The context also states that there are currently 634 recognized First Nations governments or bands spread across Canada. It notes that roughly half of these are in Ontario and British Columbia. So the majority are in southern parts like these provinces.  Putting this together: First Nations are primarily located in southern Canada excluding the northern regions where Inuit live. Specifically most are found in Ontario and British Columbia.  The First Nations are primarily located in southern Canada with a significant presence in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia while those in the Arctic region are known as Inuit.

Context: Robinson is an English language patronymic surname , originating in England . It means `` son of Robin ( a diminutive of Robert ) '' . There are similar surname spellings such as Robison and Robeson . Robinson is the 15th most common surname in the United Kingdom . According to the 1990 United States Census , Robinson was the twentieth most frequently encountered surname among those reported , accounting for 0.23 % of the population .
Question: what is the origin of the name robinson
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out where the name Robinson comes from. From the context provided it's an English language patronymic surname. That means it likely comes from a family or place name.  The context mentions that ""Robinson"" means ""son of Robin "" and Robin is a diminutive form of Robert. So Robin as a given name probably has its roots in a place or family name related to Robert.  Since Robin is an older name with English origins it's possible that Robinson comes from the same background. Maybe it's derived from a place like ""Robsbern"" or similar where the last name would be ""Robinson."" Alternatively it could come from personal names meaning ""robust"" or something else related.  Given that there are similar spellings like Robison and Robeson I think Robinson is more common. The context also mentions it's the 15th most common surname in the UK so it's quite traditional.  Putting this together the origin of ""Robinson"" as a surname likely traces back to an older English place or family name that evolved into ""Robin "" which then became part of the surname. So Robinson is probably derived from such roots.  The surname Robinson is derived from the English patronymic root ""Robin "" which comes from the name Robert and the word meaning ""son.""", surname robinson is derived from english patronymic root robin which comes from name robert and word meaning son,English language patronymic surname,0,0.27272727272727276,2.3409493999934057,0.0008007550166270937,0.00023511816056005693,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when did taylor swift's first album release
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out when Taylor Swift's first album was released. Let me look through the context provided.  The context starts by saying that Taylor Swift's career began in 2005 with a record deal with Big Machine Records. The next sentence mentions that her debut album was released the following year. So if her career began in 2005 her first album would be from 2006.  I should make sure I'm not missing any details or misinterpreting the timeline here. It says ""the release of her eponymous debut album the following year "" which means right after 2005 so that's 2006.  So putting it together Taylor Swift's first album was released in 2006.

Question: when's the last time michigan won a national championship in basketball
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when Michigan last won a national championship in basketball. The context provided includes a table with some data from 1989. Let me look at that.  In the ""Year"" column it's 1989. The ""Coach"" is Steve Fisher and the opponent was Seton Hall. The score shows Michigan won by 79-80? Wait actually looking closer: ""Score"" says -- 79 (OT) Seattle 30--6. Hmm that might be a typo or unclear formatting. Let me parse this again.  The format seems to be Year Coach Opponent Score Site Overall Record Big Ten Record National Championships. So the score line is ""-- 79 ( OT ) Seattle 30--6"". Maybe that means Michigan scored 79 in overtime and lost by a smaller margin? Or perhaps it's indicating the final score was Michigan 79 Seton Hall 80 with an overtime game?  Wait I'm not sure. But the key point is that the ""National Championships"" column has an empty cell except for a line at the bottom saying National Championships. So does this mean Michigan won a national championship in 1989? Or did they win more than once but only have one entry here?  I think the table might be showing a single game where Michigan won which would imply their national championship was that year. Alternatively maybe the overall record includes multiple championships over several years.  But given the limited data and since in 1989 they had an Overall Record of 30-6 and a Big Ten Record of 12-6 with a national championship it's likely that their last national championship was in 1989.

Question: who sang buddy can you spare a dime
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who sang ""Buddy Can You Spare a Dime."" Alright first off that song is pretty famous. I think it's from the musical side of the road or something like that. Let me try to recall some details.  I remember that the song was popular in the 50s and 60s probably during World War II or just after. It has a timeless feel to it because of the lyrics about being tough and resilient. I think it's a classic rock song with that kinda slow tempo and maybe even a bit country vibe.  Now who sang it? I'm pretty sure it wasn't Johnny Cash at first. Wait no I think it was someone else. Maybe it's not as well-known as some other songs. Let me try to piece this together. The context mentions it's from the Great Depression scene in ""The American Adventure"" ride at Epcot. That ride is part of Disney's World Expo right? So maybe the song is a background or theme song for that.  I think I've heard it associated with a movie or a TV show as well. Maybe it's not just one artist but possibly a collaboration. Or perhaps it's from a specific album that was popular during a certain time period. I'm trying to remember if it's from the 50s or 60s like Johnny Cash might have been around then.  Wait no I think it's actually associated with the movie ""The Outlaw"" or maybe another Western film. Or perhaps it's from a live album where the artists were famous at the time. Maybe Jack Bruce? No that doesn't sound right either. I'm getting confused because there are so many rock songs out there.  Let me think about the structure of the song. It starts with ""Buddy can you spare a dime "" which is catchy and has that country feel to it. The chorus repeats the same line again after a few notes making it memorable. So maybe it's from a classic rock album or perhaps an older rock band.  I'm not entirely sure about the exact artist now but I think it might have been a collaboration between several artists or it could be a version by Johnny Cash that was popular in the 50s and early 60s. But wait when Johnny Cash released ""Buddy Can You Spare a Dime?"" around '72 is that correct? No I think that song is actually from an earlier era.  Maybe it's by The Everly Brothers or another group from the mid-50s. Or perhaps it was recorded by a solo artist like The Oak Ridge Boys. Let me try to recall if I've heard that name before in connection with this song.  Alternatively maybe it's not tied to any specific artist but is just a classic track that's been covered many times over the years. So without more context it might be hard to pin down the exact singer.  Wait perhaps checking some details about ""Buddy Can You Spare a Dime"" would help. The song was originally written by Sam Bush and Gene Autry in 1947 as part of their song ""A Horse named Silverado."" It became popular through radio versions especially in the post-World War II era.  So maybe it's not an original recording but more about its history rather than a specific singer. However that doesn't answer who sang it during the context provided.  Since I can't seem to recall the exact artist from this song associated with Epcot's ride perhaps it was recorded by someone like Johnny Cash for a live album or a movie soundtrack. Alternatively maybe it's more of a generic rock song without a specific solo artist behind it at that time.  I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the answer is just that the song isn't attributed to any single artist but is popular as is. Or perhaps it was covered by multiple artists over the years and one might have been prominent during the time of its popularity.  ""Buddy Can You Spare a Dime"" is associated with Sam Bush and Gene Autry's original work from 1947 and has been popularized through various renditions since then. Specific attributions to a single artist are not conclusively identified in historical context but it remains a timeless track.",buddy can you spare dime is associated with sam bush and gene autrys original work from 1947 and has been popularized through various renditions since then specific attributions to single artist are not conclusively identified in historical context but it remains timeless track,Bing Crosby,0,0.0,6.919285399999353,0.0024473274194861732,0.0007185857212378165,0.0,0.0,0.0

Possessing a high - powered offense which featured McNabb , Owens , and Brian Westbrook , as well as a bruising defense led by Pro Bowlers Trotter , Brian Dawkins , Lito Sheppard , and Michael Lewis , they steamrolled opponents on the way to a 13 -- 1 start to the season .

Question: when was the last time that the eagles were at the super bowl
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the Eagles were in the Super Bowl. Let me look through the context provided.  First the context talks about the Eagles having a great season with a 13-3 record. They steamrolled opponents and advanced to the playoffs winning their first Super Bowl. It mentions that after the final two games they played against the Patriots in the playoffs and lost by 24-21 ending their magical season one score short of the Super Bowl.  Wait but then it says this season was considered the franchise's most successful until their Super Bowl LII win in 2017. So that means the first Super Bowl they were in wasn't mentioned but there was a later one in 2017 when they won it all.

It's a sitcom that revolves around five friends in Pasadena. They're all really into science and have different professions.  Mrs. Wolowitz is one of them right? She's played by Amy S smart. Wait no that's not it. The voice might be someone else since she has a distinct style with the handlebar mustache and the ""Who"" as her last name. I remember she's an astrophysicist or something like that.  Looking back at other characters: Dr. Hofstadter is played by Jim Parsons who's a physicist turned writer. Dr. Arroway is Mayim Bialik a neuroscientist. Dr. Bernardo is Johnny Galecki a cosmologist. So Mrs. Wolowitz should be the fifth character which would make her played by Kelli portrayed as Amy Serrato.  Wait but sometimes in TV shows the voice actors might have different names. I think Amy Serrato's real name is used for her voice work. Also considering that she has a unique voice with a ""Who"" at the end it's likely that someone like Amy Serrato would have that style.

Question: when did australia 2 win the america's cup
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when Australia won the America's Cup based on Conner's statement. Let me read through the context again carefully.  Conner talks about losing the Cup in 1983 and how that was beneficial for sailing. He mentions that before the Australians won the Cup wasn't widely known outside yacht circles. But after they lost (which must have been a typo; he meant he lost) it made everyone appreciate it more. He also notes that without their effort after losing there wouldn't have been all those celebrations like parades and lunch with the President.  Wait Conner says they lost before the Australians won. So if Australia won after that loss when did they win? The context doesn't give the exact year but I know from general knowledge that Australia won in 2009 or 2010. Since the question is based on the provided context and Conner mentions the national effort happening because of their loss it's likely referring to the victory after his loss. Therefore the win must be mentioned as occurring in a specific year.  I think Australia won in 2009 with the S/41 yacht but I'm not entirely sure. However based on Conner's statement and the context given the answer should be 2009.  Australia won the America's Cup in 2009.,australia won americas cup in 2009,1983,0,0.0,2.492196999999578,0.0008611584574543537,0.00025285385450378575,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: The Jungle Book ( 1894 ) is a collection of stories by English author Rudyard Kipling . The stories are fables , using animals in an anthropomorphic manner to give moral lessons . A principal character is the boy or `` man - cub '' Mowgli , who is raised in the jungle by wolves . Other characters include Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear . The book has been adapted many times for film and other media .
Question: where did the jungle book story come from
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the Jungle Book story comes from. Let me start by recalling what I know about the book. It's a collection of stories written by Rudyard Kipling called ""The Jungle Book."" From the context provided earlier it mentions that it was published in 1894 and includes fables with animal characters to teach moral lessons.  Wait the question is asking where the story came from. I think this refers to the source material or authorship. The context says it's Kipling's work so the jungle book comes from his writing. But let me make sure. Are there any other possible sources? Maybe translations or adaptations but the primary origin would be the author.  So putting that together the Jungle Book is a fable by Rudyard Kipling. Therefore the answer should mention both the author and the publication year if needed. The context already states it's from 1894 so maybe just specifying the author suffices unless more detail is required.  The Jungle Book comes from the stories of English author Rudyard Kipling published in 1894.

Question: when does the black panther movie soundtrack come out
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the Black Panther soundtrack comes out based on the provided context. Let me go through the context again.  The context mentions that Ludwig Göransson was hired to compose the film's score by April 2017. He traveled to Senegal and South Africa to record local musicians for his soundtrack which is referred to as the ""base.""  Then it talks about Kendrick Lamar producing the film's curated soundtrack Black Panther: The Album along with Anthony Tiffith who is the founder of Top Dawg Entertainment. It says Coogler chose Lamar because his artistic themes align with those explored in the film.  Three singles from the album were released throughout January and February 2018: ""All the Stars "" ""King's Dead "" and ""Pray for Me."" The album itself Black Panther: The Album was released on February 9 2018. Additionally the soundtrack of Göransson's score was released on February 16 2018.  Wait a minute I'm a bit confused here because the album and the soundtrack might be different things. The album is Black Panther: The Album released in February 2018. Then there's also a soundtrack from the movie's score which includes some songs like ""All the Stars"" and others. But according to the context three singles were released for the album on January and February 2018 with the album coming out on February 9th. The soundtrack of the movie's score was released separately on February 16th.  So the question is asking when the Black Panther movie soundtrack comes out. From the context it says that the soundtrack from Göransson's score was released on February 16 2018. Therefore the answer should be that it came out on February 16 2018.

Looking at the context it mentions that a British commander named W. Elmes captured the United States Frigate Chesapeake. The date was June 1 1813 and the location was off Boston Massachusetts. The result was British victory so the British took the frigate.  The key points here are: - The U.S. ship is a ""gun frigate."" - It's named Chesapeake. - The capturer was W. Elmes part of the British forces. - The battle happened in June 1813 near Boston Harbor.  So putting it together the U.S. frigate captured by the British off Massachusetts is the USS Chesapeake.

So that must mean Hal Derwin provided his voice for Lee Bowman's performance of the song.  I remember that ""In My Dream Is Yours"" is a duet so both singers contributed to the track. Since Lee Bowman used Hal Derwin's voice it makes sense that Hal Derwin was one of the vocalists in that song. The other singer I think is Brenda Lee as she was often paired with Gary Mitchell and Lee Bowman in their music projects.  So putting it together the duet features Lee Bowman and Hal Derwin.

Context: There have been three presidents whose fathers were of German descent : Dwight D. Eisenhower ( original family name Eisenhauer and maternal side is also German / Swiss ) , Herbert Hoover ( original family name Huber ) , and Donald Trump ( whose paternal grandparents were Bavarian immigrants ) . Presidents with maternal German ancestry include Richard Milhous Nixon ( Nixon 's maternal ancestors were Germans who anglicized Melhausen to Milhous ) and Barack Obama , whose maternal family 's ancestry includes German immigrants from the South German town of Besigheim and from Bischwiller in the Alsace region that is nowadays part of France ; both families came to America around 1750 .
Question: where did german immigrants settled in the 1800s
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where German immigrants settled in the 1800s based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions several presidents with German descent and their backgrounds. It specifically talks about Richard Nixon's maternal grandparents being Germans who immigrated from Germany around the 18th century moving to South Carolina I think since that's where he was born. Barack Obama's maternal family has German roots from Besigheim in Alsace which is now part of France.  Wait but the question is about where they settled in the 1800s. So looking at the context again it says both families came to America around 1750. That might be their ancestors coming earlier but I'm not sure if that's relevant here because the question is about the 1800s.  The context also mentions Dwight Eisenhower and Herbert Hoover having German descent on one side each. Eisenhower's maternal side is German with a Swiss background while Hoover's original family name was Huber which might be German. But I don't see any specific information about where they settled in the 1800s from this part.  Wait the context only gives details about Nixon and Obama. So maybe the answer lies there. For Nixon his maternal grandparents came to America around 1750 but that's before the 1800s. Then Barack Obama's maternal family has German immigrants from Besigheim in Alsace-Lorraine which is now part of France. But where did they settle? The context doesn't specify a U.S. settlement for them.  Hmm perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the question asks specifically about the 1800s and the only mentions are from before that (like 1750) or no specific U.S. location maybe the answer is that there's not much information provided in the context about German immigrants settling in the U.S. during the 1800s.  Wait but I remember that many German immigrants to America came in waves around that time especially after the 18th century when the American Revolution happened. They settled mainly in New England and other areas like Philadelphia or Pittsburgh. But the context doesn't mention specific places for these particular cases of Nixon and Obama's families.  So perhaps the answer is that based on the given context there isn't enough information to specify where German immigrants settled in the 1800s except for knowing that they came from regions like Alsace-Lorraine (France) but not specifically where in the U.S.  Based on the provided context German immigrants settled in various parts of the United States during the 1800s. Specifically:  - Richard Nixon's maternal grandparents came to America around 1750 contributing to his family's German heritage. - Barack Obama's maternal ancestors have German roots from Alsace-Lorraine which is now part of France but their U.S. settlement details are not specified.  While many German immigrants in the 18th and 19th centuries settled in regions like New England and Philadelphia the context does not provide specific U.S. locations for these particular families' migrations during the 1800s.,while many german immigrants in 18th and 19th centuries settled in regions like new england and philadelphia context does not provide specific us locations for these particular families migrations during 1800s,"British colonies, settling primarily in Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia",0,0.14634146341463414,5.427195199998096,0.0019010343779451474,0.0005581828359772175,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: However , the cross symbol was already associated with Christians in the 2nd century , as is indicated in the anti-Christian arguments cited in the Octavius of Minucius Felix , chapters IX and XXIX , written at the end of that century or the beginning of the next , and by the fact that by the early 3rd century the cross had become so closely associated with Christ that Clement of Alexandria , who died between 211 and 216 , could without fear of ambiguity use the phrase τὸ κυριακὸν σημεῖον ( the Lord 's sign ) to mean the cross , when he repeated the idea , current as early as the apocryphal Epistle of Barnabas , that the number 318 ( in Greek numerals , ΤΙΗ ) in Genesis 14 : 14 was interpreted as a foreshadowing ( a `` type '' ) of the cross ( T , an upright with crossbar , standing for 300 ) and of Jesus ( ΙΗ , the first two letter of his name ΙΗΣΟΥΣ , standing for 18 ) , and his contemporary Tertullian could designate the body of Christian believers as crucis religiosi , i.e. `` devotees of the Cross '' . In his book De Corona , written in 204 , Tertullian tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross . The crucifix , a cross upon which an image of Christ is present , is not known to have been used until the 6th century AD .
Question: when did the crucifix become the symbol of christianity
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out when the crucifix became the symbol of Christianity based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that the cross symbol was already associated with Christians in the 2nd century CE. It references works by Octavius of Minucius Felix from chapters IX and XXIX which were likely around the end of the 2nd century or early 3rd century. It also talks about Clement of Alexandria using the term ""Lord's sign"" meaning the cross as early as between 211 and 216 CE.  Then it goes on to say that Tertullian in his book De Corona written in 204 CE mentioned how Christians traced the cross repeatedly on their foreheads. It also mentions that a crucifix which is a cross with Christ's image wasn't known until the 6th century AD.  So putting this together the context clearly states that by the early 3rd century the cross was closely associated with Christianity. However it specifically says that the crucifix as we know it became prominent in the 6th century. So I think the key point is when the crucifix itself became a symbol not just the cross.  Wait but does ""crucifix"" mean the same as ""cross""? Or is it referring to a specific type of cross? The context mentions that a crucifix with Christ's image wasn't used until the 6th century. So perhaps before that people might have had crosses without images or with different representations.  So the question is when did the crucifix become the symbol of Christianity.

Wait but that's different from ""Natasha Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 "" right? The show I'm asking about is probably another one because the one mentioned was from 2012.  Wait let me check again. The context given is about a musical that premiered in 2012 at Ars Nova directed by Rachel Chavkin. It's about a Russian supper club with various cast members including Natasha Pierre and others like Mimi Lien as set designer Bradley King for lights Paloma Young as costume Matt Hubbs as sound Dave Malloy as musical director and specific actors playing each role.  But that's not the ""Natasha Pierre..."" musical. That must be a different show or perhaps the same but with different information? Wait no maybe I'm confusing it. The original question is about the 1812 musical which was probably written by George Bal FOSS or someone else from 1812.  Wait let me think again. ""Natasha Pierre..."" is a play originally written in 1795 by Eugene Onegin. There have been stage productions over the years including some in the late 19th century like 1860s or so. But I'm not sure if there was one specifically in 1812.  Alternatively maybe ""Natasha Pierre..."" refers to a musical adaptation? Or perhaps it's a different show altogether. Wait no the context given is about a 2012 musical which doesn't align with the question being asked about 1812.  Wait this might be confusing because there are multiple plays and shows named ""Natasha."" The one in the context seems to be from a different play that's adapted into a musical.

Question: when did holland become involved in world war 2
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the Netherlands became involved in World War II based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The first sentence says that the direct involvement began with the Netherlands being invaded by Nazi Germany on May 10 1940. Then it mentions that the Netherlands had declared neutrality when war broke out in September 1939 which is just a bit after the start of World War I. However Hitler ordered an invasion regardless and a day later on May 15 they surrendered.  So putting this together the Netherlands' entry into WWII was during the invasion led by Germany. The declaration of neutrality in September 1939 doesn't count because despite their neutrality they were invaded anyway by Hitler's orders. So the key event is the invasion on May 10 which would be when they became involved.  I think that's it. They declared neutrality a bit earlier but were still part of WWII once invaded.  The Netherlands became involved in World War II on May 10 1940 when they were directly invaded by Nazi Germany., netherlands became involved in world war ii on may 10 1940 when they were directly invaded by nazi germany,with its invasion by Nazi Germany on 10 May 1940,0,0.48275862068965514,2.15868710000359,0.0007349336051437414,0.00021579163887478677,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: time of the state of the nation address
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the State of the Nation Address happens based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that originally it was a communication between the president and Congress but now has expanded to include the people. It also talks about radio and television broadcasting the speech live preempting scheduled programming. Importantly it says that to reach the largest audience which is in the evening after 9 PM ET (which is UTC-5).   So putting this together the key detail is that the address is typically given after 9 PM ET in the evening. That's probably a standard time slot for such important speeches to maximize viewer or listener attendance.  I should make sure I'm not missing any other information. The context doesn't mention specific dates but focuses on timing. So the answer should be the evening specifically after 9 PM ET.

Question: where is dakar located on the world map
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where Dakar is located on a map using the given context. Let me start by looking at the coordinates provided in the context. The context lists two sets of coordinates but they seem to be repeating the same information.  First set: 14°41′34″N 17°26′48″W Second set converts this to decimal degrees: 14.69278° N and -17.44667° W  So that translates to approximately 14.69278 degrees north latitude and -17.44667 degrees west longitude.  I remember that the Prime Meridian is at 0° longitude so a negative value means it's west of Greenwich. So about 17.45 degrees west.  Latitude-wise 14.69278°N places it in the northern hemisphere but still relatively close to the equator since it's below 23°N.  Putting this together Dakar should be somewhere near the Gambia region of Africa specifically in Senegal province. It makes sense because Dakar is the capital there and a major port city.  Dakar the capital of Senegal is located at approximately 14.69278° N latitude and -17.44667° W longitude placing it in central Africa.,dakar capital of senegal is located at approximately 1469278° n latitude and 1744667° w longitude placing it in central africa,Senegal,0,0.09523809523809523,2.6053422999975737,0.0008943392754552968,0.00026259642586739775,0.0,0.0,0.0

The culmination of a lengthy political battle between Johnson , a lifelong Democrat and the Republican majority in Congress over how best to deal with the defeated Southern states following the conclusion of the American Civil War , the impeachment , and the subsequent trial ( and acquittal ) of Johnson were among the most dramatic events in the political life of the nation during the Reconstruction Era .

Question: who is the first president to be impeached
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who the first President to be impeached is based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that this was the first impeachment since the office was created in 1789. It talks about a political battle between James A. Johnson a lifelong Democrat and the Republican majority in Congress. The setting is after the Civil War dealing with the defeated Southern states. The impeachment trial and acquittal of Johnson were dramatic events during the Reconstruction Era.  The key point here is that it's the first impeachment since 1789. So I need to think about when President James A. Johnson was impeached. From what I remember he was Vice President under Andrew Jackson but later became President after Jackson died in 1845. He was removed from office in 1860 which led to the impeachment process.  Wait wait so the impeachment happened during his presidency? Yes because he was Vice President before becoming President. But the first impeachment would have been someone else since the office started in 1789. The first President was George Washington but he wasn't impeached. The next was John Adams then Jefferson Madison Monroe etc. all up to the Civil War.  I think Thomas Jefferson was the last Precedent before the Civil War started. After that Andrew Jackson became President in 1829. Then Martin Van Buren William Henry Harrison... but Harrison died shortly after. Then John Tyler took office I believe he served one month as President before dying of heart disease.  Wait so if the first impeachment happened when? The context says it was during Reconstruction Era which started around 1865 after the Civil War. So Johnson became President in 1860 resigning later that year to avoid the impeachment trial. So his removal led to the impeachment process in 1861.  But who was the first President impeachment? I think it was James A. Garfield. Wait no he died before being President. No wait. Wait actually the first President to be impeached would have been the one who became President after the Civil War started. So perhaps that's when Johnson became President in 1860.  But let me think again: The first impeachment since 1789 which was before the Civil War. After the Civil War ended in 1865 the next president would be Abraham Lincoln but he wasn't impeached because he died in office in 1865.  So the next in line after Lincoln's death was Andrew Johnson as Vice President? But he became President due to the Emancipation Parallelogram Act which I think was during the Civil War. So he took office in March 1865 but the impeachment happened later.  Wait no I'm getting confused. The context is about James A. Johnson's impeachment as President. So he was removed from office in 1860 to prevent the impeachment trial that began in January 1861. That trial resulted in his acquittal because the House couldn't muster a two-thirds majority.  So the first President impeachment since 1789 would be James A. Johnson as he was the one who faced impeachment and was acquitted after resigning from Vice Presidency to avoid the trial.  Wait but I thought Thomas Jefferson was impeached before? No that's not correct. The first President to face impeachment was John Adams in 1812 for tax collection without authority. But then later like Martin Van Buren was impeached as well.  But according to this context it refers to the impeachment of James A. Johnson as the first after 1789. So perhaps that's correct.

Question: number of films in lord of the rings
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out how many films are in The Lord of the Rings. From what I remember it's based on a book right? The book has three main parts or something like that. Peter Jackson directed all three films as well.  I think the first film is called ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" That makes sense because it introduces Frodo and his quest to destroy the ring. Then there's the second one which I believe is ""The Two Towers."" I'm not too sure about the title but I know that this one continues the story after the first film.  And then the third one must be ""The Return of the King."" That rings a bell because it features Gandalf and the final battle with Sauron. So putting it all together there are three films in total: 2001 2002 and 2003.  I don't think there's a fourth one or an additional movie based on the book. The series ends with that return journey so yeah I'm pretty confident it's three films.

Question: how long was dark side of the moon number 1
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out how long ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" stayed at number one on the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart. Let me start by recalling what's provided in the context.  From the context it says that ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" topped the Billboard chart for a week and remained in the chart for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988. Then there's some information about its re-entry after rules were changed in 2009 but I don't need that part because it's asking specifically about how long it was number one before.  So the key points are: initial run of 741 weeks and a week as the top LP. Since it topped for a week first that means the single peak was at the top for more than a week overall but specifically the duration when it was at number one is just one week initially?  Wait no wait. Let me read again: ""It topped the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart for a week and remained in the chart for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988."" So that means after the initial week as number one it stayed at number one for another 740 weeks? Or is ""toped"" meaning only once?  Hmm. The wording says ""topped... for a week and remained in the chart for 741 weeks"". That could be interpreted as topping (being at top) for a week then staying there for 741 weeks overall from 1973 to 1988. But that wouldn't make sense because if it was only number one once then it's not possible.  Wait no perhaps the album went to number one once and stayed there until some point but according to the context it says ""it topped... for a week"" meaning one week on top and then remained (meaning continued to be on the chart) for 741 weeks in total from start to finish.  Wait that doesn't add up because if it was number one for a week plus 740 more weeks after that making 741 weeks in total. So maybe the initial week is included in the 741? Or perhaps ""topped... for a week"" refers to being at number one once.  I think I need to clarify this from the context: ""It topped the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart for a week and remained in the chart for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988."" So ""topped... for a week"" means it was at number one that week and then after that it stayed on the chart (maybe not necessarily at number one) for another 740 weeks. But if it's about how long it was number one maybe just that initial week.  Wait no because when an album is ""topped"" the chart it means it reaches number one. So perhaps the duration when it was number one is a total of 741 weeks? That seems too long because I know the album was released in 1973 and came back in 2009.  Wait another approach: The context says ""The Dark Side of the Moon topped the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart for a week"" meaning it reached number one that week then remained on the chart (perhaps not necessarily at number one) for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988. So the total time it was on the chart is 741 weeks but how long was it specifically at number one? It seems only once.  But I think maybe ""topped... for a week"" means that's when it reached top and then remained in the chart (but perhaps not necessarily number one) for another 740 weeks. But if so then it was number one for just that initial week. Alternatively maybe the total duration from when it first went to number one until it left is 741 weeks.  Wait let's parse the sentence again: ""It topped the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart for a week and remained in the chart for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988."" So ""topped"" means reached number one that week then remained (in the chart) for another 740 weeks? Or was it on the chart continuously for 741 weeks with only a week at number one?  Wait no because 1973 to 1988 is about 15 years. Let me calculate: 1973 to 1988 is from January 1973 to December 1988? So that's 16 years (including both full years). Each year has 52 weeks so 16*52=832 weeks. But the duration mentioned is only 741 weeks.  Wait but maybe it was released in 1973 and came back in 2009 making a longer period? Wait no the context says ""from 1973 to 1988"" so perhaps that's when it remained on the chart. So from 1973 to 1988 is roughly 15 years (assuming starting in January 1973 and ending in December 1988). Let me calculate: 16 years? No wait from 1973 to 1988 inclusive would be 15 years.  Wait 1973 +15=1988. So that's 15*52 weeks = 780 weeks approximately. But the context says 741 weeks. Hmm perhaps the exact start and end dates are considered to make it exactly 741 weeks.  But going back: The question is asking how long ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" was number one. From the context it's stated that it topped the chart for a week (so reached number one that week) and remained on the chart (not necessarily at number one) for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988.  Wait no because if ""remained in the chart"" is 741 weeks then including the initial week when it was top so total duration on the chart is 741 weeks. But how many of those were at number one? Only that first week. So perhaps the album was number one for only one week.  But I'm confused because if it was a top seller maybe it stayed in the top ten longer. However according to the context provided it's specifically stated as ""topped... for a week and remained in the chart for 741 weeks.""  So putting that together: The album reached number one (top) once which took up one week of its total presence on the chart over 741 weeks. Therefore how long was it number one? It's just one week.  Wait but I'm not sure if ""topped... for a week"" refers to being at number one that week and then remained in the chart (not necessarily top) for another 740 weeks. So total duration as top would be only one week.  Alternatively maybe it was on the chart for 741 weeks with each week being an entry but how many times did it reach number one? The wording says ""topped... for a week"" meaning just once during that time period.  So to answer: ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" was number one for one week.  ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" was number one for 1 week.", dark side of moon was number one for 1 week,a week,0,0.18181818181818182,12.66034149999905,0.004482479806766353,0.0013161483662678124,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what is the white stork a symbol for in western culture
Answer: ",Alright so I need to figure out what the white stork symbolizes in Western culture based on the provided context. Let me start by going through the context again.  The context mentions several things about the stork. It talks about a Polish folk tale where God gave the stork white plumage and the Devil gave it black wings which implies that the stork has both good and evil traits. Then it goes on to explain various associations of storks in different cultures with handicapped babies or stillborn ones suggesting they're linked to negative aspects like drops during transit or revenge.  In Denmark storks are said to toss a nestling off their nest and then an egg each year which might symbolize fertile but problematic progeny. Also medieval England associates storks with adultery possibly due to their courtship rituals. Their posture involves preening making them look self-conceited.  So focusing on the white stork specifically in Poland it's associated with goodness (white plumage from God) while the black wings represent evil from the Devil. But when considering Western culture beyond that I don't see any direct mentions of the white stork symbolizing anything positive except its role as a bird with some cultural significance.  Wait but maybe I missed something. The question is about what it's a symbol for in Western culture. From the context I only see the Polish aspect where the white plumage represents good and black wings evil. In other contexts like Germany or Denmark storks are linked to negative things. So perhaps in Western culture generally the white stork isn't particularly celebrated as a positive symbol beyond its role from Poland.  Alternatively maybe it's more about the imagery of the stork itself—preening and self-conceit (self-reverence) since that trait is mentioned regardless of color. But then the question asks specifically for what it's a symbol for in Western culture so perhaps self-conceit isn't directly tied to its color.  Wait but looking again the only positive aspect linked to the stork is its white plumage representing goodness from God. So maybe in Western culture the white stork is associated with moral virtue or innocence? Or perhaps it's just a symbol of something else but I don't see any explicit mention beyond its dual traits.  Alternatively could there be another angle? Maybe in some cultures the white stork represents something like good luck or a positive omen because of its plumage. But I'm not certain.  Considering all that perhaps the primary association is with its dual nature: representing both good and evil traits as indicated by the Polish tale where it's given white plumage but also black wings from the Devil. So in Western culture the white stork might symbolize a mix of virtue and vices or something like moral complexity.  But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the context is suggesting. Let me think again. The question specifically asks for the symbolization in Western culture so focusing on the positive aspect mentioned: in Poland the white plumage represents God's gift—goodness. So maybe in Western contexts it's associated with moral virtue or innocence.  Wait but the stork itself isn't necessarily considered a positive bird in other cultures; often they're seen as negative for carrying babies who are sickly or because of their actions in relation to children. So perhaps in some Western cultures beyond Poland the white stork is not given much significance except its dual traits from Poland.  Hmm maybe I should stick with what's explicitly mentioned: that in Poland it's associated with good (white plumage) but elsewhere it's linked to negative things like handicapped babies or evil. So perhaps overall the white stork isn't a widely recognized symbol in Western culture beyond its specific context in Poland.  In Western culture the white stork is primarily associated with moral virtue and goodness as depicted in the Polish folk tale where its white plumage symbolizes divine gift (goodness) while its black wings represent the Devil's influence (evil). This duality highlights its complex nature. In other contexts within Western cultures like Germany or Denmark it may be linked to negative traits such as association with handicapped babies or moral issues. Thus generally in Western culture beyond Poland the white stork is not prominently symbolized except for these dual associations.,in western culture white stork is primarily associated with moral virtue and goodness as depicted in polish folk tale where its white plumage symbolizes divine gift goodness while its black wings represent devils influence evil this duality highlights its complex nature in other contexts within western cultures like germany or denmark it may be linked to negative traits such as association with handicapped babies or moral issues thus generally in western culture beyond poland white stork is not prominently symbolized except for these dual associations,bringing babies to new parents,0,0.044444444444444446,7.083659999989322,0.0024906601829817075,0.0007313091128288786,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: describe the three phases of the normal blood clotting process
Answer: ",Okay so I need to describe the three phases of the normal blood clotting process. Hmm let me think about what I know from my biology class. Blood clotting is a complex process that involves several steps right? I remember it starts with something called fibrinogen. Oh yeah when a blood vessel gets damaged like a cut or injury platelets are the first to respond.  Wait so the first phase must involve these platelets. They probably aggregate and start forming a plug at the site of the injury. But what happens next? I think there's this substance produced by the liver called fibrinogen. It somehow transforms into something else—I believe it becomes fibrin when activated by factors like tissue factor which is part of the blood. So maybe the second phase is the activation of these clotting factors that lead to the production of fibrin.  And then the final phase must be the hardening and solidification of the fibrin into a clot. This helps stop the bleeding by sealing off the damaged vessel. I'm not entirely sure about all the details but I think those are the three main phases: aggregation of platelets activation of clotting factors leading to fibrin formation and finally the fibrin clots forming.  Let me try to structure this in my mind. Phase one is the initiation at the site of injury with platelet adhesion. Then phase two involves the engagement of clotting factors (like Factor II or VII) that activate fibrinogen into a polymer called fibrin. Finally phase three is the solidification of the fibrin into a durable clot to stop bleeding.  I hope I got that right. Maybe there's more to each phase but these are the primary steps I remember from class.  The normal blood clotting process occurs in three phases:  1. **Phase 1: Initiation**    At the site of injury platelets adhere to the damaged vessel and begin aggregating into a plug.  2. **Phase 2: Fibrin Formation**    Activated clotting factors (e.g. Factor II or VII) convert fibrinogen into fibrin polymer forming a mesh-like network at the injury site.  3. **Phase 3: Solidification**    The fibrin mesh solidifies and hardens sealing the bleeding site to prevent excessive bleeding., fibrin mesh solidifies and hardens sealing bleeding site to prevent excessive bleeding,"vasoconstriction,",0,0.0,3.9278228000039235,0.0013673833120058782,0.0004014918950536645,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who played sonny in lemony snicket's a series of unfortunate events
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who played Sunny Baudelaire in Lemoney Snicket's ""A Series of Unfortunate Events."" From the context provided I see that K. Todd Freeman is listed as playing Klaus Baudelaire the middle child interested in literature and books. But I'm looking for Sunny Baudelaire which is the infant with unnaturally strong teeth.  Looking through the list again: Neil Patrick Harris is Count Olaf Patrick Warburton is Lemony Snicket (the narrator) Malina Weissman plays Violet Baudelaire Louis Hynes as Klaus K. Todd Freeman as Arthur Poe Presley Smith as Sunny and Tara Strong voices Sunny's babbling with subtitles.  So it looks like Presley Smith played Sunny Baudelaire. That should be the answer.

Context: The UN General Assembly adopted the Convention and opened it for signature on 20 November 1989 ( the 30th anniversary of its Declaration of the Rights of the Child ) . It came into force on 2 September 1990 , after it was ratified by the required number of nations . Currently , 196 countries are party to it , including every member of the United Nations except the United States .
Question: when was united nations convention on the rights of the child created
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was created based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention and opened it for signature on 20 November 1989 which marks the 30th anniversary of its Declaration of the Rights of the Child. It then came into force on 2 September 1990 after ratification by the required number of nations. Currently 196 countries are parties to it including every UN member except the United States.  So from this information I need to pinpoint when the Convention was created. The key part is that it was adopted and opened for signature on November 20 1989. That's typically when a convention is officially established; the act of adoption and opening it for signature marks its creation or ratification process.  I should make sure I'm not confusing this with any earlier declarations or resolutions related to the child's rights but the context doesn't mention anything else before November 1989. Therefore the correct date must be November 20 1989.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was created on November 20 1989., united nations convention on rights of child was created on november 20 1989,20 November 1989,0,0.375,2.42673599999398,0.0008265038311943119,0.00024267854268934634,0.0,0.0,0.0

First I'll look for any rows that mention Hong Kong. Scanning through the table... Found a row labeled ""Hong Kong Stock Exchange"" with the symbol HKEX and the ID HKT.   Looking at the columns: the first column has various names like Open Close Lunch Open Lunch Close. So under the Open column it says 09 : 30. That means the market opens at 9:30 AM.   The other details are a bit confusing because in some rows certain times might be marked as ""No"" or have specific dates. But for HKEX it's straightforward with 09:30 AM opening time and closing at 16:00 (4 PM). So the market is open from morning to afternoon.

Question: what mlb teams did deion sanders play for
Answer: ",Okay I need to figure out which MLB teams Deion Sanders played for. Let me look through the context provided.  First his birthdate is August 9 1967 so he's turning 50 in a year or two. That should be recent enough that there might still be some relevant information here.  His position is listed as fielder and center fielder. The batting stats are .263 average with 558 hits 39 home runs and 186 stolen bases. Not super standout numbers but I don't think the stats matter for this question; it's about which teams he played for.  The context mentions his MLB debut was May 31 1989 with the New York Yankees and his last appearance was June 14 2001 with the Cincinnati Reds. So that gives me two teams: Yankees and Reds.  Then there's a timeline of teams:  - New York Yankees from 1989 to 1990 - Atlanta Braves from 1991 to 1994 - Cincinnati Reds from 1994 to 1995 - San Francisco Giants in 1995 - Cincinnati Reds again in 1997 and 2001  Wait that's interesting because he was with the Cincinnati Reds twice. So besides Yankees and Reds Atlanta Braves once and San Francisco Giants once.  Putting it all together Deion Sanders played for:  1. New York Yankees (1989-1990) 2. Atlanta Braves (1991-1994) 3. Cincinnati Reds (1994-1995 and 1997-2001) 4. San Francisco Giants (1995)  So that's four teams in total.

Question: how much money did the film titanic make
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out how much money the film Titanic made. Let me look at the context provided.  First the context mentions that including reissues from 2012 and 2017 Titanic earned $659.4 million in North America. It also earned $1.528 billion in other countries. So adding those two amounts together should give the total worldwide earnings.  Let me do the math: $659.4 million plus $1.528 billion.

Among the advantages of using steam versus a hot water spray are the facts that steam can operate at higher temperatures and it uses substantially less water per minute .
Question: at what temp does water turn to steam
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the temperature at which water turns into steam. Hmm from what I remember water boils at a certain temperature depending on the pressure. At standard atmospheric pressure which is around sea level water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. But wait sometimes it can be higher or lower based on altitude and pressure changes.  I think under normal conditions without changing the pressure it's 100°C. But if you increase the pressure like in a pressure cooker water boils at a higher temperature. Conversely lowering the pressure would mean a lower boiling point. So unless specified otherwise I should probably go with the standard boiling point of water which is 100 degrees Celsius.  Water turns to steam at its boiling point. Under standard atmospheric pressure this occurs at 100°C.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when ""It's a Wonderful Life"" comes on. From the context provided earlier about Clarence which mentions an episode starring Robert Carradine from 1991 but that's not directly related.  Wait I think ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a classic show. I remember it was a Mary Poppins movie. Let me recall when that came out. Mary Poppins was based on a book by Roald Dahl right?

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what the phrase ""Tippecanoe and Tyler Too"" means. From the context given it's originally called ""Tip and Ty."" It was a campaign song for the Whig Party during the Log Cabin Campaign in 1840.  The lyrics praised Harrison and Tyler while attacking Martin Van Buren. So I think ""Tippecanoe"" refers to William Henry Harrison because that's his nickname. But what about ""Tyler Too""? Well John Tyler was Harrison's vice president so maybe it's just a reference to him as well.   Putting it together ""Tippecanoe and Tyler Too"" is a play on words. Tippecanoe itself isn't a real place; it's a fictional town from the early 19th century probably created for the song. So when they say ""Tippecanoe "" it's referring to Harrison by his nickname but also includes ""Tyler Too"" as another Whig candidate. This clever pun highlights their support for both candidates against Van Buren.  I should make sure I'm not missing anything else in the context but that seems to cover the main points. The phrase is a clever way to promote two candidates while criticizing the third.  The phrase ""Tippecanoe and Tyler Too"" is a pun referencing William Henry Harrison (by his nickname) and John Tyler as Whig candidates using a fictional town name to highlight their support against Martin Van Buren.", phrase tippecanoe and tyler too is pun referencing william henry harrison by his nickname and john tyler as whig candidates using fictional town name to highlight their support against martin van buren,"Whig candidates William Henry Harrison (the ""hero of Tippecanoe"") and John Tyler",0,0.41860465116279066,2.51152890000958,0.0008716200805248256,0.00025592560244382703,0.0,0.0,0.0
809,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: Hansen or Hanssen ( Danish pronunciation : ( ˈhænsn̩ ) ) is a Scandinavian patronymic surname , meaning son of Hans . As of 2008 , it is the third most common surname in Denmark , shared by 4.3 % of the population . As of 2000 , Hansen is the single most common surname in Norway , not counting spelling variations such as Hanssen , which are also quite common . In the Faroe Islands Hansen is the second most common surname , while in the North German federal states of Schleswig - Holstein and Hamburg Hansen is the third and fifth most common surname , respectively . In Sweden the parallel form is Hansson . The frequent occurrences of Hansen as a surname outside Denmark , Norway and Schleswig - Holstein is due to immigration , though Nordic immigrants to English - speaking countries often anglicised their names to Hanson in order to accommodate English orthographic rules .
Question: where does the last name hansen come from
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the last name Hansen comes from. The question is asking about its origin and based on the provided context I should find information there.  Looking at the context it mentions that ""Hansen"" is a Scandinavian patronymic surname. The meaning given is ""son of Hans."" That seems straightforward; it's derived from the first name Hansen or Hans. So the last name isn't of German origin but rather a common name in some Scandinavian countries.  The context also provides some data on where Hansen is most commonly found and used. For example as of 2008 Hansen was the third most common surname in Denmark at 4.3% and the single most common in Norway (excluding variations like Hanssen). In other places like the Faroe Islands Schleswig-Holstein Hamburg Sweden uses Hansson instead.  Additionally it mentions that outside of these Scandinavian countries Hansen's prevalence is due to immigration especially Nordic immigrants moving to English-speaking countries where they often anglicized their names to Hanson. This suggests that while it's a common name in some Scandic countries its use elsewhere might be influenced by cultural or naming conventions from other regions.  So putting this together the origin of Hansen as a last name is primarily from Scandinavian backgrounds specifically derived from the name Hans and used as a patronymic form. The context doesn't provide information about whether it's of Germanic origin or evolved over time in those regions.  The surname Hansen originates from the Scandinavian region where it means ""son of Hans."" It was a common name among Scandinavians before becoming a surname. Outside Denmark and Norway its use is largely due to immigration and anglicization in other countries.  Answer: The last name Hansen comes from the Scandinavian region meaning ""son of Hans "" and has become popular as a surname primarily in Scandinavian countries.", last name hansen comes from scandinavian region meaning son of hans and has become popular as surname primarily in scandinavian countries,"a Scandinavian patronymic surname, meaning son of Hans",0,0.42857142857142855,3.1807412000052864,0.0011089877307583645,0.0003256216319916041,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: Christmas Day on December 25 is a national holiday in Brazil . But because Brazil lies in the Southern Hemisphere , Brazilians celebrate Christmas in the summer . In the small cities in the entire country , as well as in the largest cities , like São Paulo , Rio de Janeiro , Recife , Salvador , Fortaleza , Curitiba , Porto Alegre , Brasília , Manaus , Belém , Natal and Belo Horizonte , the celebrations resemble in many ways the traditions in Europe and North America , with the Christmas tree , the exchanging of gifts and Christmas cards , the decoration of houses and buildings with electric lights and the nativity scene . Despite the warm tropical summer weather , some incongruences such as decorations with themes of winter and snow are not uncommon . In some cities like Guarapuava , there are decoration contests , when judges go to houses to look at the decorations , inside or outside of the house , and decide the most beautiful house . Christmas Eve is the most important day . Unlike in the North American and Anglo - Saxon tradition , Christmas takes action mainly near midnight , usually with big family dinners , opening of gifts and the celebration of the `` Missa do Galo '' ( the rooster 's mass ) in churches throughout the nation .
Question: what is the symbol for christmas in brazil
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what the symbol for Christmas is in Brazil. From the context given it seems like Brazil celebrates Christmas as a national holiday even though it's in the Southern Hemisphere. The context mentions that they have traditions similar to Europe and North America during Christmas.  Looking at the details provided: they mention things like Christmas trees exchanging gifts Christmas cards decorating houses with electric lights and the nativity scene. These are all common symbols associated with Christmas in many countries so it makes sense that Brazil would use them too.   I don't see any information indicating that Brazil has a different symbol for Christmas compared to these traditional elements mentioned. So the symbols they're using are probably the same as other Christian celebrations around the world.  Therefore the symbol should be the Christmas tree. That's the most obvious and widely recognized symbol of Christmas.  The symbol for Christmas in Brazil is the Christmas tree., symbol for christmas in brazil is christmas tree,Christmas Tree,0,0.4,1.6677802999911364,0.0005686190818491332,0.00016695827039192492,0.0,0.0,0.0
811,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: The term prime minister in its French form , premier ministre , is attested in 17th Century sources referring to Cardinal Richelieu after he was named to head the royal council in 1624 . The title was however informal and used alongside the equally informal principal ministre d'État ( `` chief minister of the state '' ) more as a job description . After 1661 , Louis XIV and his descendants refused to allow one of their ministers to be more important than the others , so the term was not in use .
Question: when was the term prime minister first used
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out when the term ""prime minister"" was first used. The context provided mentions that the French term ""premier ministre"" was attested in the 17th Century referring to Cardinal Richelieu after he was named to head the royal council in 1624. It also says that before 1661 the title was used informally alongside ""principal ministre d'État."" However after 1661 Louis XIV and his descendants stopped using it.  So looking at this the first use of the term would be around when it started being officially used. Since in 1624 Richelieu was named to head the royal council but that's under ""minister"" perhaps? The context says ""premier ministre"" was attested in the 17th Century so maybe after 1624. But when exactly?  The answer provided is 1624 which seems to align with Richelieu being named to head the council. So I think that's the first time it was used officially.  The term ""prime minister"" was first used in 1624 when Cardinal Richelieu was appointed to head the royal council.

Question: what channel is abc on in phoenix arizona
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out what the ABC channel is on in Phoenix Arizona based on the provided context. Let me go through the data step by step.  First I'll scan through each city and their respective channels looking for mentions of ""ABC"" or any associated networks like TBN (which sometimes carries ABC programming).  Looking at Phoenix under the entry for Phoenix there are several entries with channel numbers and call signs:  - KPAZ - TV: TBN Church Channel on 21.2 - KTVW - DT: UNI Grit on 33.3 Bounce TV on 33.4  Wait I don't see ABC mentioned here. Let me check other cities just in case there might be a different entry elsewhere.  Checking Phoenix again more carefully:  Looking at the list under Phoenix KPAZ is TBN-related. The others like KNXV KPHO etc. also mention different networks but not ABC directly. Hmm.  Wait maybe I missed something. Let me check again:   In the context provided under Phoenix there's KTVW with some channels on 33.x and 45.x. But no ABC listed. So perhaps ABC isn't directly listed here but looking at other cities like Yuma Yuma has KECY - TV Fox ABC on 9.2.  Wait so in Yuma ABC is on channel 9 via KECY. Maybe the user is asking for Phoenix as well. But from the data given it seems ABC isn't directly listed under Phoenix. Alternatively perhaps ABC is part of another network like TBN or something else.   Looking back at the context KPAZ - TV has ""TBN Church Channel on 21.2 "" so that's TBN in Phoenix. There's also KNXV: ABC Antenna TV on 15.2 and Laff on 15.3. So ABC is on channel 15 via KNXV.  Wait yes! KPHO - TV CBS Cozi TV on 5.2 but KNXV is another channel under Phoenix that says ABC Antenna TV on 15.2. So in Phoenix ABC is on channel 15 via KNXV.  I think I initially overlooked it because the first mention of Phoenix was KPAZ - TBN but there's another entry for KNXV with ABC.

Question: who cooks for the president of the united states
Answer: ",Alright so I need to figure out who cooks for the President of the United States based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that as of 2011 the White House Executive Chef used certain kitchen appliances and equipment. It lists things like a natural gas oven and range manufactured by Vulcan Restaurant Equipment a Traulsen refrigerator and freezer an espresso machine from Cimbali M32 a Hobart 300 gravity-fed food slicer stainless steel pots and pans from Mauviel and knives from Misono.  So the White House Executive Chef is the one cooking for the President. That's pretty clear. The context doesn't mention anyone else handling cooking duties or specifically refers to a chef or culinary staff within the White House. It only talks about the equipment used by the Executive Chef.  I don't see any information here suggesting that someone other than the Executive Chef is involved in cooking for the President.

Question: where was the film coming home for christmas filmed
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out where ""The Film Coming Home for Christmas"" was filmed. The user provided some context about a movie filmed in British Columbia specifically in Abbotsford Vancouver and Langley areas around August 2017. There's mention of a mansion in Aldergrove area of Langley being the central property.  But wait the question is asking where it came home for Christmas. Hmm that might be different from where it was filmed. Maybe ""came home"" refers to where it was released or distributed? Or perhaps it's a typo and they meant when it was shot?  Looking back at the context it only talks about filming locations in British Columbia during August 2017. So if the question is about where the film itself is coming from for Christmas that could be asking for release information or maybe distribution centers.  But since the context doesn't mention anything about distribution dates or release locations beyond filming areas I can't find specific info on where it came home for Christmas. The filming was in British Columbia's Abbotsford Vancouver and Langley but without more details on release schedules or distribution paths I might not have enough information to answer that part.

Question: when do the new episodes of supernatural start
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out when the new episodes of ""Supernatural"" will start. The user provided a list of episodes with titles and details but didn't mention any specific air dates or release schedules beyond the year 2018. My task is to determine when these episodes are set to premiere.  First looking at the format of each entry: they have an episode title a date in parentheses (like May 3 2018) and sometimes some details about the plot. The last few entries (285-287) don't specify a date but only mention that it's TBA (to be announced).   I know that ""Supernatural"" typically releases episodes in seasons around mid to late May each year often following major holidays like Memorial Day or Cinco de Mayo. The last season before the given list was season 17 which ended on May 30 2018. Seasons usually premiere a few weeks after they wrap up.  Looking at the dates provided: episode 285 is listed as TBA with a placeholder date of May 3 2018. Episode 286 has no specific date but mentions it's TBD and also lists May 10 2018. Episode 287 similarly has no date but suggests it's related to May.  Given that the last episode in the provided list ends on May 3 2018 it's likely that the next season (season 18) will start around Memorial Day or a few weeks after. So season 18 probably starts around mid-May maybe as early as May 6th.  The user also included an example answer from another assistant where they concluded that new episodes started on May 7 2018 based on the previous season's end date of May 30 2017. That makes sense because adding about a week or so to May 30 would land around June 6th but considering some might start sooner after wrapping up.  However in this case since the last provided episode ends on May 3 2018 it's reasonable to assume that season 18 starts shortly after perhaps as early as May 7 2018. The answer from another user suggested May 7 but given that the previous season ended on May 30 adding a week would bring us closer to June. But considering the user’s example used the next day after the previous season ended maybe it's around mid-May.  I'm a bit confused because in one example they concluded May 7th which is just two days after the last episode of season 17 on May 30th but that seems too soon. More likely new episodes would air about six weeks after the previous season ends to give viewers time to catch up.  So if season 17 ended on May 30 adding about six weeks brings us to July 6 or so. But since the last episode in the list is from 2018 (May 3) maybe they are wrapping up that same year's season which would mean season 18 starts after summer.  But considering the user included a previous example where they added around two weeks perhaps the new season starts around June. However without exact information it's hard to be precise.  The new episodes of ""Supernatural"" are set to premiere in mid-May following the conclusion of season 17 which ended on May 30 2018. Therefore the start date for the new season (season 18) is likely around June or early July.

Context: Tyrann Devine Mathieu ( / ˈtaɪrən ˈmæθjuː / ; born May 13 , 1992 ) is an American football safety for the Houston Texans of the National Football League ( NFL ) . He played college football for Louisiana State University ( LSU ) . In college , he developed a reputation for causing turnovers , setting a Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) record with 11 career forced fumbles and earning the nickname , `` Honey Badger '' . In his sophomore season , he was recognized as a consensus All - American , won the Chuck Bednarik Award as the best defensive player in college football , and was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy . Mathieu was dismissed from the LSU football program after that season due to a violation of team rules .
Question: what football player is called the honey badger
Answer: ","Alright so I'm trying to figure out which football player is called the Honey Badger based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through the information carefully.  The context mentions Tyrann Devine Mathieu an American football safety for the Houston Texans in the NFL. He played college football at Louisiana State University (LSU). At LSU he gained a reputation for causing turnovers and set an SEC record with 11 career forced fumbles. Because of this he earned the nickname ""Honey Badger.""  Wait so from that it seems like the Honey Badger is his nickname. The context describes him as having caused a lot of turnovers and getting that specific nickname. So putting it all together the player named as the Honey Badger is Tyrann Devine Mathieu.  I don't see any other players mentioned in the context who might have similar nicknames or roles. Mathieu's achievements include being a consensus All-American winning the Chuck Bednarik Award and almost winning the Heisman Trophy before he was dismissed from LSU. All of these points support that he is associated with the ""Honey Badger"" nickname.  I'm pretty confident here because the context directly ties his reputation to the nickname without mentioning other players or teams. So there's no ambiguity; Mathieu is clearly referred to as the Honey Badger in this context.  Tyrann Devine Mathieu is called the Honey Badger.",tyrann devine mathieu is called honey badger,Tyrann Devine Mathieu,0,0.6,2.538171300009708,0.0008748822667608644,0.0002568834474916826,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: `` The New Colossus '' was the first entry read at the exhibit 's opening on November 2 , 1883 , and remained associated with the exhibit through a published catalog until the exhibit closed after the pedestal was fully funded in August 1885 , but was forgotten and played no role at the opening of the statue in 1886 . It was , however , published in Joseph Pulitzer 's New York World as well as The New York Times during this time period . In 1901 , Lazarus 's friend Georgina Schuyler began an effort to memorialize Lazarus and her poem , which succeeded in 1903 when a plaque bearing the text of the poem was put on the inner wall of the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty .
Question: where is the inscription on the statue of liberty
Answer: ",Okay so I need to find out where the inscription on the Statue of Liberty is located. From what I remember reading there's a plaque inside the pedestal that was placed by Lazarus's friend Georgina Schuyler in 1903. Wait but also there was something called The New Colossus mentioned before which was published in newspapers around 1886. But wasn't that one forgotten after the statue was opened? So maybe the main inscription is on a different part of the statue.  I think the answer provided earlier said the inscription is inside the pedestal. That makes sense because Georgina Schuyler put it there so she would know where to place it. The name Lazarus isn't mentioned in that context so perhaps that's another plaque or information elsewhere.  So putting this together the main inscription on the Statue of Liberty is indeed inside the pedestal as per the information given.

Context: An autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power ( social and political ) is concentrated in the hands of one person , whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control ( except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d'état or mass insurrection ) . Absolute monarchy ( such as Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , Oman , Brunei and Swaziland ) and dictatorships ( such as North Korea ) are the main modern day forms of autocracy .
Question: who makes the important government decisions in an autocracy
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who makes the important government decisions in an autocracy based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that an autocracy is a system where supreme power both social and political is concentrated in one person. That person's decisions aren't subject to external legal restraints or regularized mechanisms of popular control except maybe for threats like coups or mass insurrection.  So from this it seems the key point is that there's one person with all the power. Therefore that single individual makes the important government decisions.  I should make sure I'm not adding any extra information beyond what's given. The context mentions examples like absolute monarchies and dictatorships but the main takeaway is that it's a single ruler who decides everything.

Question: who did dwight howard play for last year
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which team Dwight Howard played for last year. Let's see what the context says.  Looking through the provided context it mentions several teams that Dwight Howard has been with in his career. The context lists his playing history from 2004 onwards.   First it breaks down his career into different periods: - From 2004 to 2012: Orlando Magic - 2013: Los Angeles Lakers - 2013 to 2016: Houston Rockets - 2017 to present: Atlanta Hawks and now Charlotte Hornets since the 2016-17 season.  The question is about last year. Assuming ""last year"" refers to the current year or the most recent season before that. If we consider the context as of mid-2023 then last year would be 2022-2023.   Looking at the teams he played for in recent years: - Atlanta Hawks from 2017 onwards - Then Charlotte Hornets since they rebranded in 2016.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what the largest man-made lake in the U.S. is. The context provided mentions ""100 Beaver Lake Arkansas 44.06 sq mi 114 km man - made."" Let me break this down.  First ""Beaver Lake"" is a place in Arkansas. It has an area of about 44 square miles. Then it says ""man-made "" so that's key—it's not naturally occurring.   The question is asking for the largest such lake in the U.S. and based on the context given Beaver Lake seems to be a candidate with its man-made status and size. However I'm not sure if there are larger ones elsewhere. Maybe it's actually the largest? Or maybe there's another one.  Wait I think I remember that Lake Michigan is one of the Great Lakes but they're natural. So probably not. What about in Arkansas specifically? Beaver Lake is a reservoir created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood control and power generation.   Given that 44 square miles is its area I don't recall any other man-made lake in the U.S. being larger than this. There might be others elsewhere but according to this context Beaver Lake Arkansas is the largest.  I should double-check if there's a bigger one but since the question provides only this information I'll go with what's given.

Question: where is the largest salt mine in the us
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the largest salt mine in the US is based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again to make sure I don't miss any details.  The context lists several countries and their respective salt mines or production sites. I'm looking specifically for information about the United States' largest salt mine. Scanning through I see a mention of Hutchinson in Kansas where underground mining began in 1923. Then it says that in 1990 the Hutchinson Salt Company was formed and purchased the mine.  Further down there's an entry about Saltville Virginia which served as one of the Confederacy's main saltworks. Additionally Western New York and Central New York are mentioned with American Rock Salt being the largest operating mine in the US capable of producing up to 18 000 tons daily.  Wait a minute so there are two places listed that are significant: Hutchinson (Kansas) and Saltville (Virginia). But I need to determine which one is larger. The context doesn't specify sizes for Hutchinson or Saltville directly but mentions American Rock Salt in Western/Central New York as the largest with a certain production capacity.  So maybe the answer isn't just one mine but an area. Since the user asked where it's located and American Rock Salt is mentioned as being in Western New York and Central New York I should probably mention that region as the location of the largest salt mine.

Question: who played desmond doss father in hacksaw ridge
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who played Desmond Doss' father in ""Hacksaw Ridge."" I remember that the movie is based on a true story about a World War I soldier. Desmond Doss was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery but now I'm trying to recall if he had any family members involved.  I think the main character is Desmond's son Robert Doss who becomes the protagonist in the film. But since the question is about Desmond's father I should check if there were any scenes mentioning him. Maybe in the credits or during his involvement with the Union soldiers?  Wait the context provided mentions that Hacksaw Ridge won several awards including Best Editing and Sound Mixing but doesn't explicitly talk about the cast. So maybe I have to infer based on general knowledge. Desmond Doss was from a family of farmers so perhaps his father is portrayed as an ordinary man who supported him during their war service.  I don't recall seeing any specific names mentioned in the movie for Desmond's father. The focus seems to be more on Desmond's experiences and Robert's growth. Therefore it's possible that Desmond Doss' father isn't given a prominent role in the film or his appearance is not extensive enough to be featured.  So based on this information I would answer that Desmond Doss didn't have a notable actor portray him in the film ""Hacksaw Ridge.""  Desmond Doss did not have a notable actor portray him in the film ""Hacksaw Ridge.""

There are different styles mentioned too—cursive for religious texts on papyrus and wood later hieratic demotic and Meroitic which derived from hieroglyphic writing.  Wait but the question is asking about what type of writing they used so I should probably focus on the main one. Hieroglyphs were the formal system while others like hieratic were more shorthand.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who sang ""I'm Going to Soak Up the Sun."" Hmm. Wait in the context provided earlier there's a song called ""Soak Up the Sun"" by Sheryl Crow that peaked at number one on several charts. But when I look for the exact match with the title ""I'm Going to Soak Up the Sun "" it doesn't seem to be the same as the one mentioned.  Wait maybe there are different songs with similar titles? Let me check the context again. The context says that ""Soak Up the Sun"" was released in March 2002 by Sheryl Crow. It features Liz Phair on backing vocals. So that's her single from C'mon C'mon.

But the user is asking for ""I'm Going to Soak Up the Sun "" which might be another version or a different song entirely.  Alternatively perhaps there's an error in the question?

Question: only player to play for manchester united manchester city liverpool and everton
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which players only played for Manchester United Manchester City Liverpool and Everton based on the given context. Let me go through the context step by step.  First the context talks about a player who left Newcastle on August 18 1997 for £450 000 and joined Bolton Wanderers. But he didn't stay long there—he only made 21 appearances and got relegated from the Premier League after just one season. So that's not relevant to the question.  Then he went on loan to Manchester City and played six times in Division One. So he was with Manchester City during this period.  After that it says his loan spell took him to Manchester United but actually wait—no let me read again: ""This loan spell made Beardsley the only player to play for both top-flight teams in Liverpool and Manchester."" Oh so after Bolton Wanderers and Manchester City he went on loan to Liverpool.   Wait no—that seems conflicting with what I thought earlier. Let me parse it carefully.  The context says: He left Newcastle... joining Bolton Wanderers where he made 21 appearances but was unable to save them from being relegated. Then he went on loan to Manchester City where he played six times in Division One. This loan spell made Beardsley the only player to play for both top-flight teams in Liverpool and Manchester.  Hmm so that suggests that after Manchester City he joined Liverpool on loan? Or did he go back to Manchester United?  Wait no—the context says ""This loan spell made Beardsley the only player to play for both top-flight teams in Liverpool and Manchester."" So this loan spell was a move to Liverpool or Manchester? It's a bit confusing.  Wait perhaps it means that during his time with Manchester City he was on loan to another club. Wait no—let me read again: He left Newcastle joined Bolton Wanderers (21 appearances got relegated). Then went on loan to Manchester City where he played six times in Division One. Then ""this loan spell made Beardsley the only player..."" So that suggests that this loan was a separate spell elsewhere.  Wait perhaps I misread it. Let me re-read:  ""He then went on loan to Manchester City  where he played six times in Division One . This loan spell made Beardsley the only player to play for both top - flight teams in Liverpool and Manchester .""  Oh! So after Bolton Wanderers he joined Manchester City (loan) playing 6 times. Then this Manchester City loan ""made"" him the only player to have played for both Liverpool and Manchester top-flight teams.  Wait that still doesn't clarify where he went next. Maybe after Manchester City he went to Liverpool on loan? But then it says ""top flight teams in Liverpool and Manchester "" implying he was with Manchester United or something else. Hmm this is a bit confusing.  Alternatively perhaps the ""loan spell"" refers to being loaned from one club to another so after Manchester City he played for another club which is either Liverpool or Manchester United? But according to the context it's the only player who played for both top-flight teams in Liverpool and Manchester. So maybe his career was: Newcastle -> Bolton Wanderers (relegated) -> Manchester City (loan) -> Liverpool on loan.  But wait after leaving Bolton Wanderers he joined Manchester City on loan then ""this loan spell made Beardsley the only player..."" to play for both Liverpool and Manchester top flight teams. So perhaps during his time with Manchester City he was also playing for another club where they are based in Liverpool or Manchester?  Wait no—because ""loan"" implies he left Manchester City and went elsewhere on loan.  Alternatively maybe it's a typo and he went to Manchester United instead of Liverpool? Because the question is about players who played for Manchester United Manchester City Liverpool and Everton. Wait but the context doesn't mention Everton at all except for Newcastle.  Wait let me read again:  ""He left Newcastle for the second time on 18 August 1997 for £450 000  joining Bolton Wanderers  where he made 21 appearances but was unable to save them from being relegated from the Premier League just one season after promotion . He then went on loan to Manchester City  where he played six times in Division One . This loan spell made Beardsley the only player to play for both top - flight teams in Liverpool and Manchester.""  Wait so after Bolton Wanderers (promoted then immediately relegated) he went to Manchester City on loan. Then this Manchester City loan ""made"" him the only player who played for both Liverpool and Manchester top flight teams.  So that would imply that during his time with Manchester City maybe he also played for a club in Liverpool? But how?  Alternatively perhaps after Manchester City he played for Liverpool as well on loan making him the only player to have played for both. So he was with Manchester City first then with Liverpool on loan.  But according to the context it says ""this loan spell made Beardsley the only player..."" which refers to his previous loans? Or this one specifically?  Wait perhaps the structure is:  1. Newcastle 2. Bolton Wanderers (relegated) 3. Manchester City (loan) where he played 6 times. 4. Liverpool on loan.  But then it says ""this loan spell made Beardsley..."" which refers to his time with Manchester City—so that this act of being on loan to Manchester City made him the only player who played for both Liverpool and Manchester top flight teams.  So perhaps during his time at Manchester City he also played for a club in Liverpool. But that seems unlikely unless it's a joint venture or something else.  Alternatively maybe Beardsley was transferred from Manchester City to Liverpool on loan as part of this spell. So after Manchester City he went to Liverpool and played there too.  Wait but the question is asking who played for Manchester United Manchester City Liverpool and Everton. From the context Beardsley played for Newcastle Bolton Wanderers (which was in England's lower leagues) Manchester City on loan and then Liverpool on loan. He never played for Manchester United or Everton.  But wait the initial statement says he left Newcastle for £450k to join Bolton Wanderers—newcastle is a top tier club too so perhaps the question includes that as well? But no the user's question specifically mentions Manchester United Manchester City Liverpool and Everton. So if Beardsley didn't play for Man Utd or Everton in this context then maybe he's not the one.  Wait but wait—let me check again: The question is ""only player to play for manchester united manchester city liverpool and everton"". From the context:  He played for Bolton Wanderers (Manchester) Manchester City (Man City) Liverpool on loan. So that's three clubs: Man Utd not mentioned.  Wait perhaps I misread the context. Let me go back.  The first part is he left Newcastle to join Bolton Wanderers—so he was with Newcastle before that? Or did he leave Newcastle and then go to Bolton Wanderers?  Wait let me parse this:  ""He left Newcastle for the second time on 18 August 1997 for £450 000  joining Bolton Wanderers  where he made 21 appearances but was unable to save them from being relegated from the Premier League just one season after promotion . He then went on loan to Manchester City  where he played six times in Division One . This loan spell made Beardsley the only player to play for both top - flight teams in Liverpool and Manchester.""  Wait so he left Newcastle went to Bolton Wanderers (which is a lower division club) then on loan to Man City. So he never played for Manchester United or Everton.  So unless there's another player mentioned here but the context seems to only mention Beardsley as the one who made those moves.  But the question is about someone who played for all four: Man Utd Man City Liverpool and Everton.  Wait perhaps ""Manchester United"" in the context refers to the top flight which includes Manchester United but also other clubs like Liverpool. So maybe Beardsley played for Liverpool (top tier) Manchester City (second tier) Manchester United (first tier) or something else? But according to the context he only played for Bolton Wanderers Manchester City on loan and Liverpool on loan.  Wait unless ""this loan spell made him the only player who played for both top flight teams in Liverpool and Manchester""—so perhaps during his time with Manchester City he also played for a club based in Manchester but that's not relevant to Man Utd. Unless Man Utd is in Manchester as well.  But the question specifically asks about Manchester United so unless Beardsley played there too which isn't mentioned.  So maybe the answer is that no one did but according to the context provided it seems like Beardsley was with Bolton Wanderers Manchester City and Liverpool on loan. But the question wants someone who played for all four: Man Utd Man City Liverpool and Everton.  Wait perhaps I misread the names—let me check:  The person's name is ""Beardsley."" The context says he left Newcastle to join Bolton Wanderers then Manchester City then Liverpool on loan. So he didn't play for Man Utd or Everton in this timeline.  But the question is about a player who played for all four: Man Utd Man City Liverpool and Everton.  Wait perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe Beardsley was a goalkeeper? Or maybe another player entirely?  Alternatively perhaps the answer refers to someone else but from the given context it seems only Beardsley is mentioned so unless he played for Man Utd as well which isn't indicated here.  Wait but in the context after leaving Bolton Wanderers and Manchester City he was with Liverpool on loan. So he didn't play for Man Utd or Everton.  So perhaps the answer is that no one did it based on this context but since the question implies that someone does maybe Beardsley wasn't playing for Man Utd in the first place.  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline:  - Beardsley: Newcastle → Bolton Wanderers (relegated) → Manchester City (loan) played 6 times → Liverpool on loan.   No mention of Man Utd or Everton.  So perhaps the answer is that there's no such player in this context but since the question expects an answer based on the context maybe I'm missing something.  Wait perhaps ""both top - flight teams in Liverpool and Manchester"" refers to playing for both Man Utd (in Manchester) and Liverpool. So Beardsley played for both meaning he was with Man Utd as well?  But the context doesn't mention that; it says he was on loan to Manchester City then Liverpool.  Hmm this is tricky. Maybe I should go back to the question: ""only player to play for manchester united manchester city liverpool and everton.""  Given the context Beardsley played for:  - Bolton Wanderers (Manchester) - Manchester City - Liverpool on loan  So that's three clubs in England top flight.  But Man Utd is a different club. So perhaps he didn't play there.  Wait unless ""both top - flight teams in Liverpool and Manchester"" refers to both Liverpool FC and Manchester United? Because they're both based in England but in different cities. So Beardsley was the only player who played for both Liverpool (in Liverpool) and Manchester United (in Manchester). But does that fit?  But according to the context after Manchester City he went to Liverpool on loan. So perhaps during his time with Manchester City he also played for another club in Manchester? That doesn't make sense.  Alternatively maybe the ""loan spell"" refers to playing for both Man Utd and Liverpool? But the context says it made him the only player who played for both Liverpool and Manchester top flight teams implying Man Utd is part of the mix. So perhaps he played for Man Utd as well.  But in the given context it's not mentioned; Beardsley was with Man City and then Liverpool on loan. Unless ""both top flight teams"" includes both Liverpool and Man Utd due to their geographical proximity or something else.  This is confusing. Maybe I should conclude that based on the given context there is no player who played for all four: Man Utd Man City Liverpool and Everton. But since the question expects an answer perhaps it's a trick and Beardsley wasn't playing for Man Utd or Everton.  Wait but if Beardsley didn't play for Man Utd then he can't be the one. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The context mentions that during his time with Manchester City he played six times in Division One—maybe Division One refers to the top flight? If so then perhaps he was with Man City (Division One) and Liverpool on loan but not Man Utd.  So maybe the answer is that no one did it based on this context. But since the question states ""only player "" I think the intended answer might be Beardsley assuming that during his time at Manchester City he also played for Man Utd or Everton.  Alternatively perhaps the ""both top flight teams in Liverpool and Manchester"" includes both Liverpool and Manchester United as separate clubs under their respective leagues. So maybe Beardsley was with both making him unique.  But I'm not entirely sure. Given that perhaps the answer is Beardsley.  Beardsley played for Bolton Wanderers (Manchester) Manchester City and Liverpool on loan. However based on the provided context there's no mention of him playing for Manchester United or Everton.   Answer: There is no player mentioned in this context who played for Manchester United Manchester City Liverpool and Everton.  But since the question implies a specific answer exists within the given context it's possible that Beardsley was the intended answer despite not being explicitly stated to have played for Man Utd or Everton.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what the buckeye is the mascot for Ohio State University. Hmm from the context given earlier it says ""Brutus Buckeye Attacked By Ohio Bobcat."" That sounds like a nickname or maybe even an official mascot reference.  Wait Buckeye and Bobcat are both mascots. Buckeye is a well-known one in Ohio; it's been used by OSU for a long time. I remember that the Buckeye is associated with Ohio State football basketball and other sports teams. So probably the buckeye itself is their main mascot.  But just to make sure sometimes universities have different mascots per school or sport but in this context it's specifically talking about Buckeye being attacked by a Bobcat. Since a Bobcat is another term used by Ohio State maybe that's referring to the sports team mascot as well.  So putting it together the Buckeye is the university's main mascot.

Question: where does the cell spend most of its time in the cell cycle
Answer: ",Alright I need to figure out where a typical cell spends most of its life during the cell cycle. From the context provided it mentions that interphase is the phase where cells spend the majority of their time. It describes interphase as a period where the cell copies its DNA and prepares for mitosis among other normal functions.  Wait but I should make sure if there's any mention about the stages beyond interphase. The context also talks about prophase being the first stage of mitosis so after interphase comes prophase when the nucleus starts to divide. But since interphase is where most of the cell cycle happens that must be where it spends most of its time.

Question: where did the california gold rush take place
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the California Gold Rush took place based on the provided context. The context mentions several authors whose works reflect the literary history of the Gold Rush including Mark Twain Bret Harte Joaquin Miller and others. Specifically it lists ""The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County"" by Mark Twain ""A Millionaire of Rough-and-Ready"" by Bret Harte and ""Life Amongst the Modocs"" by Joaquin Miller.  I remember that Mark Twain's book is set in California. I think it's about a person named Charlierather who goes to California during the Gold Rush. Similarly Bret Harte's novel probably takes place there too. The title ""Rough-and-Ready"" suggests it was in the early stages of theGold Rush when conditions were rough.  Joaquin Miller's book might also be set there since he wrote a lot about frontier life. So putting this together all these authors' works are reflecting events that happened in California during the Gold Rush era.  I don't think the other places mentioned like France or Spain are correct because those aren't associated with the California Gold Rush specifically.

Question: who is ishani in lies of the heart
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who Ishani is from the context given. The user provided a context where ""Nalini Negi as Ishaani Ishaan Sinha."" Hmm that seems like it's linking two names: Nalini Negi and Ishaani Ishaan Sinha. Maybe Ishaani is a character or a person in some story or show.  The question is asking who Ishani is from ""Lies of the Heart."" I know that ""Lies of the Heart"" is a book by Jhumpa Lahiri which deals with themes like marriage family and secrets. It's also been adapted into an Indian film.   Putting it all together: Nalini Negi was in the movie version of ""Lies of the Heart."" So perhaps Ishaani Ishaan Sinha is a character from that movie adaptation. Wait but the name has some repetition with ""Ishaan"" spelled twice. Maybe it's a typo or a specific way the name is written.  Alternatively maybe Ishaani is a character in the book who goes by the name Ishti? Or perhaps she's another character. I'm not entirely sure but given that Nalini Negi played Ishaani in the film adaptation of ""Lies of the Heart "" it's likely that Ishaani refers to her on screen persona.  So considering all this I think Ishani is referring to Nalini Negi's character in the movie. Maybe she has a different name or stage name. Alternatively perhaps Ishti is another way to spell her name within the context of ""Lies of the Heart.""  Wait maybe it's that Ishaani Sinha is a real person who played Ishti? But that doesn't make much sense because Nalini Negi was the one in the film adaptation.  I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down again:  - Context: ""Nalini Negi as Ishaani Ishaan Sinha""  So someone named Ishaani is playing a role similar to Nalini Negi's character in a movie based on ""Lies of the Heart."" Maybe Ishaani refers to that character.  But since ""Lies of the Heart"" has specific characters perhaps Ishaani is one of them. Alternatively maybe it's a different angle. If Ishti is another name for Nalini then she might be playing Ishti in the film.  Wait the user mentioned ""Ishaan Sinha."" Maybe that's part of her real name or stage name? Or perhaps Ishaani is a nickname or mishearing.  Alternatively maybe it's a mistake and the correct character is Ishaan which is similar to Ishti. So Ishaani could be referring to Nalini Negi's character in the film.  In any case without more context I'll go with what I know: that Nalini Negi played the role of Ishaani/Ishita in the 2014 film adaptation of ""Lies of the Heart."" So Ishani would be referring to her on-screen persona.  Ishanis as portrayed by Nalini Negi in the 2014 film adaptation of ""Lies of the Heart "" is a character whose name may have variations such as Ishaani or Ishti. Her role mirrors that of Ishaan Sinha suggesting she plays the part of Ishaani/Ishita within the narrative.

These men were the church sexton Robert Newman and Captain John Pulling -- the two of whom historian David Hackett Fischer suggests each carried one lantern up to the steeple -- as well as Thomas Bernard , who stood watch for British troops outside the church . The lanterns were displayed to send a warning to Charlestown patriots across the Charles River about the movements of the British Army . Revere and William Dawes would later deliver the same message to Lexington themselves , but this lantern method was a fast way to inform the back - up riders in Charlestown about the movements of the British ; these back - up riders planned to deliver the warning message to Lexington and Concord in case Revere and Dawes were arrested on the way .
Question: who hung the lanterns in the old north church
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who hung the lanterns in the old North Church based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context starts by mentioning that in April 1775 Paul Revere told three Boston patriots to hang two lanterns in the steeple. These three individuals are Robert Newman Captain John Pulling and Thomas Bernard. It goes on to explain that each of these men carried one lantern up to the steeple. The lanterns were used as a warning to the Charlestown patriots about British troop movements.  So from this information I can see that the task is to identify who those three individuals were—Paul Revere's three patriots—and specifically determine which ones hung the lanterns in the old North Church.  Looking at the names: Robert Newman was the church sexton Captain John Pulling was a officer and Thomas Bernard was someone who stood watch outside for British troops. All three were involved in hanging the lanterns.   The question is asking who specifically performed this act of hanging the lanterns.

Question: who sings i wanna rock'n'roll all night
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who sings the song ""I Wanna Rock 'n Roll All Night."" From what I remember reading before there's a song called ""Rock and Roll All Nite"" by Kiss. Wait that might be the same song but with different wording in the title.  Let me look back at the context provided. The context mentions that ""Rock and Roll All Nite"" is a song by Kiss released from their 1975 album Dressed to Kill. It was the A-side of their fifth single featuring the album track ""Getaway.""   The studio version peaked at No. 68 on the Billboard singles chart which was better than their previous single ""Kissin' Time"" at No. 89. Then there's a live version released in October 1975 that reached No. 12 early in 1976 and became one of six songs for Kiss that made the Top 20 in the '70s.  This live version also became their signature song and is used as the closing number in almost every concert since 1976. In 2008 it was named the 16th greatest hard rock song by VH1.  Wait a second so ""Rock and Roll All Nite"" is their main single from that time. But the user is asking about ""I Wanna Rock 'n Roll All Night."" There might be another version or a different song with similar title but slightly altered lyrics.  Alternatively maybe it's just a slight variation of the same song. In some cases bands release cover versions under different names. So perhaps this is the live version or a different recording. Given that the main single was ""Rock and Roll All Nite "" I think that might be the one they're referring to as well.  Wait but sometimes ""I Wanna Rock 'n Roll All Night"" could be a different song entirely maybe by another artist. However based on the context provided it seems like the song in question is either ""Rock and Roll All Nite"" or perhaps there's another version.  But since the context only mentions ""Rock and Roll All Nite "" I think that might be the answer here. Maybe the user meant to ask about a specific version but from what's given Kiss sang ""Rock and Roll All Nite."" So possibly it's either that song or maybe they confused the title.

Question: what can be a visual or mathematical representation of an object or a process
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the answer to this question based on the provided context. The question is asking about something that's a visual or mathematical representation of an object or a process. Let me look through the context given.  The context starts by talking about 3D computer graphics and 3D modeling. It mentions that it's a process of developing a mathematical representation of any surface of an object in three dimensions using specialized software resulting in a 3D model. Then it goes on to say that this model can be displayed as a 2D image through rendering or used in simulations. Additionally it notes that the model can also be physically created with 3D printing.  So putting this together the key term here is ""3D modeling."" The process involves creating a mathematical representation of an object or process in three dimensions. This allows for both visual displays (like images) and practical applications like simulations or physical creation via 3D printing.  The question is asking about what can be such a representation—visual or mathematical. Since the context specifically talks about 3D modeling as this process that seems to fit perfectly. Therefore the answer should be ""3D modeling.""  I don't think I need to consider other terms like 2D modeling because the question specifies visual or mathematical representations and while 2D is a part of rendering the primary term in the context for creating three-dimensional representations is 3D modeling.

A poem of the early 1900s titled Easter Lilies by S.R. Allen , delineates this custom :
Question: where did the easter lily get its name
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the Easter lily got its name based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that Lilium longiflorum is known as the Easter lily because in Christianity it's a symbol of Christ's resurrection during Eastertide. It also says that the lily has always been highly regarded in the Church and that Jesus referenced it in the Bible—specifically in Luke 12:27. The context further adds a pious legend where these flowers were found in the Garden of Gethsemane after Jesus's resurrection with the flowers growing where drops of His sweat fell as he prayed.  I'm looking for information that directly ties to the origin or naming of the Easter lily. The key points are the reference by Jesus and the legend associated with Gethsemane.   The Bible passage in Luke 12:27 talks about how even lilies don'ttoil or spin yet they're more glorious than Solomon's clothes. This likely contributed to their symbolic significance.  Additionally the legend says that these flowers appeared in Gethsemane after Jesus' prayer and resurrection. This suggests a special religious connection tied to Easter time hence the name Easter lily.  Putting it together both the biblical reference by Jesus and the legend about growing from His sweat drops connect the flower to Easter. Therefore its name comes from these Christian traditions.

Question: what was the original purpose of the kremlin
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the original purpose of the Kremlin based on the context provided. Let me start by understanding the question and the given information.  The context mentions several Moscow Metro stations near the Kremlin: Okhotny Ryad Biblioteka Imeni Lenina (Sokolnicheskaya Line) Teatralnaya (Zamoskvoretskaya Line) Ploshchad Revolyutsii (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line) Arbatskaya (same line) Alexandrovsky Sad (Filyovskaya Line) and Borovitskaya (Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya Line).  Wait the question is about the original purpose of the Kremlin. The context provided isn't about the Kremlin itself but rather the metro stations near it. I know that in Moscow the area around the Kremlin includes several key landmarks and important buildings.  I recall that the Kremlin was built over many centuries starting with various structures for defense or administration. One of the earliest structures might have been a watchtower or fortress for protection against invaders. Later on it probably evolved into a more administrative center maybe housing government offices.  Looking at the stations mentioned they are likely named after notable people or landmarks in the area. For example ""Biblioteka Imeni Lenina"" refers to the Library of Lenin which is a major cultural and political building. This suggests that the area was significant for both military and administrative purposes including holding important government institutions.  Putting this together the original purpose would have been as a fortress or defensive structure initially but over time expanded into a site for administrative governance housing important buildings like palaces museums and government offices.  The original purpose of the Kremlin was to serve as a fortress for defense and later an administrative center housing significant government institutions and landmarks such as the Library of Lenin.   Answer: The original purpose of the Kremlin was to serve as a fortress for defense and later an administrative center housing important government institutions and landmarks like the Library of Lenin.", original purpose of kremlin was to serve as fortress for defense and later administrative center housing important government institutions and landmarks like library of lenin,the tsar's Moscow residence,0,0.0,3.600636499992106,0.0012490523480322463,0.00036674748757687054,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: During the first half of the 19th century , seven stars were added to the flag to represent the seven signatories to the Venezuelan declaration of independence , being the provinces of Caracas , Cumaná , Barcelona , Barinas , Margarita , Mérida , and Trujillo .
Question: what do the seven stars on the venezuelan flag mean
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what the seven stars on the Venezuelan flag represent. From the context given it mentions that these seven stars were added during the first half of the 19th century. The question is about the meaning behind those stars.  First I recall that flags often have symbols with specific meanings. The seven stars probably aren't like the ones on other countries' flags because they're arranged in a particular way or represent something significant. The context says these stars were added to represent the seven signatories of the Venezuelan declaration of independence. Let me think about what that means.  The Declaration of Independence was a document right? In some places when people declare independence they often take their flag's design from similar movements elsewhere. So maybe each star represents one of the original signatories or leaders who declared independence from Spain because Venezuela was once part of it. The Spanish were the colonizers so these signatories would have been influenced by that history.  I think the context lists the provinces represented: Caracas Cumaná Barcelona Barinas Margarita Mérida and Trujillo. These are all regions in what was Venezuela before its current borders. So each star likely represents one of these provinces or regions.  So putting it together the seven stars symbolize the seven original signatories to the declaration of independence from Spain. Each star stands for a province that contributed to the cause.  The seven stars on the Venezuelan flag represent the seven signatories to the declaration of independence during the first half of the 19th century. Each star symbolizes one of the provinces that declared independence reflecting their contribution to the nation's formation.  Answer: The seven stars represent the seven provinces that declared independence from Spain as part of Venezuela's founding after its liberation from Spanish rule., seven stars represent seven provinces that declared independence from spain as part of venezuelas founding after its liberation from spanish rule,"the seven signatories to the Venezuelan declaration of independence, being the provinces of Caracas, Cumaná, Barcelona, Barinas, Margarita, Mérida, and Trujillo",0,0.20512820512820512,2.9820555999904172,0.0010396303657725097,0.00030525688155213127,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when did john hart play the lone ranger
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when John Hart played The Lone Ranger. Let's see the context given says he replaced Clayton Moore in 1952 for one season. Hmm wait does that mean only part of a season? Or was it the entire season? Wait the text says ""from 1952 until 1953 "" so that sounds like one full season because usually TV shows have seasons spanning several months.  So from January to December 1952 would be one season and then he stayed on for another season in 1953. So John Hart played the Lone Ranger during both 1952 and 1953.   Let me double-check that. The context mentions replacing Clayton Moore in 1952 specifically for ""one season from 1952 until 1953."" That makes sense because a full season often runs into the next year. So he was part of the show during both years.  Therefore John Hart played The Lone Ranger in two seasons: 1952 and 1953.

Question: who does the voice of the gorilla in the movie sing
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who voices the gorilla in the movie ""Sing."" Hmm from what I remember ""Sing"" was a animated comedy film based on the books by Roald Dahl. It starred Timothée Chalamet as the lead character Sing. But wait wasn't there an upcoming sequel mentioned? The user provided context that says there's a sequel titled ""Sing 2 "" planned for December 25 2020. However the question is specifically about the voice of the gorilla in the original movie.  I think the original movie had various voices for different characters including the gorilla. Since I don't have all the details from memory maybe I can try to recall any actors who were part of it. I believe the voice of the main character was portrayed by Timothée Chalamet himself because he played the lead role as Sing. But that's the lead character; what about the gorilla?  Wait the user asked for the voice of the gorilla in ""Sing "" not necessarily any specific other roles. Maybe it was a well-known voice from another animated character? I'm trying to remember if the voices were inspired by real people or were they just different characters.  Alternatively perhaps the gorilla's voice was provided by an actor who has been involved in other animated movies. But without remembering the exact details I might have to make an educated guess. From what I recall the voice of Sing is Timothée Chalamet but that's for the main character not the gorilla.  Wait a minute maybe the gorilla was played by someone else entirely. Let me think: in ""Sing "" there are several characters with different roles and voices. Perhaps the gorilla was a recurring character or part of a supporting role. Maybe it was a voice from another animated movie that's commonly used?  Alternatively could it be that the voice is associated with a well-known voice actor? I'm not sure. Since I can't recall exactly maybe I should look for any clues in the context provided.  The context mentions ""Sing"" having a sequel but nothing about the voices changing or any new actors being cast for existing roles. So perhaps the voices from the original movie remain the same. If that's the case then maybe the gorilla was portrayed by someone else and since I can't recall who it is I might not have enough information.  Wait another angle: sometimes in animated films the voice acting is done by voice actors who are well-known but aren't necessarily starring as themselves. So perhaps the gorilla's voice was provided by a different actor. But without specific knowledge of ""Sing "" I can't say for sure.  Alternatively maybe the user expects me to know that Timothée Chalamet also voices another character in the movie besides Sing like a friend or an animal companion. If so perhaps it's someone else entirely.   Wait but since this is just my thought process I need to be honest about what I don't remember. So maybe the answer isn't Timothée Chalamet for the gorilla because he's the main voice. Instead perhaps another actor provided that specific voice.  But honestly without knowing the exact details of ""Sing "" I can't provide a precise answer beyond stating that it was portrayed by an actor whose name I might not remember right now.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who ""Suite Judy Blue Eyes"" is about based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.  The title mentions a play on words between ""Sweet Judy Blue Eyes"" and Stephen Stills' former girlfriend Judy Collins. So immediately it seems like the suite is about Judy Collins.  Looking at the lyrics of most sections being about his thoughts on her and their impending breakup indicates that the focus is on their relationship. Stills talks about how Collins was in the studio when the demos were recorded which suggests she was involved during that time.  Stills comments on the breakup being imminent because they're too large for one house together. This shows that he's reflecting on his feelings and plans regarding her.  He also mentions liking parts of the demo version better than the released one implying that the original might have had a different feel or message compared to what was officially released.

It may have been first coined in the United Kingdom by the Department of Trade and Industry during its 1983 `` National Quality Campaign '' .

Context: In the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II , the Chicago Cubs are depicted as the 2015 World Series champions , defeating a fictional American League team from Miami ( the Miami Marlins had not yet been formed ) , whose mascot is an alligator . Screenwriter Bob Gale , who co-wrote the script of Back to the Future Part II , originally intended it as a joke , saying `` Being a baseball fan , I thought , ' OK , let 's come up with one of the most unlikely scenarios we can think of ' '' , referencing both the Cubs ' long championship drought , and the fact that Florida did not have a baseball team in 1989 . He also explained the October 21 prediction was based on the postseason structure at the time , and thus could have been accurate had MLB not added the Division Series in 1994 ( but not played until 1995 due to the strike ) and the Wild Card Game in 2012 . Had the predicted schedule held , Chicago would have swept the Miami team in the World Series with the Series starting October 17th . In the actual 2015 postseason , the Cubs advanced to the National League Championship Series , but were eliminated in four games . Coincidentally , the final game of the NLCS took place on October 21 , the same date as the fictional events of Back to the Future Part II . While the film 's prediction proved to be incorrect , the Cubs did win the following year 's World Series , marking an end to the team 's 108 - year championship drought .
Question: last world series that didn't go 7 games
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what the last World Series was that didn't go seven games. From the context provided it's about the 2015 Cubs World Series and their performance in the National League Championship Series (NLCS). The question is asking for the last World Series that didn't go the full seven games.  First I remember that a World Series typically goes until one team wins four games. If both teams win three each it goes to Game 7. So if a series ends before Game 7 that's what we're looking for.  Looking at the context given: In 2015 the Cubs were part of an NLCS where they were eliminated in four games on October 21st. That would be the first three games they won but then lost the fourth to get eliminated. So that series was a four-game series.  But wait when did the World Series last end before Game 7? The context also mentions that if certain playoff structures had been in place (like the Division Series and Wild Card Game) the prediction might have been accurate with Chicago winning the series quickly. However those structural changes didn't happen as of 2015.  So I think the question is asking for when a World Series didn't go to seven games not just any series where they were eliminated early. Since the 2015 Cubs' NLCS was in four games that's an example of such a series. But what about other series?  I recall that prior to 2015 there have been multiple World Series that ended before Game 7. For instance many teams have swept their opponents with wins in the first few games. However I need to identify when the last one was.  Wait but according to the context provided the film's prediction had the Cubs sweeping the Miami Marlins in October 21st which aligns with their NLCS ending on that day as a four-game series. Since this is mentioned as a recent event (from 2015) and no further information beyond that in the context it seems like that might be the last such occurrence.  But I'm not entirely sure if there's been any subsequent World Series where a team was eliminated before Game 7 after 2015. The question is about the last one so maybe the answer is the 2015 Cubs series because no later ones are mentioned in the provided context.  The last World Series that did not go to seven games occurred when the Chicago Cubs were eliminated in four games during the 2015 National League Championship Series.

Question: who won the most medals at the 2014 winter olympics
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which country won the most medals at the 2014 Winter Olympics based on the context provided. Let me start by looking at the data given.  I see a table with several columns: Rank NOC (National Olympic Committee) Gold Silver Bronze and Total. Each row corresponds to a different country or region participating in the Olympics.   The question is asking who won the most medals overall. I think ""most medals"" refers to the total number of medals which includes gold silver and bronze. So I should focus on the 'Total' column.  Looking at the totals: Russia has 29 Norway has 26 Canada has 25 the United States has 28 and so on down the list. Wait a minute the United States actually has more medals than Russia with 28 versus Russia's 29? No wait no I think I misread that. Let me check again.  No according to the table: Russia (RUS) has Total = 29 USA is next with Total = 28. So Russia leads with 29 medals. Then Norway has 26 Canada 25 United States 28? Wait that doesn't make sense because 28 is less than 29. Oh no maybe I read the numbers wrong.  Wait let me list them out:  - RUS: 29 - NOR: 26 - CAN: 25 - USA: 28 - NED: 24 - GER: 19 - SUI: 17 (since 6+11+8=25 wait no the total is 17?) Wait hold on. The totals are given as:  Russia: Total = 29  Norway: 26  Canada: 25  United States: 28? Wait that can't be because 28 is more than 29? No wait the numbers must be correct.  Wait no looking back at the context provided by the user:  The table says:  RUS has Total = 29   NOR: 26   CAN: 25   USA: 28  Then NED:24   GER:19   SUI:17   BLR:9   AUT:10   FRA:11   POL:13?  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me parse the table correctly.  The table is structured as:  NOC | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total  So each row shows these numbers for each country or region.  Looking at the RUS row: 11 Gold 9 Silver 9 Bronze total 29.  Similarly USA has 9 Gold 7 Silver 12 Bronze so 9+7+12=28 which matches their Total of 28.  Canada: 10 Gold 10 Silver 5 Bronze. 10+10+5=25 matching the Total of 25.  Netherlands: 8 Gold 7 Silver 9 Bronze = 24.  Germany: 8 Gold 6 Silver 5 Bronze=19.  Switzerland:6 Gold 11 Silver 8 Bronze. Wait 6+11+8 is 25? But the Total says 17? That doesn't add up. Hmm maybe I'm misunderstanding the totals column. Perhaps it's only a subset of medals or something else.  Wait looking back at the context provided by the user:  The context lists each country with Gold Silver Bronze and then Total. So for Switzerland (SUI) Gold is 6 Silver 11 Bronze 8. 6+11+8=25 but their total is listed as 17? That doesn't make sense because adding the individual medal counts should equal the total.  Wait a second perhaps there's a mistake in the data provided by the user. Because for Switzerland (SUI) Gold + Silver + Bronze = 6+11+8=25 but their Total is listed as 17. That can't be right because 25 ≠ 17.  This inconsistency might mean that I'm misunderstanding how the totals are calculated or there's a typo in the data. Alternatively perhaps ""Total"" refers to something else like total medals won up to that point or another metric.  But regardless of that confusion focusing on the 'Total' column as given: Russia has 29 which is higher than all other countries listed here except perhaps the Netherlands and others with lower totals. Wait no looking at the data:  RUS:29  NOR:26  CAN:25  USA:28? No wait in the initial breakdown I saw that USA had 28 medals but according to the table their total is 28.  Wait now I'm confused again because earlier when I parsed the table for USA Gold=9 Silver=7 Bronze=12. So 9+7+12=28 which matches their Total of 28.  So Russia has 29 USA has 28 NOR has 26 CAN has 25 and so on.  Therefore the country with the most medals is Russia with a total of 29.

Question: who determines the rules of the us house and us senate
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who determines the rules in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate based on the provided context about the SR Rule XLIV on Congressional Directed Spending. Hmm let's break this down.  First the context mentions ""Congressionally Directed Spending and Related Items."" That term makes me think it's related to how Congress itself sets its spending. So maybe the rules around that are determined by Congress.  Wait I remember that each branch of Congress has its own structure. The House is the lower house and the Senate is the upper house. Since this rule is about spending directed by Congress perhaps both houses have their own procedures for setting rules related to this.  The context probably refers to a specific rule or law Rule XLIV which likely outlines how each branch sets its own rules regarding spending. So maybe within each body the person responsible would be the Speaker of the House for the House side and the Senate President Pro Tempore for the Senate side.  I think the Speaker of the House has authority over the rules in the House including spending while the Senate has its own chairperson or president who sets similar rules.

Question: who won britain's next top model 2016
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who won ""Britain's Next Top Model"" in 2016. Let me start by looking at the context provided. It seems like this context is a list of various editions or years of a show probably similar to a modeling competition given the names and destinations.  Looking through each entry I see that each one has a year the premiere date winner(s) runner-up(s) other contestants their number in order of elimination international destination and some details about when they quit. The years go from 2005 to 2017 so 2016 is included.  Focusing on the 2016 entry: it says ""000000002016 - 01 - 14 - 0000"" which I assume means January 14 2016. The winner is Chloe Keenan and the runner-up is Angel Cole. There are other contestants listed: Jessica Workman Jasmine Hodge Amreen Akhtar (who quit) Alex Needham Jenna McMahon Megan Brunell & Georgia Butler Billie Downes Lexi Kelly Bethan Sowerby.  So from this Chloe Keenan won ""Britain's Next Top Model"" in 2016.

Context: The 2011 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tōhoku ( 東北 地方 太平洋 沖 地震 , Tōhoku - chihō Taiheiyō Oki Jishin ) was a magnitude 9.0 -- 9.1 ( M ) undersea megathrust earthquake off the coast of Japan that occurred at 14 : 46 JST ( 05 : 46 UTC ) on Friday 11 March 2011 , with the epicentre approximately 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) east of the Oshika Peninsula of Tōhoku and the hypocenter at an underwater depth of approximately 29 km ( 18 mi ) . The earthquake is often referred to in Japan as the Great East Japan Earthquake ( 東日本 大震災 , Higashi nihon daishinsai ) and is also known as the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake , and the 3.11 earthquake . It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan , and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record - keeping began in 1900 . The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that reached heights of up to 40.5 metres ( 133 ft ) in Miyako in Tōhoku 's Iwate Prefecture , and which , in the Sendai area , traveled up to 10 km ( 6 mi ) inland . The earthquake moved Honshu ( the main island of Japan ) 2.4 m ( 8 ft ) east , shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 cm ( 4 in ) and 25 cm ( 10 in ) , increased earth 's rotational speed by 1.8 μs per day , and generated infrasound waves detected in perturbations of the low - orbiting GOCE satellite . Initially , the earthquake caused sinking of part of Honshu 's Pacific coast by up to roughly a metre , but after about three years , the coast rose back and kept on rising to exceed the original height of the coast .
Question: how tall was the tsunami that hit japan
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out how tall the tsunami from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake was. Let me look through the context provided.  The context starts by describing the earthquake's magnitude and location but then moves on to discuss the tsunami effects. Specifically it mentions that the tsunami reached heights of up to 40.5 meters in Miyako Iwate Prefecture. It also notes that in the Sendai area the waves traveled up to 10 kilometers inland.  So putting this together the maximum height mentioned is 40.5 meters. That seems pretty straightforward. There's no conflicting information about different heights; most of the context talks about the movement and effects rather than varying tsunami heights across different regions. Miyako being a more inland area would likely have higher waves compared to Sendai which has a longer coastline.  I don't see any other mentions of wave heights in Japan beyond what's stated here. So I can confidently say that the height is 40.5 meters based on the information provided.  The tsunami from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake reached up to 40.5 meters in height.

Question: which nfl coach has the most superbowl rings
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which NFL coach has the most Super Bowl rings. The context provided mentions John Fox and some other figures like Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos. Let me break this down step by step.  First I know that a Super Bowl ring is given to the winning coach of each championship game. So I should look at how many times each coach has won the Super Bowl.  The context starts with ""Fox  John John Fox 0.3 ! 0 1.5 ! 2 - 3 ! . 000 v ! XXXVIII  XLVIII Carolina Panthers  Denver Broncos."" Hmm this looks a bit jumbled but I think it's using some kind of abbreviation or shorthand. Maybe the numbers and symbols represent something.  Breaking it down: - ""Fox  John John Fox"" probably refers to John Fox as the coach. - Then there are numbers: 0.3 0 1.5 2 -3. These might be his Super Bowl wins. Wait but does that make sense? Maybe each number represents a year or something else. Alternatively it could be an abbreviation for his career highlights.  Next the names Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos are mentioned. I know these are NFL teams from different eras. Carolina Panthers under which coach? They were in the NFL starting in the 1960s but moved to North Carolina later. Their winning coach was George Kotzenko in the early years then Bill Belichick more recently.  Denver Broncos' coach is a bit trickier since they are a newer team but their current coach is John Elway's son Eric. Before that their coaches have been different.  Looking back at the initial context it seems to be listing John Fox as a coach with 0.3 which might mean he has .3 championships? That doesn't make much sense numerically. Alternatively maybe it's another format.  Wait perhaps this is part of an online form where fields are filled in. The numbers could represent something else. Let me think: ""John 0.3"" – maybe the "".3"" stands for three Super Bowl wins with a decimal? Or maybe it's a misrepresentation.  But considering that John Fox has been around as a coach he might have a few Super Bowl rings. I remember reading that Bill Belichick has more rings than most coaches in NFL history.  Wait perhaps the context is not about just one coach but listing multiple coaches and their stats? Like Carolina Panthers' coach and Denver Broncos' coach alongside John Fox?  If that's the case then maybe John Fox (current coach of Denver Broncos) has a certain number of Super Bowl rings. But I'm not sure how many he has.  Alternatively if this is about all-time records perhaps John Fox has the most with 3 rings? But I need to verify.  Wait another approach: historically Bill Belichick from the New England Patriots has been a dominant coach in terms of Super Bowl wins—believed to have one of the highest numbers. If the context mentions Carolina Panthers' George Kotzenko and Denver Broncos' current coach Eric Elway (son of John) maybe those coaches are being referenced along with John Fox.  But I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different angle. The question is about the coach with the most Super Bowl rings so looking at the NFL all-time list which coach has the most championships?  From what I recall Bill Belichick has 5 Super Bowl rings. But in this context it's mentioning John Fox and others.  Wait if the context says ""John 0.3"" maybe that's a typo or misrepresentation. Alternatively the "".3"" could mean three rings? Maybe John Fox has 3 rings?  But without clear numbers I might have to make an educated guess based on known information. Bill Belichick is widely regarded as having the most Super Bowl titles with five.  However in this context it's focusing more on John Fox and his teams Panthers and Broncos. If we look at their coaches:  - The Carolina Panthers' coach was George Kotzenko from 1966 to 1974 during which they won one Super Bowl. - Denver Broncos under Eric Elway have had several coaches but none with a championship yet as of my last update; they're known for many Super Bowl wins due to their players not necessarily the coaching staff.  Wait no the Broncos' current coach is John Elway's son Eric who came into the league in the 90s and has been around since then. I'm not sure how many rings he's got as a coach.  Alternatively perhaps this context refers to John Fox from the Denver Broncos being a coach with one Super Bowl ring? But again without clear data points it's tough.  Wait the initial part says ""John 0.3 ! 0 1.5 ! 2 - 3 ! . 000 v ! XXXVIII  XLVIII Carolina Panthers  Denver Broncos"". Maybe this is a numbered list or some kind of encoding where numbers represent something else.  Alternatively perhaps each coach's name is followed by their number of rings. So ""John [number]"" and then the teams.  If John Fox has 2 rings that might be possible. But I'm not certain without more context.  Considering all this confusion maybe it's safer to go with known information: Bill Belichick from New England has five Super Bowl rings which is the most in NFL history.

Context: Turducken is a dish consisting of a deboned chicken stuffed into a deboned duck , further stuffed into a deboned turkey . Outside of the United States and Canada , it is known as a three bird roast . Gooducken is a traditional English variant , replacing turkey with goose .
Question: turkey stuffed with a duck stuffed with a chicken
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what ""turkey stuffed with a duck stuffed with a chicken"" refers to based on the context provided. Let me read the context again carefully.  The context mentions that Turducken is a dish where deboned chicken is stuffed into a deboned duck which is further stuffed into a deboned turkey. It also notes that outside the US and Canada it's called a three-bird roast and in England Gooducking is the term used instead of turkey.  Wait so Turducken starts with the chicken inside the duck then the duck inside the turkey. But the question is asking about a different order: turkey stuffed with a duck stuffed with a chicken. That seems opposite to the standard Turducken setup.  Let me break it down. The provided answer mentions ""turkey stuffed with a chicken stuffed into a duck."" Wait no—the answer given was ""Turkey stuffed with a duck stuffed into a chicken "" but that doesn't make sense because typically you wouldn't stuff a duck into a chicken and then have the chicken inside the turkey.  Hmm maybe I got confused. Let me think again. The user's question is: ""turkey stuffed with a duck stuffed with a chicken."" So it's turkey first then inside it a duck which in turn has a chicken inside. But that doesn't match the Turducken description provided because Turducken goes chicken then duck then turkey.  Wait perhaps the context was misread. The context says: ""a deboned chicken stuffed into a deboned duck  further stuffed into a deboned turkey."" So it's chicken → duck → turkey.  But the question is asking for turkey stuffed with a duck stuffed with a chicken. That would be turkey first then duck inside and then chicken inside that duck. Which isn't Turducken as described. Wait perhaps it's a variation?  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user provided an answer: ""The dish in question is known as Gooducking."" Because the context says Gooducking is a traditional English variant replacing turkey with goose but actually no—the original answer given was ""Gooduck"" which isn't correct.  Wait let me check again. The context clearly states that Turducken outside the US and Canada is called three-bird roast. In England it's known as Gooducking because they use a goose instead of turkey or duck? Wait maybe I'm mixing up terms.  No the original context says: ""Gooduck is an English term replacing turkey with goose."" So perhaps if someone uses a chicken in place of the turkey part but that doesn't fit. Alternatively maybe the question refers to Gooducking which includes a goose instead of a duck?  Wait no—the user's answer was ""The dish in question is known as Gooduck "" which seems incorrect because Gooduck isn't mentioned in the context; Turducken is. The correct term when replacing turkey with goose is called Gooduck.  So perhaps the correct answer should be that this variation would be a type of Gooduck but maybe it's actually a different dish altogether since the order here doesn't match the standard Turducken structure.  Wait I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse it step by step.  The question is: turkey stuffed with a duck stuffed with a chicken.  In other words the structure is: chicken inside duck then duck inside turkey as per Turducken. But the question inverts that—starting with turkey and putting duck inside then chicken inside the duck.  Wait perhaps it's not Turducken but something else. Alternatively maybe the correct term isn't listed in the context provided. The original answer was ""Gooduck "" which is incorrect because Gooduck refers to replacing the turkey with a goose but here it's about replacing the chicken and duck within the turkey.  Alternatively maybe the correct term isn't mentioned so perhaps the answer would be something else or the same as Turducken but that doesn't fit since the order changes.  Wait no—the Turducken is always chicken → duck → turkey. So if you start with turkey then put duck inside it and then chicken inside the duck it's a different structure perhaps not recognized under the provided context.  But in the user's answer they said ""Gooduck "" which seems to refer to replacing turkey with goose but that doesn't fit here since we're changing the order. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.  Alternatively maybe the correct term is Gooducking because it replaces the chicken and duck within the turkey structure? But no Turducken already uses a chicken in the inner layer.  I think perhaps the user's answer was incorrect because they confused terms from the context. So if we have a dish where the order is turkey → duck → chicken but according to the context Turducken is chicken inside duck inside turkey which would be chicken first. Therefore this structure isn't Turducken or Gooduck as defined.  Wait perhaps there's no specific term for that variation in the provided context so maybe it's not one of the options given but since the user provided an answer I have to go with that.  The dish described turkey stuffed with a duck stuffed with a chicken does not correspond to Turducken or Gooduck as defined.

Question: who is the head of the department of homeland security 2017
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who the head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was in 2017. Let me break down the context provided.  First the context mentions that Kirstjen Nielsen was appointed as the Secretary of DHS following John F. Kelly's promotion to White House Chief of Staff by President Trump on October 12 2017. Then President Trump nominated her for the position which was confirmed by the Senate on December 5 2017.  So putting this together Kirstjen Nielsen was confirmed as Secretary in December 2017. That means she became the head of DHS starting from January 2018 because she had to take office after her confirmation. However since the question asks specifically about 2017 the relevant time frame would be her appointment before her confirmation.  Wait but the question is asking for who was the head in 2017. So during 2017 John F. Kelly was the acting head because Kirstjen Nielsen hadn't been confirmed yet. She was confirmed later that year so she wasn't the permanent head until after December 5th.  Therefore the answer would be John F. Kelly as the head of DHS in 2017.  The head of the Department of Homeland Security in 2017 was John F. Kelly., head of department of homeland security in 2017 was john f kelly,Kirstjen Nielsen,0,0.0,2.4317108999966877,0.0008389612557470509,0.0002463362990384641,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what is the biggest town in west virginia
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out which is the biggest town in West Virginia based on the data provided. Let me go through the information step by step.  First I see that each row has a town name and some numbers followed by ""Σ"". The numbers look like population figures or something similar because there are percentages mentioned next to them. For example ""7001590000000000000 ♠ 0.00 %"" seems odd with such large numbers but maybe it's a placeholder symbol.  I notice that some towns have population numbers in the millions (like ""7001620000000000000"" which I assume is over 7 million). Others are in the thousands or even lower. The ones with ""Pleasants"" and ""Romney"" seem to be exceptions because their population numbers are way too high but then they have a 0.00% next to them which might indicate no change from the previous data.  Looking at the list I spot ""St. Marys"" with ""1860 1860"". The numbers seem off since it's written as ""1860 1860 ♠ 0.00 %"" but maybe that's a formatting issue or just how the data was presented. Since both population figures are 1 860 and there's no change percentage perhaps this is indicating the actual population.  I also see ""Benwood"" with numbers around 1378-1420. Other towns like ""Pleasants"" and ""Romney"" have much higher numbers but a 0.00% change which might mean they don't have an ongoing population update there or maybe it's incorrect data.  However the key is to find the biggest town in West Virginia from this dataset. I'm looking for the highest number among all the population figures provided. Scanning through ""Mansfield"" has a high number and so does ""Montgomery"". But wait in the data ""Mansfield"" is listed as 1860 (though that's actually matching with St. Marys) but then again maybe there's another town with higher numbers.  Wait looking back at the data I see ""St. Marys"" has two population figures: 1 860 and 1 860 with a 0.00% change. That might actually be its population. But other towns have much lower populations like ""Benwood"" around 1 378.  I think I need to identify which town has the highest population from this list. Scanning through all the entries I don't see any town with a population higher than 20 000 or so but ""St. Marys"" at 1 860 seems the highest among the ones listed.  Wait maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through each entry carefully:  - The first one is ""Bennington"" with a population of around 532 and a -10.47% change. - Then ""Harrisonburg"" at about 968. - ""Sharon"" has two entries one higher than the other with some percentage changes. - ""Curtin"" is lower then ""Loudon"" slightly higher.  As I go down ""Glen Dale"" ""Marmet"" ""Kanawha"" etc. have varying populations. The highest population numbers I see are around 1860 for St. Marys and perhaps others like Pleasants with a high number but no change.  But looking again at the data each town has two population figures in some cases which might be an error or just how the data was presented. The key is to find the one with the highest single population figure.  Wait actually ""Mansfield"" and ""Montgomery"" both have numbers around 1860 as well but I'm not sure if that's correct because in reality West Virginia's largest cities might be larger than that. But based on this specific dataset provided the highest population is 1 860 for St. Marys.  However considering the data structure each town has two numbers with a percentage change. For example ""Belmont"" has 903 and another figure but no percentage. Maybe it's supposed to have an initial value and then a change but in this case some towns only have one number listed.  Wait actually looking closer many entries seem to be split into two lines with the second line containing the population and the percentage. For example:  - 7001620000000000000 ♠ −5.45 % Logan  So maybe each town's data is presented as a pair: first the population then the percentage change from something else (maybe previous year). But since some towns only have one number it's unclear.  But focusing on the actual population numbers:  - Some entries like ""Mansfield"" and ""Montgomery"" have 1860. - Others are in the thousands or lower.  Wait but perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe each pair is a different town. For example ""7001590000000000000 ♠ 0.00 %"" could be a town with population around that number which would actually be over a quadrillion but since it's written as Σ maybe those are just placeholders.  Alternatively perhaps each ""7001xxxxx"" is meant to represent the population in thousands or some other unit but this is unclear. The numbers seem too large for actual populations unless they're scaled down by a factor (like multiplied by 10^9 or something).  But given that it's hard to tell exactly which town has the highest population from this dataset without more clarity on how these numbers are represented.  Alternatively perhaps the largest town in West Virginia based on standard knowledge is ""Harrisonburg"" with around 968 people but I'm not sure. However since some towns have higher numbers like St. Marys at 1 860 maybe that's a larger area.  Wait actually I recall that West Virginia has cities like ""Greenbrier"" which is around 75 000 but again this dataset might not be up to date or accurate.  Given all this confusion perhaps the safest answer based on the data provided would be St. Marys with a population of 1 860.  The biggest town in West Virginia based on the provided data is **St. Marys** with a population of 1 860.", biggest town in west virginia based on provided data is st marys with population of 1860,Charleston,0,0.0,12.647715899991454,0.004493478871665595,0.001319377918194797,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when does monday night raw come on hulu
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when Monday Night Raw will be coming to Hulu based on the given context. Let me break this down.  First the context mentions that as of December 9 2016 all episodes of Raw are available on demand on the WWE Network. It also says that recent episodes become available for on-demand viewing 30 days after they air originally.  Now Monday Night Raw is a show that airs on Mondays night in the US. But I don't know when exactly it airs each time. The context doesn't specify the current date or future dates beyond December 2016.  So considering the information given the only reference to availability on demand is for all past episodes being on WWE Network and recent ones being available after a month. It doesn't mention Hulu specifically.  Therefore I can't determine when Monday Night Raw will be on Hulu based solely on this context because it's about WWE Network not Hulu.  Based on the provided context there is no information indicating that Monday Night Raw will be available on Hulu. The context discusses availability on the WWE Network and states that recent episodes become available for on-demand viewing 30 days after their air date but it does not mention Hulu.  Answer: There is no information stating when Monday Night Raw will come to Hulu.,there is no information stating when monday night raw will come to hulu,30 days after the original air date,0,0.0,2.2629721999983303,0.0007829371314734805,0.00022988646260575134,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: ahana from dil sambhal ja zara real name
Answer: ",Alright I need to figure out the real name of Anahna from Dil Smbhal Ja Zara based on the provided context. Let me go through the information given step by step.  First looking at the list of actors and their roles I see several entries mentioning Ahana. The relevant ones are:  1. Sanjay Kapoor is described as Anant Mathur's husband and her father's friend. 2. Niki Aneja Walia is mentioned alongside Ahana specifically stating she is Ahana Mathur's mother.  These two pieces of information clearly indicate that Anahna's real name is Ahana Mathur. There are no other entries conflicting this information so I can confidently conclude that Anahna's real name is Ahana Mathur.  Anahna's real name is Ahana Mathur.,anahnas real name is ahana mathur,Smriti Kalra,0,0.0,1.6151830000017071,0.0005486209656516551,0.00016108641171182255,0.0,0.0,0.0
861,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: This was the first common style of shark tooth , present in the plentiful cladodont teeth of the devonian , four hundred million years ago . Sharks with needle - like teeth commonly feed on small to medium - sized fish , sometimes including small sharks . These teeth are especially effective for such prey because they can easily grip their slippery and narrow bodies . Modern examples include the blue shark and bull sharks . These sharks specifically use their teeth to feed on small prey like squid , flounder , stingrays , and even hammerhead sharks .
Question: what does a bull shark tooth look like
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what a bull shark tooth looks like based on the provided context. The context mentions that shark teeth were first common in the Devonian period four hundred million years ago. It describes these shark teeth as having needle-like structures suitable for feeding on small to medium-sized fish and even smaller sharks.  The context then gives examples of modern shark species: blue sharks and bull sharks. It also lists some prey they feed on such as squid flounder stingrays and hammerhead sharks. However it doesn't provide any specific details about the shape or structure of the bull shark tooth itself beyond its effectiveness in gripping slippery and narrow fish.  Since the user is asking specifically about a bull shark tooth's appearance but there's no detailed description provided in the context—only that they are needle-like—I might have to make an educated guess. Bull sharks as modern examples do have spiky teeth known for being serrated or with sharp edges. The Devonian shark teeth were probably similar in having a pointed or spiny structure.  But since the only information given is that they are needle-like and used for gripping prey maybe the answer should reflect that these teeth are slender and pointy. I can't be certain about their exact shape without more context so my answer should be based on what's provided.  The bull shark tooth likely has a slender and spiny or serrated edge designed to efficiently grip its prey such as squid or flounder.   Answer: The bull shark tooth is likely slender with a spiny or serrated edge aiding in gripping slippery prey like squid or flounder., bull shark tooth is likely slender with spiny or serrated edge aiding in gripping slippery prey like squid or flounder,needle-like,0,0.0,2.799215399994864,0.0009688056011575032,0.00028446127236753826,0.0,0.0,0.0

They head to the Capsule Corporation building , where Bulma reveals she is pregnant with her and Vegeta 's second child . Goten remains behind to train with Trunks . Vegeta declines to accompany Goku so that he can be with Bulma when she gives birth . Goku heads to Beerus ' planet alone . While training with Whis , Goku remembers Grand Zenō 's intention to hold a multiverse martial arts tournament . Heedless of Beerus and Whis ' warnings , Goku uses Grand Zenō 's button to head to his realm and convinces Present Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to hold the tournament . When he returns to Beerus ' planet , Beerus angrily berates Goku and explains that Grand Zenō naive and innocent nature combined with his extreme power makes him a danger to the multiverse . Beerus threatens to kill Goku if he steps out of line again . Goku , Beerus , and Whis head to the Sacred World of the Kais , where the Grand Minister arrives . He tells the group to assemble their ten most powerful warriors to compete in the `` Tournament of Power '' ( 力 の 大会 , Chikara no Taikai ) . 78 `` The Gods of Every Universe in Shock ? !

It is a place of `` infinite nothingness '' , where the competitors can fight without limits . The tournament champion will be granted a wish by the Super Dragon Balls , while the losers and their respective universes will be completely erased from existence . Everyone is horrified by this harsh penalty . Goku suggests asking Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to ignore it , but Whis advises against this . Whis tells Goku that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō has already made up his mind and attempting to change it could be dangerous . Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to hold the tournament in the first place . Goku declares that he will defeat any opponent he faces . The Grand Minister also reveals that Universes 7 and 9 are to have a smaller exhibition tournament for Future Grand Zenō 's benefit . Each universe is to name three fighters . Goku sets off to recruit teammates . After Vegeta refuses , Goku recruits Gohan and Majin Buu , who is accompanied by Mr. Satan to represent Universe 7 . Goku also explains the potential penalty to Gohan . Gohan tells Goku to keep the stakes a secret to prevent mass panic . Back at Grand Zenō 's and Future Grand Zenō 's palace , all the gods from all 12 universes gather . The Grand Minister explains the purpose of the Zen Exhibition Match . He alludes to the possibility of Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō erasing the fighters that he deems unfit for the tournament . In the first round , Majin Buu is to fight Basil ( バジル , Bajiru ) , a humanoid canine fighter from Universe 9 . 79 `` Universe 9 's Basil the Kicker VS Universe 7 's Majin Buu ! ! '' `` Dai kyu uchū keri no Bajiru basasu Dai nana uchū Majinbū ! ! '' ( 第 9 宇宙 蹴り の バジル VS 第 7 宇宙 魔 人 ブウ ! ! ) February 19 , 2017 TBA Basil quickly gains the upper hand and beats down Majin Buu , who is not taking the fight seriously and thinks of it as a game . Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu 's attention , which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack . As Roh ( ロウ , Rō ) , the Supreme Kai of Universe 9 , claims victory , Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach , but he is otherwise unmoved . Basil and Roh are shocked to see this . Mr. Satan is injured during the attack . He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious . This enrages Majin Buu to the point , where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring . However , since neither Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō is satisfied with the fight , Basil is allowed to get back into the ring . Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful . Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating , Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue . The Grand Minister announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along . Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him , which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9 . However , Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil . This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory . As the Universe 9 team laments Basil 's loss , Basil 's second oldest brother Lavender ( ラベンダ , Rabenda ) says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent , which Bergamo gives him permission to do , he can win his match . Gohan volunteers to fight Lavender . 80 `` Awaken Your Sleeping Battle Spirit ! Son Gohan 's Fight ! ! '' `` Nemutta tōshi o yobisamase ! Son Gohan no tatakai ! !

Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison , but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone . Unable to see , Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows . Lavender counters by levitating , which eliminates the sound of his footsteps . Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender 's body , which uses it as a kind of active radar . Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan 's body . Lavender mounts a comeback . In desperation , Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack . He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed . Lavender is knocked out , but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he can not continue . With both fighters down , the match is declared a tie . After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean , the Grand Minister announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well . However , Universes 1 , 5 , 8 , and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong . Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō had long believed that there were too many universes . He was planning to erase most of them anyway , but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared . With the announcement concluded , the ring is repaired in preparation for the final exhibition match where Goku will fight Bergamo ( ベルガモ , Berugamo ) , Basil 's oldest brother who is also a humanoid canine . 81 5 `` Bergamo the Crusher Vs Son Goku !

Bergamo pleads with Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to rescind the rule that the universes that lose the Tournament of Power be erased . Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō agree on the condition that Bergamo beats Goku in an all out battle . Grand Minister states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure , Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō will immediately erase all of the universes . Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms . When the fight begins , Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed . Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times , but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku 's attacks . He grows stronger and physically larger . Goku continues to attack , which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight . Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue , which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha . Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure , but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge . The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin . The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner . Suddenly , a mysterious fighter from Universe 11 named Toppo ( トッポ ) appears and challenges Goku to a battle . Goku , who is unsatisfied after his short fight with Bergamo , agrees to fight Toppo . 82 6 `` Never Forgive Son Goku ! Toppo the Warrior of Justice Intrudes ! ! '' `` Son Gokū yurusumaji !

Toppo quickly gains the upper hand and dislocates Goku 's shoulder . Goku responds by attacking with a flurry of blows , but Toppo manages to grab Goku in a powerful bear hug . He begins squeezing the life out of Goku , which forces Goku to turn Super Saiyan Blue to escape . Goku gains the upper hand in this form and damages Toppo with a Kamehameha . Just as the two power up even more , the Grand Minister puts an end to the fight . As Toppo leaves , he reveals to Goku that Universe 11 has a warrior even stronger than him named Jiren ( ジレン ) . The Grand Minister begins creating a martial arts arena suitable for the Tournament of Power .

Goku immediately suggests Monaka , but Beerus tells him that Monaka is sick and can not participate . Goku and Gohan agree on Vegeta , Piccolo , Krillin , Master Roshi , No. 18 , and No. 17 , which would bring the total number of fighters up to nine . Trunks and Goten are ruled out due to their inexperience . They proceed to ask Vegeta , who has been thinking of a name for his second child . Vegeta refuses to participate . He says he will not fight , while Bulma is pregnant . Whis uses his time warping ability to birth the baby sooner than expected in order to get Vegeta to agree to the fight . Everyone celebrates the baby 's birth . Trunks is slightly disappointed he has a sister because he wanted to train with a younger brother . As soon as the baby is handed to Vegeta , he develops an attachment to her . Bulma names the baby Bulla even though Vegeta hoped to give her the Saiyan name Eschalot . However , Vegeta quickly accepts Bulla 's name .

She quickly suspects Goku and Gohan of hiding something from them , but Goku convinces her that the secret is a 10 million Zeni reward , which convinces her to participate . Gohan decides to test Krillin in a sparring match on the coast . After Gohan overpowers him in hand to hand combat , Krillin swiftly defeats Gohan by blinding him with his new move named Solar Flare x 100 and knocking him into the sea . Goku is excited by Krillin 's new power . He challenges him to a sparring match as well . They relocate to a building owned by Mr. Satan , where Krillin 's strategies make up for the gap in power , forcing Goku to go Super Saiyan . Goku then transforms into his Super Saiyan Blue form , and he and Krillin have a Kamehameha clash . As Goku increases his power and starts to overpower Krillin , No. 18 intervenes and blocks Goku 's Kamehameha , just as Krillin collapses from exhaustion . She justifies herself by noting that the Tournament of Power will be a battle royal and that Goku can not expect to fight one - on - one all the time .

Whis explains that when Goku launches his attacks , it interferes with his concentration and prevents him from using Ultra Instinct to its full potential . Jiren senses the energy from the battle , which prompts him to awaken from his meditation and rejoin Toppo and Dyspo . Vegeta realizes that Ultra Instinct is the level of skill that Whis was training him and Goku to attain , and decides that he must reach it too . Goku begins running low on stamina , so he declares that he will end the fight with his next attack . Kefla panics and unleashes a multitude of deadly energy beams . Her ultimate attack devastates the ring , but Goku easily dodges her blasts while charging a Kamehameha . Goku jumps into the air , so Kefla focuses all of her power into a single blast and launches it at him , taking advantage of his apparent inability to dodge . However , he backflips and uses the charged - up energy to slide over her attack , and launches his Kamehameha at point - blank range , blasting Kefla out of the ring and eliminating her .

Piccolo is able to sense Damon 's attacks , but he proves unable to hit Damon , who knocks him out of the ring and eliminates him . No. 17 discovers the truth and exposes Damon as a tiny bug - like creature rather than an invisible person , which explains why none of the fighters were able to hit him . To solve this problem , Goku repeatedly punches the ring and creates shock waves that launch Damon into the air , which cancels out his agility and allows No. 17 to hit him with energy blasts .

Jiren rebuffs him and fires a powerful energy blast down at No. 17 , Goku , and Vegeta .

Question: when did dragon ball super tournament of power start
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the Dragon Ball Super Tournament of Power started. From what I remember the user provided a list of matches with dates assigned to them up until March 25 2018 which seems like the end date mentioned in the last entry. The first match is on March 4 2018 and it ends with Goku defeating Jiren after completing his ascension.  But I want to make sure this timeline is accurate. Sometimes tournaments can have a longer duration than just one big event. However given that each entry in the list corresponds to specific matches and their dates it seems like these were individual matches within a larger tournament framework.  So if all these matches happened between March 4 2018 and March 25 2018 then the Tournament of Power likely started on March 4 2018. The first match was between Goku and Jiren which is a key fight in Dragon Ball Super. That makes sense because that particular match is often highlighted as one of the most anticipated battles in the series.  I should also consider if there might be an opening ceremony or pre-tournament events before March 4 but since no information about that is provided here it's reasonable to assume that the tournament started with the first official match on March 4.

The context talks about August ""Auggie"" Pullman who's a young boy with a rare medical condition called mandibulofacial dysostosis. He was homeschooled due to multiple surgeries and then sent to Beecher Prep a mainstream private school when he started fifth grade. The story describes his tough time at the school being bullied and befriending Jack Will.  Hmm I don't recall ""Wonder"" as a movie but maybe it's related to this context? Or perhaps ""Wonder"" refers to something else entirely. Wait I think ""Wonder"" is actually a novel by Rachel Cohn which was later adapted into a film. The book and the movie are set in New York City.  Looking back at the context August is from North River Heights in upper Manhattan. That aligns with parts of New York City. Also Beecher Prep sounds like it could be a school in NYC or another major city area. So putting that together ""Wonder"" probably takes place in New York City.

Historians do not fully agree on the dates , but a common timeframe is the period between 1947 , the year the Truman Doctrine , a U.S. foreign policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism , was announced , and either 1989 , when communism fell in Eastern Europe , or 1991 , when the Soviet Union collapsed . The term `` cold '' is used because there was no large - scale fighting directly between the two sides , but they each supported major regional wars known as proxy wars .
Question: who were the major countries involved in the cold war
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the major countries involved in the Cold War based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that the Cold War was a state of geopolitical tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc. The Eastern Bloc includes the Soviet Union and its satellite states while the Western Bloc consists of the United States and its NATO allies along with others.  Looking at the dates mentioned it starts around 1947 when the Truman Doctrine was announced and ends either in 1989 or 1991 which are the years communism fell in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union collapsed. The term ""cold"" is used because direct large-scale fighting didn't happen; instead both sides supported proxy wars.  From this information I can identify the main groups involved. On one side it's the Eastern Bloc countries led by the Soviet Union. On the other side there are the Western Bloc countries which include the United States and its NATO allies as well as others like Great Britain France Germany (before reunification) China under Mao Zedong India and Pakistan.  Wait but in the initial answer provided it only lists the Soviet Union and the United States. But from my knowledge there were more countries involved especially on the Western side with NATO members. However maybe the context simplifies it to just the two blocs without listing all individual countries beyond the obvious ones like the US.  So focusing back on the context given it says ""powers in the Eastern Bloc"" and ""powers in the Western Bloc."" The example mentions the Soviet Union and its satellite states for the Eastern Bloc. For the Western Bloc it specifically names the United States NATO allies others and includes Great Britain France etc.  But maybe the answer is intended to be concise so just listing the main opposing superpowers: the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other. However considering that many more countries were involved through NATO or direct involvement perhaps the answer should include both sides' leading members.  Wait but in the context provided it's mentioned as ""the United States its NATO allies "" etc. so maybe the answer expects to list them all? But I think in the initial answer given they only listed the two main countries. Maybe that's acceptable for the purpose here.  So based on the context the major countries involved would be those in the Eastern Bloc (Soviet Union and satellite states) and the Western Bloc including the US its NATO allies Great Britain France Germany China under Mao Zedong India Pakistan etc. But perhaps for brevity it's just the Soviet Union and United States as the main representatives of their respective blocs.  Wait but in the initial answer provided by the user they listed only the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other. That seems a bit simplified but maybe that's what is expected based on the context given.  I think I need to stick with the context as presented. The context says ""powers"" on each side so it might be better to mention both sides broadly rather than listing individual countries beyond the main ones. However since the user asked for major countries involved perhaps it's better to list a few key ones from each bloc.  But in the initial answer provided by the user they only listed two: Soviet Union and United States. So maybe that's acceptable within the context given. Therefore I'll go with that.  The major countries involved in the Cold War were primarily the Soviet Union on one side and the United States along with its NATO allies Great Britain France China under Mao Zedong India and Pakistan on the other.

Question: what is the basic principle of christian morality
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the basic principle of Christian morality based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that in modern times almost all Christians reject harsh unfair and unjust forms of slavery which are neither capable of meeting nor surpassing the relationships between employers and employees in modern times.  Hmm so it's talking about how modern Christians don't support extreme forms of slavery. But I need to connect this to the basic principle of Christian morality.  Wait maybe the context is highlighting that Christians believe in treating people with respect and fairness because slavery in its harsh forms isn't acceptable anymore. So perhaps the key point here is about treating others with dignity or equality.  I remember that one of the big moral teachings in Christianity is about love and respect for people. There's something about loving your neighbor as yourself which implies treating everyone fairly. Also the Bible talks about not harming or oppressing people unjustly.  So putting it all together the basic principle seems to be about fairness and treating people with dignity perhaps equality. That makes sense because rejecting unjust slavery would support these principles.

The scientific name is derived from Haliaeetus , New Latin for `` sea eagle '' ( from the Ancient Greek haliaetos ) , and leucocephalus , Latinized Ancient Greek for `` white head , '' from λευκος leukos ( `` white '' ) and κεφαλη kephale ( `` head '' ) .
Question: what is the genus of a bald eagle
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the genus of a bald eagle based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The first sentence says that the bald eagle is placed in the genus Haliaeetus which are called sea eagles. It also mentions that both the common and scientific names come from the distinctive appearance of the adult's head. Then it explains that ""bald"" comes from ""piebald "" referring to white head and tail feathers contrasting with a darker body.  Looking at the context again I see that the genus is mentioned as Haliaeetus right after introducing sea eagles. The scientific name is derived from Haliaeetus which makes sense because genus names are usually in italics or italicized but here written out as Haliaeetus with quotes perhaps? No looking back actually the context says ""New Latin for 'sea eagle' (from Ancient Greek haliaetos)"" and then mentions leucocephalus. So the scientific name is a combination of these parts.  But I'm focusing on the genus here. The first line clearly states that bald eagles are placed in the genus Haliaeetus which refers to sea eagles. So the genus must be Haliaeetus.

Question: which british city is farthest from the sea
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out which British city is the farthest from the sea based on the context provided. Let me read through the given information carefully.  The context talks about a village called Coton in the Elms in Derbyshire England. It mentions that Coton is the furthest place in the UK from coastal waters located 70 miles (113 km) away. The population was 896 according to the 2011 census. Additionally it's situated 5 miles southwest of Swadlincote and 6 miles south of Burton upon Trent.  Wait a minute so Coton is described as the furthest from the sea not a city. The question asks about British cities though. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Perhaps the context is pointing towards Coton being in the middle of nowhere relative to the sea but it's still a village within Derbyshire.  I need to see if there are any other cities mentioned nearby. Swadlincote and Burton upon Trent are both places but neither seem like major cities. The only significant city I can think of near Coton is Derby since Coton is in the Elms area which might be around Derby.  But according to the context Coton itself isn't a city—it's a village or parish. So maybe the answer lies elsewhere. However based on the information given the furthest point from the sea in Britain is 70 miles outside of Coton so perhaps that's where the nearest city might be?  Wait but the question specifically asks for a British city not a place. The closest major city to Coton would probably be Derby. I think Coton being far from the sea and near Derby is significant here.  So putting it all together: the furthest point from the sea in Britain is 70 miles from Coton in the Elms which is about 5 miles from Swadlincote and 6 from Burton upon Trent. Since these are both small towns the nearest major city would be Derby so perhaps the answer is Derby.  But I'm a bit confused because the context focuses on Coton as the furthest point not the nearest city. So maybe the correct answer isn't in the options but directly relates to Coton being the farthest from the sea even though it's a village.

It mentions that it follows the contours of the brain's structures like gyri and sulci. Additionally the pia mater has blood vessels piercing through it with capillaries supplying the brain.   I remember that the meninges are divided into three layers: the dura mater which is the outer tough layer; the arachnoid mater which lies just beneath the dura; and the pia mater the innermost and most delicate layer. Since the question specifically asks about the layer connected to the brain I should focus on what's closest to it.  The pia mater adheres directly to the brain and spinal cord because that's where its structure follows the natural contours of the brain. The dura mater is outside this so it wouldn't be connected to the brain itself but rather surrounding it. The arachnoid layer is in between. Therefore the correct answer should be the pia mater.

Heart of palm may be eaten on its own , and often it is eaten in a salad .
Question: where is the heart of palm on a palm tree
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the heart of palm is on a palm tree. From what I remember the heart of palm refers to a vegetable that's part of certain palm trees. The context provided mentions it comes from the inner core and growing bud of palms like coconut palmito juçara Açaí palm sabal pupunha and pejibaye. It also says that while harvesting wild or single-stemmed palms can kill the tree clonal palms are okay with moderate harvesting.  So to answer where it is on a palm tree... Well the heart of palm isn't an actual heart but probably refers to a part near the trunk. The inner core and growing bud would be higher up because the outer parts are more exposed so cutting those might affect growth. Therefore the heart of palm is likely found in the upper part of the palm tree's trunk maybe around where the branches start or towards the top. I think it's probably near the trunk area but not at the very base.

Question: term limits for house of representatives and senate
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the term limits for both the House of Representatives and the Senate based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again to make sure I understand it correctly.  The context starts by talking about the President's term limits. It says the President is limited to a total of two four-year terms. That's clear but that part isn't directly relevant to answering my question about the House and Senate.  Next there's information about the Vice President. It mentions that the Vice President can be elected multiple times by succession without any term limits even if they take office more than twice. For example if the President dies or resigns the Vice President could become President again each time. So for the Vice President it seems there are no term limits mentioned.  Then the context moves on to other parts of the government: the House of Representatives Senate Supreme Court etc. Specifically it says that the House of Representatives has ""Unlimited four-year terms."" That means there's no limit on how many times someone can serve in this position; they can be re-elected any number of times.  Moving further down the context states that the Senate also has ""Unlimited two-year terms."" This likely means that each Senator serves a maximum of two consecutive terms. I'm assuming each term is two years so the limit here is two terms per person.  I should double-check if there are any exceptions or additional rules mentioned for these bodies. The context doesn't mention any specific restrictions beyond the unlimited nature for the House and the two-year terms for the Senate. It's also noted that the Supreme Court justices have term limits only in practice but they can be appointed until retirement or stepping down.  So putting it together the answer should clearly state the unlimited four-year terms for the House of Representatives and the unlimited two-year terms for the Senate.  The U.S. House of Representatives has unlimited four-year terms allowing members to serve any number of consecutive terms.

Question: when is the next senate election in australia
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the next Senate election in Australia is. Let me think about this step by step.  First I know that Australia has two main elections for the Senate: federal and state/territory. The federal Senate elections are more significant because they have fewer members—only 63 seats—and these are determined by the federal election process. On the other hand state and territory elections can vary depending on which party holds power there.  Looking at the context provided it talks about a scheduled redistribution in Queensland starting on January 6 2017 which is expected to finish by March 2018. This seems related to how seats are reallocated when states don't have enough members. So this would be part of preparing for a federal election.  Now the question is about the next Senate election overall in Australia. If there's a scheduled redistribution happening now it suggests that an upcoming federal election is likely soon after. The redistribution process usually happens around every five years or so to reallocate seats as population changes and other factors affect state budgets.  Considering that the last federal election was in 2019 I would expect the next one to be a bit later than that. Since the current redistribution started in 2017 it's likely that the next election is around 5-6 years from now. That would place it somewhere between 2024 and 2025.  However I should check if there are any other factors that might affect when the next election occurs. For example if a state holds an election for the federal Senate before the scheduled redistribution does that impact the timeline? But in this case since we're dealing with a redistribution starting now it's probably leading up to the next federal election.  So putting it all together the next Senate election is likely to be around mid-2024 or early 2025. That makes sense because federal elections typically occur every four years in Australia.  The next Senate election in Australia is expected to take place in 2024 or 2025., next senate election in australia is expected to take place in 2024 or 2025,On or before 18 May 2019,0,0.1,3.4983548000018345,0.0012230265168276585,0.00035910576765903093,0.0,0.0,0.0

Context: A common use of the term `` air gap '' in home plumbing refers to a fixture that provides back - flow prevention for an installed dishwasher . This `` air gap '' is seen above the countertop as a small cylindrical fixture mounted parallel with the faucet . Below the countertop , the drain pipe of the dishwasher feeds the `` top '' of the air gap , and the `` bottom '' of the air gap is plumbed into the sink drain below the basket , or into a garbage disposal unit . When installed and maintained properly , the air gap works as described above , and prevents drain water from the sink from backing up into the dishwasher , possibly contaminating dishes . Water flowing from the fixture into the sink indicates a need for maintenance or repair .
Question: what does the air gap do on a dishwasher
Answer: ","Okay so I'm trying to figure out what an air gap does on a dishwasher. From what I remember reading earlier it's something related to plumbing and preventing backflow of drain water. Let me break this down.  First the term ""air gap"" in home plumbing is mentioned as referring to a fixture that prevents back-flow for a dishwasher. So it's a physical space or structure that stops water from flowing the wrong way. The context describes it as a small cylindrical fixture above the countertop. That makes sense because you want something to be there when the drain is connected below.  It says the air gap is mounted parallel with the faucet. Hmm so maybe it's installed alongside where the sink or faucet would be. Below the countertop the drain of the dishwasher connects into the top part of the air gap. Then the bottom of this fixture goes into the sink drain or garbage disposal unit below.  So putting that together when everything is set up properly the air gap acts as a barrier between two parts: the sink and the dishwasher's drain. Without it water from the sink could potentially back up into the dishwasher which might contaminate dishes or cause damage. The fixture probably allows for some air to flow freely hence the name ""air gap "" but prevents the continuous flow of water in the opposite direction.  The context also mentions that when water flows from the fixture into the sink it indicates a need for maintenance or repair. That suggests that if the air gap isn't functioning correctly—maybe because something is plugged up—the water might not flow properly hence needing fixing.  Putting this all together I think the main function of the air gap in a dishwasher is to prevent the sink's drainwater from backing into the dishwasher thereby keeping the system clean and preventing potential damage. It acts as a one-way valve sort of thing but using an air-filled space to allow water to flow only in the correct direction.  I'm trying to visualize it: above the countertop there's this cylinder that connects to the sink and below that cylinder is connected to the dishwasher's drain. So when you flush the sink the water goes through the air gap into the sink not going back up into the dishwater. That way any dirty water from dishes can't flow back into the sink.  I think I've got it now. The air gap ensures that there's no backflow of water from the sink to the dishwasher maintaining cleanliness and preventing issues like mold or damage on the dishes.  The air gap in a dishwasher acts as a barrier between the sink drain and the dishwasher's drain preventing water from flowing from the sink into the dishwasher. This prevents contamination of dishes and maintains system cleanliness by ensuring water flows only in the correct direction allowing proper drainage and maintenance without backflow issues.", air gap in dishwasher acts as barrier between sink drain and dishwashers drain preventing water from flowing from sink into dishwasher this prevents contamination of dishes and maintains system cleanliness by ensuring water flows only in correct direction allowing proper drainage and maintenance without backflow issues,"prevents drain water from the sink from backing up into the dishwasher, possibly contaminating dishes",0,0.2711864406779661,4.63375090000045,0.0016211729546373877,0.00047600975970102757,0.0,0.0,0.0
879,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: In OpenStreetMap , areas ( like the boundary of Russia ) are split at the 180th meridian .
Question: what is the 180 degree line of longitude called
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what the 180-degree line of longitude is called. I remember that lines of longitude run from the North Pole to the South Pole and are also known as meridians. They all converge at these poles. Now there's something special about the 180th meridian. From what I recall it's actually referred to by a specific name because it serves as an important reference point in geography.  I think it might be called the International Date Line but wait isn't that where countries change their date when crossing it? Or is that something else? No no I'm confusing it. The 180th meridian itself isn't just a date line; it's actually used as a boundary in cartography to split the Earth into two hemispheres. So maybe it's called the antimeridian?  Wait yes! The term ""meridian"" refers to any vertical line on a map connecting the poles but when specifically talking about the 180th meridian it has an official name. It is indeed known as the antimeridian because it's opposite of the prime meridian at 0 degrees. So if someone mentions that longitude they're pointing to this specific line which acts as a kind of dividing line between the eastern and western hemispheres.  Another thought: I think the term ""prime meridian"" is well-known for being the starting point (0 degrees) so the opposite would naturally be called the antimeridian. That makes sense because it's used in navigation and mapping software to calculate time zones as well especially around the 180th meridian where you cross into a new day.  So putting it all together the 180-degree line of longitude is called the antimeridian. It's important for various geographical and cartographical purposes including dividing the world into Eastern and Western Hemispheres and handling date changes across the Pacific Ocean.  The 180-degree line of longitude is called the **antimeridian**.", 180degree line of longitude is called antimeridian,antimeridian,0,0.25,3.3543069000006653,0.0011726182760854308,0.00034430487026309187,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who said what we got here is failure to communicate
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who says ""What we've got here is failure to communicate"" from the Cool Hand Luke movie. Let me start by recalling the context given. The phrase comes from a scene where Strother Martin plays Captain and then later Paul Newman's character Luke speaks it.   First Strother Martin is the Captain in the original speech. He says this line to Luke as a challenge or criticism. Then when Paul Newman takes over he uses the same phrase again but abridged. I think the full version was spoken by the Captain and then shortened by Luke.  I'm pretty sure that's correct because Cool Hand Luke is known for its use of prison dialogue and this quote is often cited as an example of effective communication within a correctional setting.

Question: when did the last volcano erupt in iceland
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the last volcano in Iceland erupted. The context provided mentions two eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull: one in 2010 and another in 2014. It also talks about an eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 but that's not relevant to Iceland.  I remember from the context that Eyjafjallajökull is a volcano in Iceland so its eruptions are the key here. The first eruption was in April 2010 and the second one happened again in 2014 after a long period of silence. Since the question asks for the last eruption before any others it's probably referring to the more recent one.  I should make sure that there aren't any other eruptions mentioned besides these two. The context doesn't mention any others so I can safely assume the last one is in 2014.  The last volcano in Iceland Eyjafjallajökull erupted in 2014.

Question: who is opening for little mix glory days tour
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out who is opening for the Little Mix Glory Days Tour based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the data carefully.  Looking at the context there's a section titled ""Europe -- Glory Days and Summer Shout Out Tour."" This seems to be part of a larger tour named Glory Days. Under this title I see dates from various cities across Europe with different opening acts listed. For example on 21 May 2017 in Birkenhead the opening act is N/A but on other dates like 8 June and 14 July the opening acts are also marked as N/A.  Wait that's confusing because I'm looking for an opening act so maybe ""N/A"" means there isn't one. But then in some entries there are bands listed under ""Opening Acts."" For instance on 28 May 2017 in Hull the opening acts are N / A but later dates like 6 July and 8 July have specific bands listed as opening acts.  I'm trying to find if Little Mix is one of these opening acts. Scanning through each date's ""Opening Acts"" column:  - June 2nd entry (date not specified) lists The Vamps as the opening act. - Other dates like 10 June 6 July etc. also list The Vamps.  Wait looking at 5 June 2017 in Copenhagen the opening acts are N / A. So maybe there's a mistake or inconsistency here because other parts mention The Vamps as opening acts multiple times.  Since the question is about Little Mix I'm checking if they're listed anywhere else. In some sections like under Europe -- Summer Shout Out Tour there's an entry with ""Zénoné"" and ""Eua "" but those aren't Little Mix either.  Wait in a separate section titled ""Oceania -- Glory Days Tour "" on 28 July 2017 in Brisbane the opening act is The Vamps. So consistently The Vamps are listed as opening acts multiple times across different dates and locations within the Europe tour.  Given that Little Mix isn't mentioned anywhere else in the context provided it's possible they aren't part of this particular tour or maybe their info wasn't included here. But based on what's present The Vamps are consistently listed as opening acts.

Question: when does the flash season 4 episode 3 air
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when Season 4 Episode 3 of ""The Flash"" airs. Let me go through the context provided step by step.  First looking at the context it's a list of episodes with details like Name Written By Directed By Original Air Date Prod. Code U.S. viewers (in millions) and other details for each episode from October 2017 to January 2018.  I need to find Season 4 Episode 3. I'll go through each entry one by one until I spot ""Season 4"" or the episode number mentioned as #3.   Looking at Episode 7 titled ""Therefore I Am "" it's from November 21 2017 (2017-11-21). The details don't mention the season directly but do note it's part of a crossover with other shows.  Episodes 8 and beyond are listed as Season TBA which probably stands for ""To Be Announced."" So episode numbers after that like Episode 9 under December 5 2017 (2017-12-05) also don't specify the season.   Wait a minute I just noticed something important: in the provided context there's no mention of Season 4 at all. All episodes listed are from Season TBA or different seasons but not clearly stated as Season 4.  Since none of the entries explicitly state Season 4 it might be that this information isn't included in the provided data. Alternatively perhaps the user is referring to a specific episode and wants to know when it aired based on context clues.  Looking again at Episode 3: ""Elongated Journey Into Night "" which is listed under October 31 2017 (2017-10-31). The season for that episode isn't specified here. However the user is asking about Season 4 Episode 3.  If I had to guess based on typical TV schedules Season 4 of ""The Flash"" usually airs in early fall similar to how previous seasons did. Previous episodes in the provided context are from October and November so it's possible that Season 4 Episode 3 aired around that time frame maybe late October or early November.  But without explicit information here I can't be certain. The best approach is to acknowledge that the specific episode details aren't available in the given context.  The specific information about when Season 4 Episode 3 of ""The Flash""airs isn't provided in the context. However based on typical TV schedules it's likely to have aired during early fall or late October/early November.

884,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Thomas Edison . While other inventors had produced devices that could record sounds , Edison 's phonograph was the first to be able to reproduce the recorded sound . His phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder . A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages . Later improvements through the years included modifications to the turntable and its drive system , the stylus or needle , and the sound and equalization systems .
Question: who made possible the first reproduction of the human voice on the phonograph
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out who made it possible for the first reproduction of the human voice on the phonograph. Let's see... The context provided talks about Edison inventing the phonograph in 1877 but it mentions that while he was able to reproduce the sound other inventors had recorded sounds before him. So who did those earlier recordings?  The next part says that Bell made improvements in the 1880s with something called the graphophone. It specifically mentions a wax-coated cardboard cylinder and a cutting stylus that created zig-zag grooves. So Bell's lab introduced these changes including the use of a different type of cylinder.  Wait so if Edison was the first to have a phonograph that could reproduce sound but others had done recording before him? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read again: ""Edison's phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder."" Then Bell improved upon it by making it graphophone with different materials and stylus.  So the first reproduction would be Edison because he created the phonograph that could actually reproduce sounds after recording. But others had just recorded sounds before him? Hmm. The question is about who made possible the first reproduction of the human voice on the phonograph. So maybe it's Bell because he improved the mechanism for recording and playback allowing for better sound reproduction.  Wait no Edison's phonograph already had the ability to reproduce. Maybe the key here is that Bell's improvements allowed for better reproduction quality. Or perhaps the initial reproduction was possible with Edison's device because he successfully recorded and played back sounds.  Alexander Graham Bell made significant improvements in the 1880s that enhanced sound recording making the first human voice reproduction on the phonograph possible.

Context: The record for most non-consecutive weeks at number one is 18 by Frankie Laine 's `` I Believe '' in 1953 . It spent nine weeks at number one , dropped down for a week , returned to number one for six weeks , dropped down for a further week and returned to number one for a third time for three weeks . It is one of five singles to return to number one more than once , the others being `` Singing the Blues '' by Guy Mitchell in 1957 , `` Happy '' by Pharrell Williams in 2014 , `` What Do You Mean ? '' by Justin Bieber in 2015 and `` Despacito '' by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber in 2017 .
Question: what is the longest running uk number 1 single
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what the longest-running UK Number 1 single is based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  The context mentions Frankie Laine's ""I Believe"" from 1953. It spent nine weeks at number one then dropped for a week came back and stayed there for six weeks went down again for a week and returned once more for three weeks. So that totals up to 9 + 6 + 3 = 18 weeks at the top.  It also says this is one of five singles that hit number one more than once. The others are ""Singing the Blues"" by Guy Mitchell in 1957 which stayed for longer? Wait no it just says it's one of five so I need to check if any have a longer run.  Wait the context doesn't give exact numbers for the other singles except that they each returned more than once. It mentions ""Happy"" by Pharrell Williams in 2014 which I know was Number One for two weeks after its chart debut. Similarly ""What Do You Mean?"" by Justin Bieber was also there for a few weeks.  So focusing back on Frankie Laine's song: it had the most non-consecutive weeks at number one with 18. Since this is more than any of the others mentioned (like Pharrell's two weeks) I think that makes ""I Believe"" the longest-running Number One single in the UK.  Frankie Laine's ""I Believe"" is the longest-running UK Number 1 single spending a total of 18 non-consecutive weeks at the top.

Context: Tyrion Lannister ( season 1 -- present ) portrayed by Peter Dinklage . Nicknamed `` The Imp '' or `` Halfman '' , Tyrion Lannister of House Lannister is the younger brother of Cersei and Jaime Lannister . He is a dwarf ; and his mother died during his birth , for which his father , Tywin Lannister , blames him . While not physically powerful , Tyrion has a cunning mind and often uses to his advantage the fact that others constantly underestimate him . In Season Three , Tyrion is given the job of Master of Coin , a role that he is unprepared and inexperienced for . Tyrion is commanded by his father to marry Sansa Stark ; however , on the wedding night , Tyrion refuses to consummate his marriage and instead lets Sansa sleep alone , promising not to touch her unless she wanted him to . The death of her brother Robb , in which Tyrion took no part , causes a further rift between the couple and between Tyrion and his father , who he claims ca n't distinguish between his interests and his often - praised ideal of devotion to family . Tywin bitterly claims that he had wanted to drown Tyrion upon birth , but stayed himself for the sake of duty . In season 4 , Tyrion welcomes Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne to King 's Landing for Joffrey 's wedding to Margaery Tyrell , though Oberyn implies to Tyrion that his true purpose is to seek vengeance for his sister , who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane on Tywin 's orders . When Joffrey is fatally poisoned , Tyrion is framed and arrested . Tyrion , however , implies that Cersei knows of his innocence and just wants him dead . At Tyrion 's trial , he demands a trial by combat . Tyrion is approached by Oberyn , who volunteers to be his champion in order to fight Cersei 's champion , Ser Gregor Clegane . When Oberyn loses the fight and is killed , Tyrion is sentenced to death . Jaime , however , frees Tyrion and arranges for him to escape King 's Landing . Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae , who testified against him and is now Tywin 's lover . After a brief struggle , Tyrion strangles Shae to death , and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey 's crossbow . Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys . They arrive in Pentos , where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne . Tyrion is bound and gagged by Jorah Mormont , who says that he will take him to Daenerys . Daenerys takes them both to her home in the Great Pyramid of Meereen and asks Tyrion why he is here . Tyrion tells her everything , including Varys ' plan . He initially counsels her to stay in Meereen , but Daenerys makes it plain to him that her eyes are still on Westeros . Tyrion tells Daenerys how hard it will be to win the love of both the common people and the nobles . He later joins her at the opening celebrations of Daznak 's Pit , where Jorah unexpectedly reappears to defeat every other foe on the arena . As the Sons of the Harpy attack , Tyrion manages to survive by fleeing to the midst of the arena , where they are rescued by Drogon , while Daenerys is spirited away on his back . In season 6 , Tyrion struggles to maintain peace in Meereen , particularly when the Sons of the Harpy burn the entire Meereenese Navy , stranding them in Slaver 's Bay . Following an alliance with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , Tyrion advises Daenerys to break up with Daario so that she may pursue a marriage alliance in Westeros . In gratitude for Tyrion 's loyalty , Daenerys names him her official Hand , and he accompanies her back to Westeros . In season 7 Tyrion 's advice to Daenerys often conflicts with her views , and he has mixed success in directing her actions . He sneaks into King 's Landing and meets with Jamie to set up a meeting between Cersei and Daenerys , which eventually happens in the Dragonpit outside the city . At the meeting a captured wight is produced to convince Cersei that the worst threat is from beyond the Wall . When Cersei is not convinced , Tyrion risks execution to meet with his sister to try again to persuade her . He is unexpectedly allowed to leave Cersei 's presence alive , and thinks he has secured an agreement from her to help with the fight against the Wight Walkers .
Question: what's the dwarf's name in game of thrones
Answer: ","Okay I need to find out the dwarf's name from Game of Thrones based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.  Looking at the first part it says Tyrion Lannister is a dwarf whose mother died during his birth. So that means his name isn't mentioned there. Then in Season Three he marries Sansa Stark but gets kicked out because of Robb's death and their relationship with the father.  In Season 4 Tyrion welcomes Oberyn Martell who is from Dorne. He tells him about Cersei wanting to kill him for Joffrey's murder. Later on Tyrion is framed and tried; he demands a combat trial against Cersei's champion Ser Gregor Clegane. After losing that fight Tyrion gets killed.  Jaime Lannister frees Tyrion and they escape from King's Landing. They later meet Tywin in his chambers where Shae who testified against Tyrion is now his lover. There's a struggle between them leading to both deaths.  Tyrion then goes with Varys to Meereen helping Daenerys take the Iron Throne. He tells her everything about their plan and initially tries to convince her but she still focuses on Westeros. They face dangers in the battle against the Sons of the Harpy but eventually escape.  In Season 6 Tyrion helps Daenerys by forming an alliance with Theon and Yara Greyjoy. In Season 7 he gives Daenerys a hand but their advice often conflicts. He manages to get Cersei convinced about the Wight Walkers threat despite her initial refusal.  So the key point is that Tyrion's mother died during his birth. The context doesn't provide a specific name for him beyond ""The Imp"" or ""Halfman."" Since he's portrayed by Peter Dinklage but in the context given no actual name of his is mentioned except as part of nicknames.  Therefore based on the provided info Tyrion Lannister's full name isn't detailed. He might be referred to as just Tyrion or sometimes called ""The dwarf"" due to being a dwarf character.

Context: In late 2017 , `` hours '' of Discovery - based content will be added to the role playing video game Star Trek Timelines , including Michael Burnham and Saru as new crew members for the game and new ships from the show , both Federation and otherwise . A month long `` Mega-Event '' based on the series will also take place .
Question: when does the next star trek episode come out
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the next Star Trek episode is going to come out. The context provided mentions something about ""Mega-Events"" related to the series. Let me break this down.  First the context says that in late 2017 they're adding hours of Discovery-based content to Star Trek Timelines. This includes characters like Michael Burnham and Saru as new crew members for the game. There are also new ships from the show both Federation and others. Plus there's a month-long Mega-Event based on the series.  Wait so the Mega-Event is happening in late 2017? The context says it's ""a month long."" I'm trying to remember when Star Trek episodes typically air. They usually release new episodes seasonally right?  But the question is about when the next episode comes out. Since the Mega-Event is a month-long event based on the series and considering that Star Trek usually has multiple episodes per season maybe the next episode is related to this event.  If late 2017 includes December then the next episode could be in early December or so. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact date. Alternatively if it's a month-long event starting at the end of October maybe the episode is scheduled for later in that month perhaps November.  Wait but the context doesn't specify the exact episode release date only the Mega-Event duration and timing. So without more info on when the next specific episode drops I can assume it's probably during or after the Mega-Event period.  The next Star Trek episode is likely to air during or after the month-long Mega-Event in late 2017 possibly in November or early December.

Question: which movie wins 4 awards in 75th golden globe award
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which movie won four awards at the 75th Golden Globe Award based on the context provided. Let me start by reading through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri"" won the most awards for the evening with four including Best Motion Picture -- Drama. It also notes that The Shape of Water and Lady Bird each won two awards. Then it lists some television shows that received multiple awards but doesn't mention them in relation to the movies.  So focusing on the first part: ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri"" won four awards. These include Best Motion Picture -- Drama which is one category. The context also says they won four awards for the evening so I'm assuming these are the total awards they received across different categories.  The question specifically asks about the 75th Golden Globe Award and how many movies won multiple awards. From the context ""Three Billboards"" is the movie that took home four awards. So even though the other films like The Shape of Water and Lady Bird each won two ""Three Billboards"" led with four.  I should make sure I'm not missing anything else in the context that might affect this answer. It doesn't mention any other movies receiving multiple awards beyond what's stated for these three. Therefore it seems clear that ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri"" is the movie that won four awards at the 75th Golden Globe.  The movie ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri"" won four awards at the 75th Golden Globe Award.

Question: who is the present president of assam sahitya sabha
Answer: ",Okay so I need to find out who the current president of the Assam Sahitya Sabha is. Let me look through the context provided.  I see a list starting from 1917 up to 2017 with various years and names. The last entry before the one about Dhrubajyoti Bora Kaliabor in 2017 would be 2016 which is also listed twice for 2015 and 2016.  Looking at the entries:  - 2015: Dhrubajyoti Bora Kaliabor - 2016: Dhrubajyoti Bora Kaliabor (listed twice) - Then 2017 but it's repeated three times for some reason.

891,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: Like most mineral nutrients , the majority of the iron absorbed from digested food or supplements is absorbed in the duodenum by enterocytes of the duodenal lining . These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body . To be absorbed , dietary iron can be absorbed as part of a protein such as heme protein or iron must be in its ferrous Fe form . A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes ' brush border , duodenal cytochrome B ( Dcytb ) , reduces ferric Fe to Fe . A protein called divalent metal transporter 1 ( DMT1 ) , which can transport several divalent metals across the plasma membrane , then transports iron across the enterocyte 's cell membrane into the cell .
Question: where is fe best absorbed in the body
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where ferrous iron is best absorbed in the body. Let's see from what I remember it's related to the digestive system. The context mentioned that most mineral nutrients are absorbed in the duodenum by enterocytes. Enterocytes are cells in the lining of the duodenum.  The context talks about how dietary iron needs to be in a specific form to be absorbed. It can't just float around in the blood; it has to attach to a protein called transferrin which is a heme protein. Without that the body doesn't know how to absorb it properly.  Then there's this ferric reductase enzyme on the brush border of the enterocytes. This enzyme converts ferric iron (Fe³+) into ferrous iron (Fe²+) making it compatible with transferrin. Once it's in the right form the body can absorb it using another protein called divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). DMT1 helps transport iron across the enterocyte membrane into the cell.  So putting that all together the absorption starts when ferric iron is reduced to ferrous by ferric reductase. Then DMT1 moves it into the enterocytes which are in the duodenum. Therefore ferrous iron is best absorbed in the duodenum via these specific proteins.  Ferrous iron is best absorbed in the duodenum through the action of ferric reductase and divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1).   Answer: Ferrous iron is absorbed primarily in the duodenum by enterocytes with assistance from ferric reductase converting it to ferrous form and DMT1 transporting it across cell membranes.,ferrous iron is absorbed primarily in duodenum by enterocytes with assistance from ferric reductase converting it to ferrous form and dmt1 transporting it across cell membranes,in the duodenum by enterocytes of the duodenal lining,0,0.24242424242424246,2.9367455000028713,0.0010183923159997224,0.00029902095284388056,0.0,0.0,0.0

Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out what this question is about. The user provided some context saying that a section needs expansion and can be helped by adding content. Then the question asks about chemicals produced in one part of a plant that affect other parts.  Hmm from my basic biology knowledge plants have various parts like roots stem leaves flowers etc. I remember something about hormones being sent through tissues or something like that. Maybe it's about signaling between different parts?  So maybe the answer is related to signaling molecules? Like hormones such as auxins or phytohormones. These could be produced in one part and affect other parts of the plant.  Wait but what exactly do these chemicals do? They probably influence growth development or responses to environmental changes like light water temperature. So the answer should mention how they work between different parts.

Context: The United States presidential line of succession is the order in which persons may become or act as President of the United States if the incumbent President becomes incapacitated , dies , resigns , or is removed from office ( by impeachment by the House of Representatives and subsequent conviction by the Senate ) . The line of succession is set by the United States Constitution and the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 as subsequently amended to include newly created cabinet offices . The succession follows the order of Vice President , Speaker of the House of Representatives , President pro tempore of the Senate , and then the heads of federal executive departments who form the Cabinet of the United States . The Cabinet currently has fifteen members , beginning with the Secretary of State , and followed by the rest in the order of their positions ' creation . Those heads of department who are ineligible to act as President are also ineligible to succeed the President by succession , for example most commonly if they are not a natural - born U.S. citizen .
Question: who succeeds the speaker of the house as president
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who succeeds the Speaker of the House when becoming President of the United States. From what I remember in history class the line of succession for the presidency isn't just about one person; it's a specific order based on certain roles within Congress and the bureaucracy.  First I recall that after the Vice President the next in line is the Speaker of the House of Representatives. That makes sense because Congress has a significant role in oversight and legislative matters. So if the current President can't serve for whatever reason—like illness or resignation—the Vice President would take over first. Then if they're unable to serve as well the Speaker of the House steps in.  I'm trying to remember if there are any exceptions or special cases where someone other than these two could take over. Wait I think there might be a mention of the President pro tempore of the Senate coming into play after the Speaker but that's not relevant here because we're talking about the Speaker succeeding the President.  I also recall something about the order of the Cabinet members being based on their creation starting with the Secretary of State. But since the question is about the Speaker of the House I don't need to go into that unless it affects things.   So putting it all together: after the Vice President it's the Speaker of the House who would be next in line to become President if needed.

Context: As with all casino games , blackjack incorporates a `` house edge '' , a statistical advantage for the casino that is built into the game . The advantage of the dealer 's position in blackjack relative to the player comes from the fact that if the player busts , the player loses , regardless of whether the dealer subsequently busts . Nonetheless , blackjack players using basic strategy will lose less than 1 % of their total wagered amount with strictly average luck ; this is very favorable to the player compared to other casino games . The loss rate of players who deviate from basic strategy through ignorance is generally expected to be greater .
Question: what advantage does the dealer have in blackjack
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what advantage the dealer has in blackjack based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The first sentence says that blackjack incorporates a ""house edge "" which is a statistical advantage for the casino. It mentions that this advantage comes from the fact that if the player busts they lose regardless of whether the dealer also busts. Hmm so when does the dealer have an advantage?  Well normally in blackjack both the player and the dealer hit or stand based on certain rules without exceeding 21 (busting). If the player goes over 21 they lose immediately. But if the dealer also busts that doesn't affect the player's loss because the player has already busted before the dealer could. So this setup gives the casino an edge because when a player busts the dealer can either bust or not but the player loses regardless.  Additionally the context mentions that players using basic strategy will only lose less than 1% of their total wagers with average luck. This shows how favorable it is for players to follow basic strategy compared to other casino games where the house edge might be higher if players don't play correctly.  So putting this together the dealer's advantage lies in having an automatic win scenario when both the player busts and the dealer doesn't have to take any action that could change the outcome. Therefore the dealer can gain an edge because they aren't responsible for the player's bust.  The dealer has a statistical advantage because if the player busts the dealer automatically wins without affecting the outcome further.", dealer has statistical advantage because if player busts dealer automatically wins without affecting outcome further,"if the player busts, the player loses, regardless of whether the dealer subsequently busts",0,0.30769230769230765,2.6849501999968197,0.0009359390223412932,0.00027481096809880073,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: where did the name black death come from
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out where the name ""black death"" comes from. The context provided mentions that Gilles de Corbeil used it in his work. From what I recall Corbeil was a French physician around the 12th century. He wrote about diseases and he referred to something as ""atra mors "" which translates to ""to the dead.""   Wait so if he called a pestilential fever that way maybe it's because the disease affected the body in a way that looked like death? Like perhaps the blackness was seen when the body lost color. Alternatively the term might have been used metaphorically to denote something severe and life-threatening.  I think ""black death"" stuck because of its association with something so virulent and destructive maybe it made people lose their color or look more decomposed hence the name stuck as a dramatic descriptor for the plague.  The term ""black death"" comes from Gilles de Corbeil's reference to a pestilential fever as ""atra mors "" meaning ""to the dead.""

Then it talks about Atlético Madrid winning the league in the 2013-14 season which means they have at least one trophy each from different competitions as well.  Next Barcelona has a special record because they've won both the league and the Copa del Rey in the same year six times. That's impressive; it means they've had multiple Trebles (winning three major trophies) and even more than that since they're the only ones with six double titles.  The context also mentions that Barcelona is the only Spanish team to have won the Treble which includes the Champions League along with the league and Copa del Rey.

Question: who wants to be millionaire phone a friend
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the answer to the question ""who wants to be millionaire phone a friend"" based on the provided context. Let me break this down step by step.  First I'll read through the context again carefully to understand what it's talking about. The Play It! attraction was inspired by a TV show. In that show they had something called ""Fastest Finger "" which involved ordering four answers quickly. The person who did it fastest would be the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that episode.  However when the game actually started contestants weren't competing for real money. Instead they earned points and there were time limits on the questions. There was also a lifeline called ""Phone a Friend "" which in this context became ""Phone a Complete Stranger."" This meant contestants could call Disney cast members outside the attraction's theater to get help by connecting with someone who knew a guest willing to assist.  After each contestant finished their game they were awarded various prizes ranging from collectible pins and clothing to a Millionaire CD game or even a chance to win for three nights on a Disney Cruise. So these were all possible rewards available after the game was over.  Now focusing on the question: ""who wants to be millionaire phone a friend."" From the context I can see that the lifeline in this attraction is called ""Phone a Complete Stranger "" which connects contestants to Disney cast members who are complete strangers but still willing to help. So essentially it's like calling any Disney employee for assistance without knowing their specific connection.  The question seems to be asking what the lifeline was called. The context explains that the Phone a Friend became Phone a Complete Stranger because the contestant couldn't rely on knowing who they were talking to beforehand. Therefore the answer should reflect this change in name and description.  The ""Phone a Friend"" lifeline in the Play It! attraction is referred to as ""Phone a Complete Stranger.""

So maybe it's an animated version or some adaptation that focuses on space themes.  Since the seal is from 2010 the movie probably came out around then or just after. I should check what was happening in the movie industry during that time to see if any notable animated films focused on space were released. One possibility could be ""Lilo & Stitch "" but that's more about a Hawaiian adventure than space. Another might be something like ""Stake Land "" which is an animated film about space exploration.  Wait there was also ""The Iron Giant"" released in 2010 but that's not related to space either. Hmm maybe it's a lesser-known or indie film. Alternatively perhaps the movie is based directly on the book and expands on the original story with more focus on space elements like planets alien life or space travel.  I'm trying to recall if there was any official animated feature released in 2010 about space that's well-received for kids. Maybe ""Earth to Moon"" is another option? No that doesn't sound familiar either.   Alternatively maybe it's a documentary or a special feature included with a movie. For example ""Men in Black: Double Agent"" was released around 2010 and has some sci-fi elements but that's more of an action movie.  Wait perhaps I should think about the criteria for the Parents' Choice Awards seal. It looks for educational value entertainment and positive messages. So the movie must have a good balance of these aspects especially suitable for children. If it's about space maybe it teaches kids about planets or space exploration in an engaging way.  I'm not 100% sure but I think ""The Iron Giant"" was released in 2010 and is based on a book by William Steig. It's more of a fantasy adventure with a dinosaur setting so probably not the space one.   Another thought: Maybe it's an educational film produced by Disney or another studio that focuses on making learning fun through animation. For example ""Dora and the Time Machine"" includes some time travel elements but is more about solving puzzles than space.  Wait I'm overcomplicating this. The question provides a context where the seal was recommended for the movie so it's definitely something notable from 2010 that has to do with space given the title and the original book's focus on outer space.  I think the correct answer is ""The Iron Giant"" but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively maybe it's another film that's less well-known but still meets the criteria for the seal because of its educational content about space.  ""The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About Space Movie"" is a 2010 animated film based on Dr. Seuss's original book which explores outer space and imaginative themes through a series of adventures and lessons for children.

Question: when do the oakland raiders move to vegas
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the Oakland Raiders moved to Las Vegas based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that NFL team owners voted 31-1 to approve the move which was announced at the annual league meetings in Phoenix Arizona on March 27 2017. So the announcement date is March 27 2017.  It also says that the Raiders will begin playing as the Las Vegas Raiders for the 2020 NFL season although there's a possibility they could move earlier possibly in 2019 with Sam Boyd Stadium. But since the move was announced on March 27 2017 that's when it happened.  I don't need to consider other relocations like the Rams and Chargers because the question is specifically about the Raiders moving to Las Vegas.

Context: The lac gene and its derivatives are amenable to use as a reporter gene in a number of bacterial - based selection techniques such as two hybrid analysis , in which the successful binding of a transcriptional activator to a specific promoter sequence must be determined . In LB plates containing X-gal , the colour change from white colonies to a shade of blue corresponds to about 20 - 100 β - galactosidase units , while tetrazolium lactose and MacConkey lactose media have a range of 100 - 1000 units , being most sensitive in the high and low parts of this range respectively . Since MacConkey lactose and tetrazolium lactose media both rely on the products of lactose breakdown , they require the presence of both lacZ and lacY genes . The many lac fusion techniques which include only the lacZ gene are thus suited to X-gal plates or ONPG liquid broths .
Question: what the role of the protein encoded by the lacz gene
Answer: ",Alright so I'm trying to figure out the role of the protein encoded by the lacZ gene. From the context provided it mentions that the lac gene and its derivatives are used as reporter genes in bacterial systems. It also talks about two hybrid analysis and X-gal plates where white colonies turn blue when certain conditions are met.  The context further explains that beta-galactosidase is involved which I know is an enzyme that breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose. But here it's specifically talking about the role of the lacZ gene. The text says that MacConkey lactose and tetrazolium media rely on the products from lactose breakdown meaning they require both lacZ and lacY genes. So I think this is important because lacZ encodes beta-galactosidase.  Wait but what's the exact role of the protein encoded by lacZ? From my basic biology knowledge lacZ is an enzyme that breaks down lactose in bacteria when the lac operon is active. In the presence of lactose and the absence of glucose the lac operon is induced leading to the expression of lacZ which produces beta-galactosidase.  So putting it all together the protein encoded by lacZ is beta-galactosidase an enzyme that cleaves lactose into smaller sugars. This makes sense because the media mentioned require both lacZ and lacY genes for the breakdown products to function properly.  The protein encoded by the lacZ gene is beta-galactosidase an enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose into glucose and galactose in bacteria when the lac operon is active., protein encoded by lacz gene is betagalactosidase enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose into glucose and galactose in bacteria when lac operon is active,"cleaves lactose, a disaccharide, into glucose and galactose",0,0.3225806451612903,2.996573600001284,0.0010314468461486222,0.00030285403169053423,0.0,0.0,0.0

In the Quran the ummah typically refers to a single group that shares common religious beliefs , specifically those that are the objects of a divine plan of salvation . In the context of Pan-Islamism and politics , the word Ummah can be used to mean the concept of a Commonwealth of the Believers ( أمة المؤمنين ummat al - mu'minīn ) .
Question: islamic term for the community of the faithful
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the Islamic term for the community of the faithful. The user provided some context about ""ummat"" in Islam and Pan-Islamism. Let me break this down.  The context mentions that ""ummat al - Islamiyah"" is a synonym for ""ammat al - islamiyyah "" which refers to the Islamic Community. It also says that ""Ummah"" can mean both a collective community of Islamic people and in Pan-Islamism the concept of a Commonwealth of the Believers or ""ummat al - mu'minīn.""  So when the question is asking for the term meaning the community of the faithful I should look at these definitions. The first part mentions that Ummah refers to the collective Islamic community which fits the question perfectly. Then in a political Pan-Islamist context it's used differently as ""ummat al - mu'minīn "" but since the question is about the general term for the community of the faithful the broader definition applies.  Therefore the answer should be ""Ummah"" because it directly corresponds to the community of believers or faithful in Islam. There's no need to overcomplicate it; just take the most direct synonym from the context provided.

Question: where did the river thames start and end
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the Thames River starts and ends based on the provided context. Let me go through the information step by step.  First I see that the context mentions two main locations for the Thames: its head (upstream) and mouth (downstream). The head is located in Gloucestershire UK at coordinates 51°41′39″N 2°01′47″W which converts to approximately 51.694262° N and -2.029724° W. It also notes that the Thames flows into the North Sea.  Next there's another location called Southend-on-Sea in Essex UK with coordinates 51°29′56″N 0°36′31″E approximately 51.4989° N and 0.6087° E. This is where the Thames estuary meets the North Sea.  Wait but I'm a bit confused now because the question asks for both start and end points. The context mentions two different mouths: Thames Head in Gloucestershire and Southend-on-Sea. But I think the Thames as a river starts at its mouth in the sea and flows into other bodies of water. So if the Thames is flowing into the North Sea at both locations perhaps it's split or has multiple sources? That doesn't make much sense.  Looking again the context says ""mouth Thames Estuary North Sea"" for Thames Head and also mentions Southend-on-Sea as where the Thames estuary meets the North Sea. So maybe both are points where the river ends in the sea. But that would imply two separate outlets of the same river into the same sea which is unusual.  Wait perhaps I'm misinterpreting this. The main Thames flows from its source to the mouth. If the context lists two places as the mouth (both flowing into the North Sea) maybe one is the primary mouth and the other is a tributary or something else? Or perhaps it's an error in the data.  Alternatively perhaps ""Thames Head"" refers to a specific spot where the river flows into the sea and Southend-on-Sea is another estuary. But I think that's unlikely because both being in the North Sea would mean they're different outlets from the same source. So maybe the correct start point is one of them and the end points are both showing where it flows out.  Wait but looking back at the context: The section under ""Source"" says ""Thames Head Gloucestershire  UK - elevation 110 m ( 361 ft ) - coordinates..."" So that's the mouth. Then the ""mouth Thames Estuary  North Sea"" is probably another mention of where it flows in or out.  But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to parse this again.  The first part: Source - location Thames Head Gloucestershire UK - elevation 110m coordinates given. So that's the mouth of the river.  Then Mouth Thames Estuary North Sea – same as the source? Or is it another mention?  Wait maybe ""Thames Head"" is where it starts (upstream) and flows into the North Sea at Southend-on-Sea. But I'm not sure if that makes sense because usually a river has one mouth unless it's a delta or something.  Alternatively perhaps the Thames' head is in Gloucestershire and its mouth is in Southend-on-Sea. So the start would be the head (upstream) and the end would be the mouth (downstream).  Wait but looking at the answer provided earlier: ""The Thames River starts at Thames Head (upstream) and flows into the North Sea."" But then it also mentions Southend-on-Sea as where the Thames estuary meets the North Sea. So maybe both are points where the river ends in the sea meaning that from Thames Head to Southend-on-Sea is the river's flow.  But I'm still confused because the context seems to list two different mouthpoints. Maybe the answer combines them saying it starts at Thames Head and flows into the North Sea through Southend-on-Sea.  Alternatively perhaps the correct start is Thames Head (downstream) but that doesn't make sense. No usually rivers have their sources upstream.  I think I need to clarify: The ""head"" is where a river starts flowing out of a lake or sea and into another body of water. So Thames Head in Gloucestershire would be the point where the river leaves a larger body (maybe Lake Avon) and flows into the sea at Southend-on-Sea.  But according to the context the mouth is mentioned as both Thames Head and Southend-on-Sea. That's conflicting. Perhaps it's better to stick with the first mention: that the Thames starts at Thames Head and flows into the North Sea (where it meets Southend-on-Sea).  So in summary I think the answer is that the Thames starts upstream (not given here) but ends by flowing into the North Sea near Southend-on-Sea. But the context doesn't specify where exactly it starts; only where it flows out.  Wait maybe the correct approach is to list the mouth as both locations since they're both mentioned under ""mouth."" So perhaps the river flows from its source (unknown) to both Thames Head and Southend-on-Sea but that seems unlikely. Alternatively it's a single mouth at Southend-on-Sea with the upstream flow described differently.  I think I need to focus on what the context provides: it mentions two locations for the mouth—Thames Head in Gloucestershire and Southend-on-Sea in Essex—and both are described as flowing into the North Sea. So maybe the river's mouth is at both places but that doesn't make sense geologically.  Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The context lists ""mouth Thames Estuary North Sea"" under the main location and then under the Mouth section again with Southend-on-Sea. Maybe it's just emphasizing that the Thames flows into the North Sea at Southend-on-Sea which is correct.  So to answer the question: where did the river Thames start and end? The start would be its source but since the context doesn't specify an upstream point perhaps it's considered to start from Thames Head (downstream) and flow into Southend-on-Sea. But that seems contradictory because usually you can't define a river's start without knowing where it comes from.  Alternatively the answer might state that the Thames flows into the North Sea at both Thames Head and Southend-on-Sea meaning its end points are those two locations but I don't think the river splits there. It's more likely that the context is incorrect or just emphasizing the mouth as Southend-on-Sea.  Given all this I'll stick with the answer provided earlier: ""The Thames River starts at Thames Head (upstream) and flows into the North Sea."" But considering the confusion in the context perhaps it's better to mention both ends but logically a river has one start and one end. So maybe Thames Head is where it starts and Southend-on-Sea is where it ends.  The Thames River starts at Thames Head (upstream) and flows into the North Sea near Southend-on-Sea.

Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the sequel came out based on the provided context. Let me read through the information again carefully.  The first part of the context mentions that New Line Cinema announced the sequel would be released on September 6 2019. That's pretty straightforward—it directly states the release date as September 6th 2019.  Then there are some details about who wrote the script and other writers involved. Gary Dauberman wrote the script for the sequel and Jeffrey Jurgensen was also listed as a screenwriter. But those details don't affect the release date; they're just additional information about who worked on it.  So the key piece of information I need is the date given in the first part. It's clearly stated there so I can use that without any confusion. There's no conflicting information elsewhere in the context that would change this date.

Question: who sings the christmas song all i want for christmas is you
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who sings the Christmas song ""All I Want for Christmas Is You."" Let me think about what I know. I remember that this is a pretty well-known holiday song. From context given earlier it's mentioned that it was performed by Mariah Carey and released in 1994 by Columbia Records.  Wait but did she actually write the song herself? The context says she wrote and produced it along with Walter Afanasieff. So she's both the singer and the writer. That makes sense because sometimes singers have written their own songs for albums or special projects.  I think I've heard this song before in the context of Christmas carols maybe in a TV show or a movie. It's upbeat and has a catchy melody with bells which aligns with the description given about bell chimes and heavy backup vocals. The mention of synthesizers adds to the modern element that might have been used in her music at the time.  So putting it all together: the singer is Mariah Carey. She wrote and produced it with Walter Afanasieff released on Columbia Records in 1994 as part of her album Merry Christmas (1994). The song is an uptempo love ballad with those bells and synthesizers.  Mariah Carey sings ""All I Want for Christmas Is You "" which she wrote and produced with Walter Afanasieff.

Question: country with most olympic gold medals all time
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which country has the most Olympic gold medals ever. Let me start by looking at the data provided. Hmm the table has a lot of information about different countries and various categories like athletes participants teams and specific years.  First I should focus on the row labeled ""Totals"" because that probably sums up all the gold medals each country has won over time. Looking at that row there's a number 28 mentioned under the column for Russia (RUS). Wait but I also see numbers like 546 under United States and 3168 under another category. Let me make sure.  Wait no actually looking again the ""Totals"" row doesn't just have one number; it's spread across multiple columns with different years or categories. So Russia has 28 in some column but also a much higher number like 546 in another. Similarly the United States has totals of 3168 and 28 for other numbers.  Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding. The ""Totals"" row might be aggregating all the medals across different categories or years. So Russia's total would include all their golds over time which is probably in the mid-500s. Similarly the United States has a higher number like 18 845 but that seems too high because that's likely including all medal types not just gold.  Wait no looking closer under Russia (RUS) the totals are 6 and 23 somewhere with 546 in another column. Maybe I need to look for the highest single-year total among countries. The highest number I see is 18 845 but that's probably not a gold medal count.  Wait let me check again. Under Russia (RUS) there are numbers like 9 395 319 296 and 1 010 in some columns with totals of 28 45 38 etc. but the highest single number is 1 010. The United States has a total of 3 168 somewhere.  Wait I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for the country with the highest gold medal count in any given year. Russia in 1980 had over 546 medals but how many were gold? Wait in one column under Russia there's a number like 28 and another at 546.  Wait no looking again the table has columns for different years or categories: for example maybe ""Totals"" is across all years. So perhaps each country's row shows their medal counts per year or overall.  Let me try to parse it more carefully. Each country's data seems to span multiple years from 1900 onwards. For Russia (RUS) under a column that says 28 maybe that's the number of gold medals in one particular year? Or is that the total across all years?  Wait looking at China Taipei their totals are 14 and 5 which probably don't make sense as they have fewer athletes. Looking back at the data I see that the United States has a total of 28 for some category but also much higher numbers elsewhere.  Wait maybe Russia is the country with the most Olympic gold medals. In the ""Totals"" row under Russia (RUS) there's a number like 6 and another at 546 which might be their total gold medals over time. The United States has totals around 3 168 in one column and much higher elsewhere.  Wait but I think I need to focus on the ""Totals"" row for each country. For example Russia's total is listed as 28 somewhere but then also a number like 546 in another column. Maybe that's incorrect because usually the highest number would be under ""Gold medals"" or similar.  Wait perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The user provided data where each row for a country includes various totals across different years or categories. So Russia has total gold medals of 546 in one year and 28 in another? That doesn't make sense because usually a country's medal count per year varies.  Wait maybe the numbers like 1 010 are total medals (gold + silver + bronze) but I'm not sure. Alternatively perhaps each number is for different events or sports.  Alternatively looking at the ""Totals"" row again: for Russia it shows 6 and 23 in some columns which might be total golds while having higher numbers elsewhere that include other medal types.  Wait no I think the ""Totals"" row sums up all their medals across different categories. So if we look at Russia (RUS) under one column it's 546 and another is 28 but perhaps those are totals in two different years or events.  But given that maybe the highest single-year total gold medal count by a country is from Russia with over 500 medals. However more accurately I know that the United States has won many Olympic gold medals possibly higher than Russia. But based on this data perhaps the totals show Russia leading.  Wait but looking at the numbers again: under Russia (RUS) in one column it's 28 and another is 546; elsewhere in ""Totals"" row for United States they have a number like 3 168. That seems too high because that would mean over 3 000 medals which doesn't make sense unless it's per event.  Wait perhaps the numbers are misaligned and each country's row includes multiple totals across different columns. So for Russia their gold medal total is in one column as 546 but another number like 28 might be a lower count in a specific year or category.  Alternatively maybe I'm misinterpreting the structure of the table. Each country has data from various years and categories so perhaps the highest single-year total for any country is Russia with over 500 medals. But that seems high because I know the U.S. has won many Olympic golds.  Wait in reality the U.S. has won more Olympic gold medals than Russia. Let me cross-check: historically the U.S. has had around 128 Olympic gold medals as of recent data while Russia has about 90-100. But perhaps this dataset is outdated or inaccurately presented.  Wait looking again at the data provided for each country:  For Russia (RUS) under ""Totals"" I see numbers like 546 and 28. Maybe that's incorrect because usually a country's total medals would be higher than individual entries in the table.  Alternatively perhaps each column represents different years or categories of participation so the highest number for any year is Russia with around 1 037 gold medals? Or maybe it's per event.  Wait I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should focus on which country has the highest number under their respective ""Totals"" rows.  Looking at the data:  - Russia (RUS): Totals are listed as 28 and 546; but perhaps elsewhere in their row there's a higher number like 1037. Wait no looking again: Each country's row has multiple numbers under different columns. For example under Russia (RUS) the columns include:  - 9 - 395 - 319 - 296 - 1 010  And also ""Totals"" as 28 and another at 546.  Wait perhaps those numbers are for different events or sports. For example in one event Russia might have won 395 gold medals which is unrealistic because that's a very high number.  Alternatively maybe the data is misaligned and each country's row lists their total medals across multiple years so the highest single-year medal count would be higher than any individual country's total.  Wait but given this confusion perhaps I should look for the country with the highest ""Totals"" in one of the columns. For example:  - China Taipei has totals as low as 14 and 5. - Poland (POL) has a total around 306. - United States has higher numbers like 28 and others but maybe their Totals are under 3 000.  Wait perhaps the ""Totals"" row for each country is just an overall summary. If that's the case then Russia (RUS) with a total of around 1 060 medals across all events might be higher than other countries.  But I'm not certain because the numbers don't add up in my mind. Alternatively maybe the correct answer based on this data is Russia.  Wait let me try to parse it differently. Each row for a country includes multiple entries under different columns. For example:  Under Russia (RUS) the data includes: - 9 - 395 - 319 - 296 - 1 010  And also ""Totals"" as 28 and 546.  Perhaps these are totals across different years or categories. So Russia's total is 546 in one category while their overall Totals might be higher elsewhere. But since the data isn't clear perhaps the answer intended here is that Russia has won over 100 Olympic gold medals.  But wait looking back at the ""Totals"" row under Russia (RUS) there's a number like 28 and another at 546 which might mean their total medals across all events are around 546. If that's the case then perhaps Russia has the highest total.  Alternatively if I look for the country with the highest individual medal count in any of the columns it could be higher than Russia.  Wait but given the data provided I think the intended answer is Russia because they have a high number like 546 medals and that might be their total across all events.  Based on the analysis of the provided data the country with the highest number of Olympic gold medals listed in one of the columns is Russia (RUS) with a total of **1 037** gold medals.

Question: when did the song things that make you go hmmm come out
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the song ""Things That Make You Go Hmmm"" came out. The context provided gives me some information about a song by C + C Music Factory called ""Things That Make You Go Hmmm..."". It was released on June 23 1991 as part of an album called ""Gonna Make You Sweat"".   Wait but the question is asking about ""Hmmm"" in lowercase. Hmm that's a bit tricky because sometimes song titles can have slight variations or typos. I remember reading somewhere that sometimes bands release slightly different versions with minor changes in spelling. So it's possible that both ""Hmmm..."" and ""Hmmmm..."" are versions of the same song.  Looking at the chronology provided:   - Here We Go (Let's Rock & Roll) - 1991 - Things That Make You Go Hmmm... - 1991 - Just a Touch of Love - 1991  Then another listing under 1991 for ""Just a Touch of Love"" again. Wait that might be a duplicate or maybe it's just how the context is laid out.  But focusing back on the main song in question: ""Things That Make You Go Hmmm..."" came out on June 23 1991. Since the user is asking about the version with ""Hmmm"" (without the trailing dot) but considering that the answer provided should be precise I need to confirm if both versions are from the same release.  I think in such cases it's safe to assume that both spellings refer to the same song because they were released together as part of the album. Therefore the original release date remains June 23 1991.  The song ""Things That Make You Go Hmmm"" was released on June 23 1991.", song things that make you go hmmm was released on june 23 1991,"June 23, 1991",0,0.375,3.258456399998977,0.0011337109952806509,0.00033288089151145637,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: how much does a new gulfstream g650 cost
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out how much a new Gulfstream G650 costs based on the context provided. Let me go through the information step by step.  First looking at the context it mentions that as of October 2017 the number built is over 260 units. That's a lot of planes but I'm not sure if that affects the cost directly.   Next there are two models mentioned: G650 and 650ER. The unit costs provided are $66.61 million for the G650 and $68.68 million for the 650ER. So since the question is about the Gulfstream G650 specifically I should focus on that figure.  I don't see any other information that would change this cost. The year ranges like ""Produced 2008 – present"" and the first flight date (November 25 2009) are more about production details rather than pricing.   So putting it all together the unit cost for a new Gulfstream G650 is $66.61 million as of October 2017.

Context: Since the late 1970s , the use of CFCs has been heavily regulated because of their destructive effects on the ozone layer . After the development of his electron capture detector , James Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air , finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC - 11 over Ireland . In a self - funded research expedition ending in 1973 , Lovelock went on to measure CFC - 11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic , finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected , and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment . The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere . The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who , after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock 's work , embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974 . It turns out that one of CFCs ' most attractive features -- their low reactivity -- is key to their most destructive effects . CFCs ' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years , giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere . Once in the stratosphere , the sun 's ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the C - Cl bond .

The problem here is that both Lovelock and Molina-Rood are mentioned as contributors to discovering the issue. However since Lovelock detected their presence starting in 1973 but didn't link it to environmental harm while Molina and Rowland connected CFCs to ozone damage in 1974.  So the problem of CFC's impact was discovered by Molina and Rowland in 1974. But Lovelock detected their presence earlier so maybe his work laid some groundwork but wasn't the discovery of the environmental impact.

Question: who is emma dating in once upon a time
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who Emma Swan is dating in ""Once Upon a Time."" Let me start by recalling the information given about Emma from the context provided.   From the context Emma is portrayed by Jennifer Morrison and she first appeared in the pilot episode and last appeared in ""A Pirate's Life."" Her role includes being a bail bond agent and a deputy before becoming the Sheriff. She has a family consisting of her father David Nolan (as Prince Charming) her mother Snow White (Mary Margaret Blanchard) and her brother Neal Nolan.   Looking at her relationships she is married to Killian Jones as of now. She's had a brief relationship with her ex-boyfriend Neal Cassidy before that. Additionally she has some other connections like Walsh but I don't think those are significant in terms of dating.  So putting this together Emma's current spouse is Killian Jones. She was previously in a relationship with Neal Cassidy and had others like Walsh who were ex-boyfriends or friends.   I should make sure there aren't any other significant relationships mentioned that might be considered as 'dating.' The context doesn't mention any other partners beyond her marriage to Killian and her past ones.  Therefore the answer is straightforward: Emma is dating Killian Jones.  Emma Swan is currently dating Killian Jones.",emma swan is currently dating killian jones,Hook,0,0.0,2.357128899995587,0.0008099815053713369,0.00023782724763029723,0.0,0.0,0.0

This further harmed the NIT 's prestige , both regionalizing interest in it and marginalizing it by reducing its association with Madison Square Garden .

Question: when did the ncaa tournament became more important than the nit
Answer: ",Alright I need to figure out when the NCAA Tournament became more important than the NIT. Let me look at the context provided.  The context mentions that in the early rounds the NIT moved away from Madison Square Garden starting in 1977. They started playing home games until later rounds. This action made the NIT lose prestige because it wasn't connected to MSG anymore. By the mid-80s the NIT transitioned to a secondary tournament for lesser teams.  Wait when did the NCAA Tournament start getting more attention? The context doesn't directly say that but maybe by 1977 after the NIT left Madison Square Garden the NCAA Tournament became more important. Because moving away from the iconic venue would take away its identity and draw more focus to the NCAA.  So putting it together: In 1977 the NIT left Madison Square Garden for home games but later switched to a secondary tournament. The NCAA Tournament's prominence likely increased when the NIT moved away as it became less associated with MSG.

Question: who is the first wife on sister wives
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the first wife was among Kody's ""sister wives."" From the context provided it talks about Kody having several marriages. The legal marriages are between him and his first wife Meri until their divorce in September 2014. After that he legally married Robyn in December 2014 to adopt her three children.  The other marriages mentioned are considered spiritual unions which I think means they might not have been legal marriages or maybe just less formal arrangements but the context doesn't specify that. It does mention that as of 2015 Kody had been married to Meri for 25 years Janelle for 22 Christine for 21 and Robyn for 5.  Now the question is asking who is the first wife on sister wives. I think ""sister wives"" refers to his first four wives: Meri Janelle Christine and Robyn. The only legal marriage before the others was with Meri so she would be considered the first wife in this context.

Question: list of local government area in benue state
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the list of local government areas (LGAs) in Benue State based on the context provided. Let me start by carefully reading through the given context.  The context lists a series of names separated by spaces and hyphens. It starts with ""Local Government Area Headquarters Ado Igumale"" followed by several names like Agatu Obagaji Apa Ugbokpo Buruku Buruku Gboko etc. I notice that some names repeat or have variations possibly indicating different LGAs within the state.  I should extract each unique name from this list to form the complete list of LGAs in Benue State. Let me go through them one by one:  1. Ado Igumale 2. Agatu 3. Obagaji 4. Apa Ugbokpo 5. Buruku 6. Buruku Gboko 7. Gboko 8. Gboko Guma 9. Gbajimba 10. Gwer East 11. Aliade (GbWest) 12. Gwer West 13. Naka 14. Katsina 15. Ala Katsina 16. Ala Konshisha 17. Tse - Agberagba 18. Kwande 19. Adikpo 20.

Others might be local government capitals or regions within the state.  I should cross-reference each name with known LGAs in Benue State to ensure accuracy. From my existing knowledge Benue State has several LGAs including Ado Igumale Agatu Obagaji Apa Ugbokpo Buruku Gboko Gbajimba Kwande Oga and others.  Wait I think I might have missed some. Let me check the context again more carefully. The list seems a bit extensive but not all names are LGAs; some could be local government capitals or regions within LGAs.  I should compile a list of LGAs from this context without duplications. For example Gboko appears multiple times so it's one LGA. Similarly Makurdi and Obi Makurdi might refer to the same area but as different LGAs? Or is Obi Makurdi another name for the same LGA?  I need to make sure I list each unique LGA only once even if listed multiple times in the context.

Question: where did the term hail mary in football come from
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the term ""hail Mary"" in football comes from. The question is asking specifically about its origin. From what I remember I've heard this term used when a team has run out of time and needs to score quickly like making an desperation throw or kick.  I think it's related to weather because hailstones are round and can hit you from the sky suddenly. Maybe the term was adopted from a metaphor in baseball? I recall something about the last out being a strike but wait no—that's baseball too. Or maybe it's from American football strategy where a team tries to get the ball back with a specific play.  Wait isn't ""hail Mary"" also used in other contexts like sports? Like basketball or soccer do they use similar terms for last-ditch efforts? Maybe not exactly. So focusing on football I think the term is derived from weather. Hail Mary passes are unexpected and sudden much like how hail can come out of nowhere.  I should check if this metaphor is about throwing something unexpected in a game situation. Yes it's when a team has no other options and needs to make an desperate throw or kick that could be intercepted or might not even reach the end zone. So the origin likely comes from the sudden nature of hailstones compared to regular rain.  The term ""hail Mary"" in football originates from weather metaphors referencing the sudden and unexpected nature of hail compared to steady rain used to describe a last-ditch desperate play.

Question: who does demetrius love in a midsummer night dream
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who Demetrius loves in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" Let me start by recalling what I know about the play. From the context provided Demetrius is one of the main characters and he has multiple romantic interests.  He claims to love Hermia because she's engaged to another Athenian named Theseus. But from the story it seems like Demetrius is actually using his love for Hermia as a ploy to get support from Duke Theseus and Egeus. So while he genuinely loves Hermia that's just part of his plan.  Then there's Lysander who Demetrius follows with Helena. But the context says that Demetrius doesn't actually love Lysander; instead he finds her annoying and a nuisance because she tries to win his heart. So here Demetrius is initially infatuated with Helena but doesn't reciprocate her feelings.  In the end Demetrius ends up falling for Helena not because of any romantic feelings but due to the magical influence of Oberon and Puck. They mix ""love juice"" in his eyes leading him to fall in love with Helena despite already disliking her.  So putting it all together: Demetrius loves Hermia (even though she's engaged) is infatuated with Lysander but doesn't return the feelings and later falls for Helena because of external forces. But according to the context provided the key point is that he eventually loves Helena.  In ""A Midsummer Night's Dream "" Demetrius loves:  1. **Hermia**: He claims to love her because she is engaged to Theseus but his main intention is to gain support for himself and Lysander.  2. **Helena**: Initially he finds her annoying and a nuisance but later falls in love with her after being influenced by Oberon and Puck who mix ""love juice"" into him.

Question: who played the twins in darling buds of may
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who played the twins in ""Darling Buds of May."" From what I remember this play was performed in May 2011 at Buss Farm. I think the main characters were Maryann and Daphne. They're twin sisters right? So probably they were portrayed by some famous actresses.  I'm trying to recall if it's a British production or if these women were from another country. Since it was in May 2011 maybe there have been other productions since then. But the context specifically mentions Buss Farm and this particular series put on in May 2011 so I should focus on that.  I think Maryann was played by someone like Emma Corrin because she's a well-known actress. Then Daphne might have been portrayed by another actress from the same generation or similar background. Maybe Claire Farrow? Wait no I'm not sure about her name. Or perhaps it was Sarah3? No that doesn't sound right.  Wait maybe the names are Emma Corrin and another actress whose last name I can't remember now. Let me think... Maybe she's a British actor known for this production. Oh perhaps it was Claire Farrow? No that might be a confusion with someone else. Alternatively could it have been Sarah3 as mentioned before?  Alternatively maybe the twins were played by two of the same actors because they looked alike or had similar features. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.  I think Emma Corrin was in this play playing Maryann. Then who was Daphne? Maybe another actress from a similar background. Perhaps Claire Farrow wasn't involved here but maybe someone else like Sarah3?  Wait perhaps the correct answer is Emma Corrin and Sarah3. But I'm not 100% certain about that. Alternatively could it be Emma Corrin and someone else entirely? Maybe she played one of them and another actress took on the other.  I should double-check my memory or try to piece together any clues from what I know. Since the context mentions Buss Farm in May 2011 perhaps looking up some information about that specific production might help but without access to external resources I have to rely on my existing knowledge.  So summarizing: Maryann was played by Emma Corrin and Daphne by another actress. The names are either Sarah3 or Claire Farrow. But since I'm not entirely sure about the second name maybe it's better to stick with Emma Corrin as one of them and perhaps someone else for the other twin.  Wait could it be that both twins were played by the same actor? That doesn't seem right because they are different people. So probably two different actresses: one for Maryann another for Daphne.  I think I'll go with Emma Corrin as Maryann and Claire Farrow as Daphne but I'm not entirely certain about her association with this production.

Context: It is produced in humans by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex within the adrenal gland . It is released in response to stress and low blood - glucose concentration . It functions to increase blood sugar through gluconeogenesis , to suppress the immune system , and to aid in the metabolism of fat , protein , and carbohydrates . It also decreases bone formation .
Question: where does cortisol come from in the body
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where cortisol comes from in the body. Let me start by recalling what I know about cortisol. I remember that it's a steroid hormone which means it's made by the adrenal glands. Specifically there are two main types of adrenal glands: the sympathetic and the parasympathetic.  The question mentions something called the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. I think the adrenal cortex is part of the outer layer of the adrenal gland. So the first step is that cortisol comes from the adrenal cortex within the adrenal gland. That makes sense because the question provided context about it being produced there.  Now why does it get released? The context says it's in response to stress and low blood glucose levels. Stress triggers the release probably through the fight-or-flight response activated by adrenaline. Low blood sugar would also prompt the body to produce more glucose which cortisol helps with by facilitating gluconeogenesis—turning non-sugar nutrients into glucose.  So putting this together: cortisol is produced in the adrenal gland's cortex when the body is stressed or has low blood sugar. This process happens through the adrenal glands' response to these stimuli.  Cortisol is produced in the adrenal gland specifically within the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. It is released in response to stress and low blood glucose levels.,cortisol is produced in adrenal gland specifically within zona fasciculata of adrenal cortex it is released in response to stress and low blood glucose levels,the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex within the adrenal gland,0,0.42424242424242425,2.308354799999506,0.0007942683495303978,0.00023321354153891773,0.0,0.0,0.0

Various other figures like Alessandro Achillini also contributed to the further understanding of the skeleton .
Question: what are the functions of the human skeleton
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out the functions of the human skeleton based on the provided context. Let's see... The context mentions that Leonardo Da Vinci studied anatomy but didn't publish his work. Antonio Pollaiuolo did some dissections too focusing mainly on muscles. Then there's Vesalius known as the father of modern anatomy who wrote ""De humani corporis fabrica"" with illustrations of the skeleton correcting Galen's theories.  So from this I know that the skeleton is part of Vesalius' work and he studied bone structures correcting some older ideas. The context doesn't explicitly list the functions but does imply understanding through dissections and correcting anatomical theories.  Typically the human skeleton has several key functions: support for the body protection of internal organs storage of minerals like calcium providing structural support for muscles during movement and contributing to blood circulation via its connection with tendons. The context supports the idea that da Vinci and others studied these aspects through their anatomical work.  So putting it all together the functions would include structure protection storage support for muscles and aiding in circulation.

Question: when did the study of media effects begin
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the study of media effects began based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that The New School University in New York has been studying the social impact of mass communication since its founding in 1919. It also notes that the first college course on motion pictures was offered in 1926. Then Marshall McLuhan's colleague John Culkin established the Center for Understanding Media at The New School in 1975. This led to the university offering a Master of Arts degree in Media Studies in 1975 as well.  Now I'm trying to find when the study of media effects began. From this information it seems that the earliest mention is from 1926 with the first college course on motion pictures. However considering that The New School has been involved in studying mass communication since 1919 which was its founding does that mean they started studying media effects then?  Wait the context says it's about the social impact of mass communication starting from 1919. So maybe the study began earlier than when the specific course on motion pictures was offered in 1926. However I don't have exact information on when the formal study or program started specifically. The first course was 1926 and prior to that they were conducting research since 1919.  I'm a bit confused because ""study of media effects"" could be interpreted as the initiation of specific programs or courses related to media impact analysis. Since the earliest mention is 1919 in general terms (social impact) but the first specific course on motion pictures was in 1926 I think the answer might relate to when they started a formal program.  Alternatively maybe the founding of the university in 1919 implies that their study began then. But since there's no exact date given for media studies starting specifically from 1919 perhaps it's safer to go with the earliest specific event mentioned which is the first course on motion pictures in 1926.  Wait but the question asks when the study of media effects began. If The New School has been studying mass communication since 1919 that would be earlier than 1926. So maybe the answer is that they started in 1919 with research and then had the first course in 1926.  But I'm not entirely sure if ""study of media effects"" refers to formal programs or just any research being conducted. Since the context doesn't specify when the study (program) began beyond mentioning it was established earlier perhaps the answer is that they started with research since 1919 and then formed a center in 1975.  Hmm I'm getting confused because the exact timeline isn't clear for the study of media effects specifically. The context mentions the first college course on motion pictures as part of their study in 1926 but prior to that they were conducting research since 1919 about mass communication's social impact.  I think I need to clarify whether the question is asking for when they started any kind of media-related study (since 1919) or specifically when a program was established. Since the first course was in 1926 that would be when they began formalizing their approach to studying media effects.  The study of media effects at The New School University began with formal programs in 1926 when the first college course on motion pictures was offered as part of their research into mass communication's social impact.", study of media effects at new school university began with formal programs in 1926 when first college course on motion pictures was offered as part of their research into mass communications social impact,1919,0,0.0,5.967023799996241,0.0021010806565371952,0.0006169205423578328,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when did the golden state warriors win the finals
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the Golden State Warriors won the NBA Finals. From what I remember they're a pretty successful team in recent years but I'm not exactly sure about all their championship wins.  The context provided mentions that the Warriors have reached nine NBA Finals and specifically won five championships. It lists those championships as 1947 1956 1975 2015 and 2017. Wait hold on I think they might have won more recently than that because I recall them winning back-to-back titles in 2015 and 2016 or something like that.  Looking at the context again: ""Golden State 's five NBA championships are tied for fourth-most in NBA history with the San Antonio Spurs  and behind only the Boston Celtics ( 17 )  Los Angeles Lakers ( 16 ) and Chicago Bulls ( 6 )."" So they have five championships. But when exactly did they win each one?  From my prior knowledge the Warriors won their first championship in 2015 against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Then a few months later they won another one in 2016 against the Houston Rockets or something like that. Wait but the context lists them as winning five so maybe I'm mixing up details.  Wait let me check: The context says they won five titles in 1947 1956 1975 2015 and 2017. So that's a span of more than seven decades. That seems a bit odd because I thought the Warriors had been around longer but perhaps their championship drought was significant.  But looking back at my initial response I think there might be confusion between 2015 and 2016 championships because they won both in consecutive years. However according to the context given the specific years are listed as five: 1947 1956 1975 2015 and 2017. Wait that can't be right because I thought they had back-to-back titles in recent years.  Wait a minute perhaps the context is correct but maybe the user meant to include more championships beyond those listed? Or maybe I misread it. Let me read again: ""Golden State 's five NBA championships are tied for fourth-most in NBA history with the San Antonio Spurs  and behind only the Boston Celtics ( 17 )  Los Angeles Lakers ( 16 ) and Chicago Bulls ( 6 ).""  So they have five championships but when? The context lists them as 1947 1956 1975 2015 and 2017. But I thought the Warriors won in 2015 and 2016 back-to-back. Maybe there's an error here.  Wait perhaps that was a different team? Or maybe it's a typo. Let me think: The 2015 title was against Cavaliers and 2016 against Rockets or Heat. So the context might have combined both into one mention but separately noted as two titles. Alternatively maybe the user is correct in stating five championships at specific years.  But regardless according to the context provided the Warriors won their NBA Finals in 1947 1956 1975 2015 and 2017. So I should list those as the years they won the NBA Finals.

Answer: ","Alright let's see. I need to figure out which Indian actor has won the most national awards based on the provided context.  First looking at the context it mentions several actors and their award counts.

The context says that as of 2017 Amitabh Bachchan is the most honored with four awards. Then it lists others who have won three times or twice.  But wait in the current day Riddhi Sen has just been awarded making him a recent winner. However considering that the question asks for ""which Indian actor has won most national awards "" I should check if there's an update beyond 2017.  Since the latest info is up to Riddhi Sen in 2023 perhaps he holds the record now with one award as of 2023. But that doesn't change the previous highest count.  Wait let me read again: ""As of 2017 Amitabh Bachchan is the most honoured actor with four awards."" So up to 2017 he has four. If Riddhi Sen got his award after that perhaps his total isn't more than four yet.  Therefore based on the provided context the highest number of awards is four by Amitabh Bachchan.

Question: the area enclosed by hysteresis loop is a measure of
Answer: ",Okay so I have this question about hysteresis loops and what their area measures. Let me think through this step by step.  First I remember that hysteresis refers to the lagging effect in systems like magnetic materials or ferromagnetic substances when they are subjected to cyclic changes like varying magnetic fields. The context mentions something about work done on the system when there's hysteresis with extensive and intensive variables. It says the area under the hysteresis graph represents that work.  So if I imagine a hysteresis loop it's typically drawn on a graph where one axis is the magnetic field (like B) and the other is magnetization (M). The loop starts at zero goes up to some maximum point when the field increases then back down as the field decreases and eventually returns to the origin. If there are any gaps or losses during this cycle that's where hysteresis comes in.  Now the area inside this loop would be enclosed by it. I'm trying to visualize this on a B vs M graph. The area is sort of like the space trapped within the loop itself. Since the context connects this area with work done maybe it's about energy?  In physics especially thermodynamics the area under a curve often represents some form of energy or work. For example in PV diagrams the area under the curve is work done by the system. Here since hysteresis involves cyclic processes perhaps the area represents the work done per cycle.  But wait what about the nature of the loop? Hysteresis implies that when you reverse the direction of an applied field or force there's a difference between the forward and return paths. This creates energy loss usually in the form of heat or other dissipated forms. So maybe this area is a measure of that energy loss.  Putting it all together: since work done on the system during hysteresis corresponds to the area under the graph which is enclosed by the loop I think the answer has to do with energy dissipation due to hysteresis.  The area enclosed by a hysteresis loop measures the energy dissipated per cycle due to hysteresis effects. This energy loss typically manifests as heat or other forms of energy dissipation when the system undergoes cyclic processes.  Answer: The energy dissipated per cycle due to hysteresis effects in the system., energy dissipated per cycle due to hysteresis effects in system,energy loss,0,0.16666666666666669,3.9927981999935582,0.0013968405614134605,0.0004101411500093721,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who plays nikko in the wizard of oz
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who plays the character Nikko in The Wizard of Oz. Let me start by recalling what I know about this movie. I remember that The Wizard of Oz is a classic 1939 animated film featuring a bunch of iconic characters like the Wicked Witch of the West Dorothy and her friends.  Now Nikko was one of the original voice actors for Toto right? Wait no that's not right. Toto is played by a real person who provided voice acting. The movie was directed by Frank Oz whose son is also named Frank Oz. I think I remember something about him being involved with the voice work.  Wait maybe Nikko wasn't in the original 1939 version? Because when I think of the character it's actually from a 1940 film called The Wizard and the Tin Woodman. That was made by Technicolor which is different from the 1939 version. So perhaps Nikko was added later because of this?  In the 1945 version which I believe is considered the ""classic"" version as seen in the context given (1979) the voice actors were changed. Frank Oz provided his voice for several roles that had been played by real people before like Toto and Nikko.  So putting this together: The original 1939 film didn't have Nikko; it was a different character. But in later versions especially the 1945 one the voice actors were updated. Frank Oz provided his voice for Nikko because he had already done it for Toto in an earlier version.  Wait but I'm getting confused now. Let me try to remember correctly: The Wizard of Oz originally was made as The Wizard and the Tin Woodman in 1940. Then in 1945 Technicolor produced a version where Wicked Witch is played by Frank Oz's mother Ethel and Toto is portrayed by Frank Oz himself. Then in 1968 another version came out with the original voice actors for Dorothy (Loretta Swit) and the Wicked Witch (Ethel). So Nikko was part of that.  Wait so maybe Nikko wasn't a character in the first 1939 film? Or was he included later? I think he might have been added in an early version before the 1945 one. So perhaps the original question is referring to the 1968 version where Nikko is played by someone else.  Wait no looking back at the context: The user provided (1941 1979 double-uncredited). Wait maybe I need to focus on that. But actually the user's question was about Nikko in The Wizard of Oz so perhaps they're referring to a specific version.  But wait I'm getting mixed up here. Let me think again: In 1945 Technicolor made the film with Frank Oz providing voices for Toto and probably others like the Wicked Witch (Ethel). Then Loretta Swit was added in later years as Dorothy's voice. So Nikko might have been portrayed by someone else but I'm not sure if he was part of an earlier version.  Alternatively perhaps Nikko wasn't actually a character in the 1939 film at all and was created much later for other versions. So maybe the answer is that Nikko's voice was provided by Frank Oz because he had done it before for Toto.  Wait but I'm not certain about this. Maybe I should check my facts again: In 1945 Technicolor made the film with Frank Oz as Toto and Ethel as the Wicked Witch. Then in later years Loretta Swit took over as Dorothy's voice and Frank Oz stayed for some roles.  So if Nikko was portrayed by someone else before perhaps he wasn't originally a character. So maybe in this context Nikko is played by Frank Oz because he had done it earlier.  Wait but the user asked specifically about Nikko so I think they're referring to the 1945 version where Nikko's voice was provided by someone else and later that was changed by Frank Oz for a different role. Or maybe Nikko wasn't in any of these versions and was added as part of an alternate timeline.  Wait perhaps it's better to state that in the 1968 Technicolor version Nikko is portrayed by Ethel but in another version he might be played by someone else or not at all. Alternatively maybe Nikko wasn't a real character and was just part of an alternate universe.  I'm getting confused now. Let me try to clarify:  - 1939: The Wizard of Oz (directed by Frank Oz's mother) - 1940: The Wizard and the Tin Woodman - 1945: Technicolor version with Ethel as Wicked Witch Loretta Swit as Dorothy Frank Oz as Toto. - 1968: Technicolor again with Loretta Swit's voice changed to Dorothy by Loretta Swit herself and Frank Oz remained for some roles.  Now Nikko wasn't a part of the original storyline; he was created in an alternate timeline for another version perhaps. So maybe in one version Nikko is portrayed by someone else but not necessarily connected to Frank Oz's role as Toto.  Wait no I think the key point is that in 1945 Technicolor made the film with Frank Oz as Toto and Ethel as Wicked Witch. Then in 1968 Loretta Swit took over as Dorothy but Frank Oz remained for other roles like Toto and maybe Nikko.  But I'm not sure about Nikko specifically. Maybe Nikko was part of an earlier version perhaps the 1940 one which wasn't animated by Technicolor. Or maybe he's a new character added in another timeline.  Alternatively perhaps the user is referring to the fact that in the 1968 version Nikko isn't portrayed as a separate character but was instead part of an alternate story with someone else taking his place hence being double-uncredited because it wasn't meant to be prominent.  Wait looking at the context provided: (1941 1979 double - uncredited). I'm not sure what that refers to. Maybe a different version or something else.  Alternatively perhaps the answer is that Nikko was portrayed by someone else in an earlier version and then changed later on but Frank Oz took over for other roles like Toto.  I think I've gone around enough. Let's try to sum it up: The Wizard of Oz had multiple versions including 1945 where Frank Oz provided voices for several characters including Toto. He may have also portrayed Nikko in a version that was later changed or added upon. However without specific information on Nikko's role in this context the most accurate answer is that in the 1968 Technicolor version Nikko wasn't a separate character but part of an alternate story hence being double-uncredited.  Wait no perhaps Nikko was portrayed by someone else entirely. Alternatively considering Frank Oz provided voices for Toto and other roles he might have done Nikko in the 1945 or later versions.  But I'm not certain about Nikko specifically. So to answer accurately perhaps it's best to say that in some version of The Wizard of Oz Nikko was portrayed by someone else but Frank Oz provided voices for other roles like Toto and possibly others.  In the 1968 Technicolor version of ""The Wizard of Oz "" Nikko was not a prominent character and was part of an alternate storyline. Therefore he wasn't portrayed as a separate character in that specific version.  Answer: In some versions of The Wizard of Oz Nikko was portrayed by different actors but specifically in the 1968 Technicolor version he was part of an alternate storyline without being a prominent character.",in some versions of wizard of oz nikko was portrayed by different actors but specifically in 1968 technicolor version he was part of alternate storyline without being prominent character,Patrick Walshe,0,0.0,13.131032100005541,0.004663953675563541,0.0013694328307236648,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when did the isle of wight become an island
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the Isle of Wight became an island. The context provided mentions that during the last Ice Age sea levels were lower and the Solent was part of a river flowing southeast from Poole Harbour towards mid-Channel. Then as sea levels rose the river valley got flooded and the chalk ridge line west of the Needles breached to form the island.  Hmm so it sounds like the sea level rising caused changes in the landscape. The Solent was a river that's now part of the sea but when the sea was lower maybe this area was part of a larger river system or lower lying land. As the sea rose and flooded areas perhaps the existing geographical features changed.  The context says that the ridge line west of the Needles breached to form the island. So breaching would mean breaking through right? That probably refers to the ridge or hill there being cut through by the sea allowing it to emerge as an island. If the sea level rose enough for this to happen then the island was formed.  I'm not entirely sure about the timeline here. The last Ice Age is mentioned so perhaps the changes happened around that time? But I think the last Ice Age ended around 10 000 years ago when temperatures started rising again. However the exact timing of when the ridge breached into an island would depend on when sea levels rose sufficiently.  I'm not a geologist but I know that such landform changes can take thousands of years. So maybe it happened as part of the late stages of the last Ice Age or after the ice melted.

Question: what part of maryland is close to washington dc
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out which part of Maryland is close to Washington D.C. based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that the Washington metropolitan area is centered on Washington D.C. and includes parts of Maryland and Virginia as well as a small portion of West Virginia. It also mentions that St. Mary's County isn't part of the Washington metropolitan area but is part of another nearby area with Baltimore.  So focusing on Maryland the context mentions ""parts of the U.S. states of Maryland and Virginia."" That tells me that both these states are included in the metropolitan area around Washington. Since the question specifically asks about Maryland I can conclude that parts of Maryland are indeed close to Washington D.C.  I don't see any specific regions mentioned beyond just the general inclusion of Maryland and Virginia into the metropolitan area. Therefore without more detailed information from the context it's reasonable to infer that all parts of Maryland within the metropolitan area would be close to Washington D.C.

Question: when does a building need a fire pump
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when a building in India needs a fire pump. From the context given it mentions that fire-fighting pumps are installed based on certain standards. The relevant document here is IS 15301 published by the Bureau of Indian Standards.  Looking at the question again: ""When does a building need a fire pump?"" I think the answer would be about the circumstances under which a building requires a fire pump. From what I know buildings that are prone to fire hazards like those in high-risk areas or industries with flammable materials might need fire pumps.  But from the context provided it specifically says that IS 15301 is followed throughout India for installation and maintenance of fire-fighting pumps. So maybe the answer relates to the presence of fire risks and compliance with this standard.  I should also consider other factors like the type of building or its location.

Question: interferons alpha and beta are effective against viruses
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out if interferons alpha and beta are effective against viruses based on the given context. Let me start by looking at the context provided. It's a list of genes related to interferons including IFNA1 through several entries like IFNA13 IFNB1 etc.  I remember that interferons are a type of cytokine used in medicine and biology to fight viral infections. There are different types such as alpha beta gamma etc. each with specific roles. But the question here is about alpha and beta specifically.  Looking at the context again it just lists genes without any additional information or explanations. So I don't see any mention of interferons by name only their gene identifiers (IFNA1 IFNA2 etc.). Since the user provided this list but didn't include details on what each interferon does I can't directly conclude from the context whether alpha and beta are effective against viruses.  Wait maybe interferons work by signaling in the immune system. Alpha and beta interferons might have different mechanisms or targets. But without specific data it's hard to say if they're effective based solely on this list.  I think the best approach is to rely on general knowledge about interferons. I recall that alpha interferon (α-IFN) is known for inducing cellular immune responses and has been used in treating viral infections like hepatitis B. Beta interferon (β-IFN) also contributes to immune response but might have different applications or effects.  Since the context doesn't provide direct information perhaps I should assume based on general knowledge that interferons alpha and beta do play roles against viruses making them effective in certain treatments.  Interferons alpha and beta are known to be effective against viral infections as they contribute to immune responses.   Answer: Interferons alpha (α-IFN) and beta (β-IFN) are effective against certain viral infections such as hepatitis B by inducing immune responses.,interferons alpha αifn and beta βifn are effective against certain viral infections such as hepatitis b by inducing immune responses,"IFN-α can be used to treat hepatitis B and C infections, while IFN-β can be used to treat multiple sclerosis",0,0.20000000000000004,3.294991699993261,0.0011505921230601929,0.0003378375382127452,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who played the female lead in the 1942 film casablanca
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who played the female lead in the 1942 film Casablanca. Let me start by recalling what I know about the movie based on the context provided.  The context mentions that the film is a 1942 American romantic drama directed by Michael Curtiz. It's based on a play by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison which wasn't produced as a stage play. The main stars listed are Humphrey Bogart Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid. So looking at that list the female leads would be Ingrid Bergman or perhaps another actress mentioned.  Wait but the context also mentions that Claude Rains Conrad Veidt Sydney Greenstreet Peter Lorre and Dooley Wilson are featured in the film. None of these names are female except maybe Sydney Greenstreet? No wait Sydney Greenstreet is male as well. So Ingrid Bergman must be the female lead since she's one of the main stars listed alongside Humphrey Bogart.  I think Ingrid Bergman played a significant role in this movie because I remember her being prominent in films from that era. The plot involves an American expatriate which likely refers to Humphrey Bogart as he was known for playing such roles. So the female lead is Ingrid Bergman.

The series ' success catapulted such long - running cast members as Pompeo , Dempsey , and Oh to worldwide recognition ; they were among the top five highest - earning television actors in 2013 .
Question: how many seasons has greys anatomy been on tv
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out how many seasons Grey's Anatomy has been on TV. From what I remember the context provided says that they renewed it for a fourteenth season starting in 2017. But wait when did the first season air? I'm not entirely sure about that.  Let me think. I know that Grey's Anatomy is a long-running show so it must have had multiple seasons before 2017. If the fourteenth season was renewed in 2017 does that mean they started counting from the beginning? Or maybe the first season was in an earlier year.  I'm trying to recall if I've heard that Grey's Anatomy has been on TV since like 1995 or something. Let me try to break it down. If Season 14 premiered in September 2017 then the previous seasons would have been up to Season 13 before that. So adding all those up.  Wait but I'm not sure about the exact start year. If the fourteenth season is Season 14 then they must have started from Season 1. But how many years does that cover?  If Season 14 is in 2017 and assuming each season is roughly a year apart (though some seasons might span two years) but I think each season is typically one year.  So if Season 14 was in 2017 then the first season would have been around 1995. Let me check that math: 2017 minus 13 years (since Season 14 would be 14 seasons starting from 1) gives us 2017 - 13 = 1994 but since the first season started in 1995 maybe it's a bit different.  Wait perhaps each season starts around September. So if Season 14 premiered in September 2017 then Season 1 was probably in 1995 or 1996. Let me add up the seasons: from Season 1 to Season 14 would be 14 seasons over how many years?  If each season is roughly a year apart then it's about 13 years between Season 1 and Season 14. So if Season 14 was in 2017 Season 1 would have been around 2017 - 13 = 2004? Wait that doesn't seem right because I thought the first season was earlier.  I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should think about it differently. If Season 14 is in 2017 and each season is one year apart then the first season would have been around 2017 - 13 = 2004? But that still feels off because Grey's Anatomy has a longer history.  Wait I think the correct approach is to realize that since Season 14 was renewed in February 2017 (the context says it was renewed on February 10 2017) and then it premiered in September 2017. So from Season 1 to Season 13 would have been up until around 2016.  If Season 14 is the latest one then they've had Season 1 through Season 14 which makes 14 seasons total. So regardless of when each season started exactly the count remains 14.

Question: is coca cola a public or private company
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out whether Coca-Cola is a public or private company. Let me start by recalling what I know about these terms. A public company is one whose shares are traded on stock exchanges meaning the general public can buy and sell their shares through brokers. These companies report their earnings have board members and undergo various regulations.  On the other hand a private company doesn't have its shares publicly traded. Their ownership might be held by a few individuals or families without transparency for the public. Private companies typically don't have to go through the same reporting requirements as public ones.  Now Coca-Cola is a well-known beverage company. I remember that major corporations like this are usually public companies because they need to manage their financials and share information with investors. Coca-Cola has been around for a long time so it's unlikely to be private anymore. Also companies that undergo an IPO (Initial Public Offering) or have stock exchanges involved are definitely public.  I think I've heard before that Coca-Cola is listed on stock exchanges like the NYSE which would make sense if they're public. Private companies might operate in different sectors but wouldn't typically be as visible in mainstream markets unless they're very small.  So putting it all together Coca-Cola must be a public company because of its market capitalization and the fact that their shares are traded publicly.  Coca-Cola is a public company because its shares are traded on stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) indicating its ownership is accessible to the public through brokers.,cocacola is public company because its shares are traded on stock exchanges such as new york stock exchange nyse indicating its ownership is accessible to public through brokers,Public,0,0.0689655172413793,2.6248751999955857,0.0009037098165168973,0.00026534780966407524,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who wrote from now on from the greatest showman
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who wrote for ""The Greatest Showman"" after looking at the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.  Okay the context mentions several people involved in the production of the movie. It lists the director as Michael Gracey and the producer as Laurence Mark Peter Chernin. Then there's Jenno Topping. The screenwriter is listed as Jenny Bicks with Bill Condon also contributing to the story.  Looking at the question it asks who wrote from now on. ""From now on"" typically refers to the script or screenplay. Since ""The Greatest Showman"" is a musical songs would have been written by lyricists and composers. The context doesn't explicitly state the names of the lyricists or composers but in many cases the director might handle that role.  Wait the context mentions the music was composed by John Debney and Joseph Trapanese. So they are responsible for the songs' melodies but lyrical content is usually handled separately. However the question asks who wrote from now on which could imply both lyricists and composers since it's a musical.  But in the context provided there's no specific mention of lyricists or additional composers beyond what's already listed as music. So maybe the answer includes the screenwriter for the story and John Debney for the composition of songs.  Putting this together the people involved after the initial credits would be Jenny Bicks (screenplay) and John Debney (music). Therefore the writers from now on are these two individuals.  The writers from now on in ""The Greatest Showman"" include Jenny Bicks as the screenwriter and John Debney as the composer of the musical numbers.

Context: In common everyday speech , speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air . However , the speed of sound varies from substance to substance : sound travels most slowly in gases ; it travels faster in liquids ; and faster still in solids . For example , ( as noted above ) , sound travels at 343 m / s in air ; it travels at 1,484 m / s in water ( 4.3 times as fast as in air ) ; and at 5,120 m / s in iron ( about 15 times as fast as in air ) . In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond , sound travels at 12,000 metres per second ( 26,843 mph ) ; ( about 35 times as fast as in air ) which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions .
Question: where does sound travel fastest solid liquid or gas
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where sound travels the fastest among solids liquids and gases. From what I remember the speed of sound varies depending on the medium it's traveling through. I think in gases like air sound moves slower because those mediums are less dense. On the other hand solids are denser so sound should move faster there.  Let me break it down. I know that in air which is a gas sound travels at about 343 meters per second. Then when comparing to liquids like water where sound can go over four times as fast as in air—so around 1 484 m/s. Solids are even faster; for example iron has sound traveling at 5 120 m/s.  So putting that together: gases move the slowest then liquids and solids the fastest.

Question: what does aa on a license plate mean
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out what ""AA"" means on a license plate. Let me start by going through the context provided.  First it mentions that both the Netherlands and Portugal use three groups of two characters each in their license plates. These can be combinations like AB - 12 - CD with various arrangements. So there are multiple formats possible.  Now focusing on the specific question about ""AA."" The context says something about 'AA' being reserved for cars of the royal family in the Netherlands. That's a significant point because it means that while other letters might be used 'AA' has a special purpose here.  Additionally the context talks about newer plates using only consonants to avoid abbreviations or words. However since 'AA' is specifically mentioned as reserved for the royal family I should pay attention to that detail rather than just focusing on consonants.  So putting this together ""AA"" isn't a general purpose code but is instead exclusively used by the Royal Family. Therefore when someone sees ""AA"" on a Dutch license plate they can infer it's related to royalty.

Question: what are the titles of a board of directors
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out the question the user is asking. They provided some context about gender representation in corporate boards mentioning governments and corporations taking action through legislation. There's also a study from France that looks at social class distribution on boards.  Wait looking closer at the question again: ""what are the titles of a board of directors."" Hmm maybe they're not asking for job titles but rather what official roles or positions exist in a corporate board.

Wait no reading again: The user provided the context first then asked ""what are the titles of a board of directors"" and gave an answer listing specific positions. So I think they might be asking for confirmation or more information on those titles mentioned earlier like Chairman Independent Board Members etc. rather than related to gender representation.

Question: who was president when the panama canal was built
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who was president when the Panama Canal was built. Let me start by recalling what I know from the context provided.  The question mentions the Panamanian government's actions after the Hay-Herrán Treaty in 1903. Bunau-Varilla told Roosevelt about a possible revolt by Panamanian rebels aiming for independence from Colombia. Roosevelt then changed tactics using the Mallarino-Bidlack Treaty of 1846 as part of his strategy.  After Panama separated from Colombia Theodore Roosevelt became the president of the United States in January 1905. He was re-elected the next year. So he must have been president when the canal was built because that's around the time it started construction with U.S. support.  Wait did he serve during the building?

While the entire rib section comprises ribs six through 12 , a standing rib roast may contain anywhere from two to seven ribs .
Question: where does prime rib come from on a cow
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the prime rib comes from on a cow. The user provided some context about standing rib roasts and mentions that they're part of the primal rib cut of beef. I remember that primal cuts are specific parts of an animal that are considered quality or tenderness grades for beef.  The context says the primal rib is one of the nine primal cuts along with others like sirloin and Porterhouse. It also notes that a standing rib roast can have anywhere from two to seven ribs from the entire rib section (ribs six through twelve). So prime rib must be referring specifically to these particular ribs.  I think each cow has several ribs. The context mentions ribs six through twelve being part of the primal rib cut so those are probably where the prime rib comes from. Ribs in general are important for the backbone and internal organs but for beef cuts like prime rib they're cut off because they provide the desired texture.  So putting it together the prime rib must come from ribs six through twelve on a cow.  The prime rib comes from ribs six through twelve of a cow.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who enforces the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. From what I remember in class our legal system uses courts to interpret and enforce laws. The context given mentions that the Supreme Court of Canada is the ultimate authority on this matter. So it's likely related to them.  Wait the question specifically asks about who enforces it. So maybe besides being the interpreting body they also have the power to enforce it through legal actions like lawsuits or interpretations in court cases. That makes sense because if the Supreme Court says something is under the Charter other courts might follow that ruling as a guideline for enforcement.

Context: In August 1963 , 22 - year old folksinger Joan Baez , led a crowd of 300,000 in singing `` We Shall Overcome '' at the Lincoln Memorial during A. Philip Randolph 's March on Washington . President Lyndon Johnson , himself a Southerner , used the phrase `` we shall overcome '' in addressing Congress on March 15 , 1965 , in a speech delivered after the violent , `` Bloody Sunday '' attacks on civil rights demonstrators during the Selma to Montgomery marches , thus legitimizing the protest movement .
Question: who validated the civil rights movement by proclaiming we shall overcome
Answer: ","Okay so I have this question about the civil rights movement and who validated it by saying ""we shall overcome."" Let me try to break this down.   First from what I remember in history class there were some important events related to the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S. especially around the 1960s. The Lincoln Memorial is a significant spot in Washington D.C. and I think it's where many notable speeches happened.  The question mentions Joan Baez leading a crowd of 300 000 people singing ""We Shall Overcome"" at the Lincoln Memorial during A. Philip Randolph's March on Washington in August 1963. So that was one person who spoke those words and validated the movement by that song.  Then there's President Lyndon Johnson a Southerner himself who used the same phrase ""we shall overcome"" in his speech on March 15 1965. He delivered this after the ""Bloody Sunday"" attacks during the Selma to Montgomery marches. His use of the phrase was meant to legitimize the protest movement.  So the question is asking who validated it by proffering that specific phrase. The answer includes both Joan Baez and Lyndon Johnson because they both used ""we shall overcome."" However since the question might be looking for one person primarily I should clarify which one directly validated through song versus through speech.  Wait actually Joan Baez's version was performed at the March on Washington which was in August 1963. Lyndon Johnson used it later in his address after the attacks in 1965. So both played significant roles in validating the movement but perhaps the answer is expecting both names to be mentioned.  I think I should structure my response to include both individuals since they each contributed to the movement's validation through their respective statements.  Joan Baez and Lyndon Johnson both validated the civil rights movement by proclaiming ""we shall overcome."" Joan Baez sang it at the March on Washington in 1963 while Lyndon Johnson used the phrase in his speech after the Bloody Sunday events.",joan baez and lyndon johnson both validated civil rights movement by proclaiming we shall overcome joan baez sang it at march on washington in 1963 while lyndon johnson used phrase in his speech after bloody sunday events,President Lyndon Johnson,0,0.1,3.5543535000033444,0.0012488236162718496,0.0003666803272223932,0.0,0.0,0.0

The simulcast marked the game 's return to broadcast television , as well as its return to ABC for the first time since 2003 . To accommodate the return to broadcast television , the game moved from primetime to an afternoon start time to avoid interfering with ABC 's Primetime Lineup .
Question: where's the pro bowl going to be this year
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the Pro Bowl is going to be this year based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that in 2018 the Pro Bowl was televised nationally by ABC ESPN and ESPN Deportes. It also mentioned that this simulcast marked the game's return to broadcast television and its return to ABC for the first time since 2003. To make it fit into the broadcast schedule the game moved from primetime to an afternoon start time to avoid interfering with ABC's Primetime Lineup.  Hmm though the context is about 2018 I'm supposed to answer where it's going this year which I assume is the current year or the next one. But wait maybe the user is asking in general for the location of the Pro Bowl each year? Or perhaps they're referring to a specific upcoming event.  Wait but looking at the context again it only talks about 2018's Pro Bowl. So I don't have information on where it was held that year or in previous years from this context. Therefore with the given information I can't determine where it's going this year because the context doesn't mention any specific location.  I should probably respond by stating that there isn't enough information provided to answer where the Pro Bowl is scheduled for this year based on the given text.  The context provided does not contain information about the current or upcoming years' locations for the Pro Bowl. Therefore I cannot determine where it will be held this year.

The group officially disbanded after the Stamp Act was repealed . However , the name was applied to other local separatist groups during the years preceding the American Revolution .
Question: the sons of liberty who were they and what did they do
Answer: ",Okay I need to answer the question about the Sons of Liberty. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.  The context mentions that the Sons of Liberty was an organization created in the Thirteen American Colonies. It was a secret society aiming to protect colonist rights against British taxes. They were involved in fighting the Stamp Act in 1765 which is a key tax imposed by Britain. The group officially stopped existing after the Stamp Act was repealed but their name was also used for other local groups before the American Revolution.  So putting this together I can outline what they were and what they did:  1. They were founded in the Thirteen Colonies. 2. Served as a secret society to protect against British taxes. 3. Actively fought the Stamp Act in 1765. 4. Disbanded after the Stamp Act was repealed. 5. The name was also used by other groups during the lead-up to the American Revolution.

Question: when is if loving you is wrong coming back season 4
Answer: ","Alright so I'm trying to figure out when ""If Loving You Is Wrong"" Season 4 is coming back. The context provided includes a list of episodes with titles and air dates from Season 4. Each entry has the episode number in the series the title the original air date and U.S. viewers in millions.  Looking through the data I see that the episodes are numbered up to 82 and the last one is ""Behind Enemy Lines"" which aired on March 7 2018. There's no mention of Season 4 continuing beyond this point. Each subsequent episode after number 80 goes into 2018 with the last being in March.  Since there are only 82 episodes listed and none marked as a continuation or a season finale indicating a return it seems that the series has concluded its fourth season by the end of March 2018. Without any additional information about future seasons I can't find an indication of when Season 5 would air.  Therefore based on the provided context ""If Loving You Is Wrong"" Season 4 does not appear to be returning beyond what's already listed.  The context provided does not indicate that ""If Loving You Is Wrong"" Season 4 is returning. The last episode listed is from March 2018 and there are no mentions of future seasons or continuation episodes.

954,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: The geocentric ( Ptolemaic ) model of the solar system is still of interest to planetarium makers , as , for technical reasons , a Ptolemaic - type motion for the planet light apparatus has some advantages over a Copernican - type motion . The celestial sphere , still used for teaching purposes and sometimes for navigation , is also based on a geocentric system which in effect ignores parallax . However this effect is negligible at the scale of accuracy that applies to a planetarium .
Question: who is credited with developing the geocentric view
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who is credited with developing the geocentric view. From what I remember the question refers to Ptolemy's model because it mentions a Ptolemaic-type motion in the context. So Ptolemy probably developed this geocentric system.  Wait but isn't there also Aristotle? I think he proposed that Earth was at the center and other celestial bodies moved around it but wasn't he just one of many who thought that way before him?  Then there's Aristarchus who supposedly had a heliocentric model which is the opposite. But since the question is about geocentrism Ptolemy makes more sense because his system was detailed and comprehensive.  So putting it together: Ptolemy developed the geocentric model that became the basis for planetariums despite later models like Copernicus's heliocentrism being more accurate. Therefore the answer is Ptolemy.  Ptolemy,ptolemy,Ptolemy,1,1.0,1.8117755999992369,0.0006181943062554192,0.00018151457703968727,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who was the voice of templeton in charlotte's web
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who the voice of Templeton is in Charlotte's Web. Let me start by going through the context provided.   Looking at each character description I see that Templeton is described as ""Templton "" played by Paul Lynde. So right off the bat I can tell that Paul Lynde is the actor playing this character.  Wait a second the question mentions Charlotte's Web but then refers to Templeton in the context of Charlotte's Web and its sequel. In the original Charlotte's Web the main characters are Wilbur Charlotte (Cavatica) and Homer. The sequel would include other characters like Jeffrey and Lurvy. But the question is about Templeton who isn't in Charlotte's Web but appears later in the story.  Wait no actually looking back at the context provided: Paul Lynde as Templeton a rat who joins Homer's farm. He dies with four children at the end of his story and then again in the sequel. So Templeton is part of the extended family tree beyond Charlotte's Web but included when she's telling her story.  But since Charlotte's Web is about Homer Wilbur and Charlotte Templeton isn't a main character there. However in the given context for Charlotte's Web (and its sequel) we have that Paul Lynde voices Templeton who is part of the ending specifically when he's at the end of his story with his children.  So putting this together the voice actor for Templeton would be Paul Lynde as stated in his character description. The question doesn't specify whether it's during Charlotte's Web or after but since Templeton isn't in the original Charlotte's Web narrative I think the answer refers to him being part of that extended ending.  The voice of Templeton in Charlotte's Web is Paul Lynde.  Answer: Paul Lynde",paul lynde,Paul Lynde,1,1.0,3.2288254000013694,0.0011318833462238078,0.00033234425611677063,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: who was the successful commanding general of the northern forces in the civil war
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out who the successful commanding general of the northern forces during the Civil War was based on the provided context. The context mentions a speech by Major General McClellan at West Point regarding the Battle Monument's dedication.  First I know that the Union forces in the Civil War were led by several key generals. One of them is Robert E. Lee but he was more famous for leading the Confederate forces so probably not him since we're talking about northern forces.  Another prominent figure is Ulysses S. Grant. He was a Union general and the commander of the U.S. Army during much of the war. Grant led significant battles like Chancellorsville and then his promotion to General was a big deal because he was one of the few who stayed loyal to the Union after the initial secession.  The context specifically mentions McClellan's speech but I don't recall him being the highest-ranking general in the Union during the war. He was a capable leader but maybe not as high up or prominent as Grant.  So putting this together it seems like Ulysses S. Grant was the successful general leading the northern forces because of his strategic roles and the battles he won.  Ulysses S.

Question: what is the spelling of lakh in english
Answer: ","Alright I need to figure out how to answer the question about the spelling of ""lakh"" in English. From the context provided it's clear that ""lakh"" comes after a number and refers to a specific amount.  Looking at the examples given: ""1 lakh people "" ""200 lakh rupees "" etc. I can see that ""lakh"" is used as an adjective modifying a noun like ""people"" or ""rupees."" So it's acting like a multiplier word rather than a standalone unit of measurement.  The user is asking for the spelling in English. The context mentions ""5 lakh of rupees "" which breaks down into ""5"" and ""lakh."" Here ""lakh"" itself doesn't have an 's' appended to it so its singular form must be ""lakh.""  I should also check if there's a plural form or another way to express larger numbers. The context mentions that 100 lakh is called one crore which equals ten million. That tells me that ""lakh"" is part of the Indian numbering system and doesn't have an 's' in its spelling.  So putting it all together since ""lakh"" isn't pluralized here and serves as a multiplier without changing form the correct spelling remains ""lakh.""  The spelling of lakh in English is **lakh**.", spelling of lakh in english is lakh,lakh,0,0.25,2.3131201999931363,0.0008067927118383207,0.00023689095219121698,0.0,0.0,0.0

It's more focused on the number of licensed premises and their types with 24-hour licenses. There's no mention of any department responsible for these forums elsewhere in the provided text.  So if I have to answer based only on this context it seems like there's no information given about who establishes the local licensing forums.

Context: The third cause of this extinction event that can be attributed to northern Pangaea is the beginnings of anoxic ocean environments , or oceans with very low oxygen concentrations . The mix of anoxic oceans and ocean acidification due to metal loading led to increasingly acidic oceans , which ultimately led to the extinction of Benthos .
Question: what was the name of the first continent
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the name of the first continent based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions something about northern Pangaea and causes of an extinction event. It talks about three causes but specifically points out two factors: anoxic ocean environments and ocean acidification due to metal loading. These factors led to increasingly acidic oceans resulting in the extinction of Benthos.  Hmm Pangaea is a term I've heard before. Isn't Pangaea related to the supercontinent? I think Pangaea was the name given by Eratosthenes for what we now know as the entire continent that includes all seven continents today. So if it's called Pangaea then when it broke apart into smaller continents those would be parts of Pangaea.  Wait but the question is about the name of the first continent. Pangaea was the supercontinent before it split so maybe the answer is Pangaea itself.  The name of the first continent according to the context is Pangaea.

Question: who owns the rights to rocky and bullwinkle
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who owns the rights to ""Rocky and Bullwinkle."" Let me go through the context provided step by step.  First it mentions that the show remained in syndication up until 2016. Then specifically WBBZ-TV aired it during the summer of 2013 to counterprogram the 10 PM newscasts in Buffalo New York. After that I see that the rights are now owned by Universal Pictures.  Universal Pictures holds the library of two companies: DreamWorks Animation and Classic Media. Then there's a joint venture called Bullwinkle Studios which includes copyright holders Ward Productions and Classic Media. It also notes that Universal bought Classic Media at the same time The Program Exchange shut down.  Putting this together it seems like the ownership structure is as follows: Universal Pictures owns the current rights and they acquired Classic Media to get those rights. Bullwinkle Studios operates the properties under this ownership.

Context: A typical explanation found in the scientific literature for the evolution of light hair is related to the evolution of light skin , and in turn the requirement for vitamin D synthesis and northern Europe 's seasonal less solar radiation . Lighter skin is due to a low concentration in pigmentation , thus allowing more sunlight to trigger the production of vitamin D. In this way , high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation , which reduces the prevalence of rickets caused by vitamin D deficiency . The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the Inuit is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in , because in the polar climate there is more ice or snow on the ground , and this reflects the solar radiation onto the skin , making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond , brown or red hair , light skin and blue , grey or green eyes .
Question: where does blonde hair green eyes come from
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where blonde hair and green eyes come from based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context talks about the evolution of light hair in northern Europe because they have less solar radiation due to their latitude. Lighter skin allows more sunlight to trigger vitamin D production which helps prevent rickets. It also mentions that darker pigmentation is associated with certain ethnic groups like the Inuit who eat more seafood and live in polar climates where there's more ice or snow reflecting solar radiation.  Wait so the context explains light hair but not blonde specifically. It says that in northern latitudes high frequencies of light hair are due to low sunlight and thus less vitamin D needs leading to lighter skin. But why would someone have blonde hair? The context doesn't mention blonde explicitly; it only refers to light hair.  Similarly for eyes the context mentions that certain groups like the Inuit in polar climates end up with blue grey or green eyes because of their environment. It talks about darker pigmentation but not specifically about eye color variations beyond those traits.  So from this information alone I can't find a direct explanation for blonde hair and green eyes. The context doesn't provide specific reasons why someone would have blonde hair or particularly green eyes. It mainly discusses light skin and less solar radiation affecting hair pigment levels but doesn't delve into the specifics of eye color beyond mentioning some possible outcomes in polar regions.  Therefore based on this context alone there's no information provided about the origin of blonde hair and green eyes.  Based on the provided context there is no direct explanation for why blonde hair or green eyes are present. The discussion focuses on light skin pigmentation influenced by environmental factors but does not elaborate specifically on eye color variations like blue grey or green.,based on provided context there is no direct explanation for why blonde hair or green eyes are present discussion focuses on light skin pigmentation influenced by environmental factors but does not elaborate specifically on eye color variations like blue grey or green,a low concentration in pigmentation,0,0.04347826086956521,3.0849561000068206,0.001072138841040771,0.0003148020392457797,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: where does the song 10 green bottles come from
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the song ""10 Green Bottles"" comes from. The user provided some context about words like ""standing "" ""sitting "" and ""hanging"" sometimes being used interchangeably. Also it mentions that various versions of the lyrics exist many of which are vulgar or satirical.  Hmm so I know that ""10 Green Bottles"" is a pretty common children's song. I think it's often sung to the tune of ""Oh Susannah."" But where exactly did it originate? The context talks about the words being substituted but that might relate more to versions rather than the origin.  I recall that many folk songs have been around for a long time without specific attributions because they were passed down through generations. Maybe ""10 Green Bottles"" doesn't have an author's name attached to it? It was probably created in a community or culture where these types of traditional songs thrive.  Also considering the context about vulgar versions existing perhaps different cultures or regions have their own adaptations of this song over time. But back to the origin—where did the song first appear?  I think I've heard that ""10 Green Bottles"" is an older folk song without a known original author. It might have been part of an oral tradition in places like New England or Ireland given its structure and content.  Wait but does it have any historical significance? Maybe it predates the 20th century so it could be several decades old before being documented. Therefore tracing its origin might not pinpoint a specific individual author but rather trace it back through generations without knowing who exactly passed it on.  So putting this together I think ""10 Green Bottles"" is an anonymous folk song from an unspecified origin likely from early 20th-century America or Europe.  The song ""10 Green Bottles"" is an anonymous folk song that originated in the early 20th century in regions like New England or Ireland. It does not have a known original author and was part of an oral tradition passed down through generations without specific attribution.

Question: who played the original wonder woman on tv
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who played Wonder Woman in the first season of the TV show based on DC Comics. The context provided mentions that Lynda Carter is known from seasons 2 and 3 as Wonder Woman but it's clear she's playing a different version because her name isn't capitalized as Wonder Woman there. Season 1 was titled ""Wonder Woman"" and was set in the 1940s during WWII. The cast included Lyle Waggoner as Steve Trevor Sr. & Jr.  Wait no the context says that season two and three were called ""The New Adventures of Wonder Woman "" with a new cast except for Carter and Waggoner. So in the first season which was just called ""Wonder Woman "" Lynda Carter played Wonder Woman/Diana Prince right? Because it's capitalized as Wonder Woman in the first part.  So the answer should be Lynda Carter who played the original version of Wonder Woman in the 1975-1978 series.

The context provided mentions that the United States was involved in the Kosovo declaration of independence and their stance on it. It also talks about other countries like the UK France Russia China having different positions.  But wait I'm supposed to focus on who developed U.S. foreign policy. From what I know a country's foreign policy is usually shaped by its leaders and the government. The U.S. being an advanced nation has had many leaders who have influenced its policies through treaties speeches and diplomatic actions.  Looking at the context again the UN Security Council discussion around Kosovo shows that the U.S. UK and France supported Kosovo's independence while Russia and China had reservations. This indicates that the U.S. played a significant role in shaping their foreign policy decisions regarding international relations especially with other countries like Serbia and Russia.  I think the main players would be the U.S. government leaders who set the direction for U.S. foreign policy. Without specific information on which leader exactly made a major decision here it's reasonable to point towards the United States as the primary player because they have consistently been key in shaping their own policies over time.

Question: when did harvard become an ivy league school
Answer: ",Okay so I'm trying to figure out when Harvard became part of the Ivy League. I remember that Harvard was one of the original Seven Universities established in 1733 right? But I think it might have been granted Ivy League status at some point after that.  From what I recall there were changes in the Ivy League over time. I believe some schools joined later than others. I'm pretty sure Yale became part of the Ivy League in the late 19th century maybe around 1880s or something like that. Since Harvard is often mentioned alongside Yale when talking about the original Ivies it's possible they joined together.  Wait but was Harvard already considered an Ivy League school before some other schools joined? I think the initial seven were part of a confederation called the Seven Universities Conference which later became the Ivy League. So maybe Harvard joined earlier than some others. Let me see... If Yale got in around 1884 perhaps Harvard followed soon after.  Hmm but I'm not entirely sure when exactly Harvard was admitted to the Ivy League. I think it might have been a bit later because of some administrative changes or because other schools were looking to join first. Maybe Harvard joined during the early 20th century maybe around 1905 or so? But I could be mixing up the exact year.  Wait I should probably check if there's any information on when Harvard specifically joined. From what I've read before Yale became an Ivy League school in 1884 and Harvard followed soon after maybe around 1890s. So perhaps Harvard was admitted to the Ivy League between 1887 and 1895.  But actually now that I think about it some sources say that Harvard was already part of the confederation before Yale joined in 1884. So maybe Harvard wasn't part of the original group but became an Ivy League school later on as others like Yale Columbia Penn Princeton and Chicago joined around 1880s-1920s.  Wait I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to organize this. The original Seven Universities were Yale Dartmouth Harvard Columbia Penn Princeton and Chicago. They formed the Seven Universities Conference in 1763 or so? Wait no that's too early because the Ivy League didn't exist then; it was formed much later.  Actually the Ivy League started with seven schools: Columbia Yale University of Pennsylvania Princeton Dartmouth College Brown and Harvard. So wait those are the original seven from what I've read. So in 1905 they became an official league. But were some of them already part of it before? For example Yale joined in 1884.  So maybe Harvard was one of the original schools that formed the Ivy League along with others like Brown and Dartmouth. Wait no I thought Harvard wasn't originally part of the confederation until later because they were expelled or something else happened.  Wait perhaps Harvard wasn't part of the original Ivy League group but joined later when other schools like Yale did. So maybe Harvard became an Ivy League school in 1905 as well along with Brown and Dartmouth? Or was it after that?  I'm getting a bit tangled up here. I think I need to clarify this properly. Let me break it down step by step.  First the original seven universities were Yale Dartmouth Harvard Columbia Penn Princeton and Chicago. They formed the Seven Universities Conference in 1763? No that can't be right because the Ivy League didn't exist yet; perhaps they formed a different organization at an earlier time but it's not directly related to the Ivy League.  Wait no I think the original seven universities were established as part of a conference that would later become the Ivy League. So in 1905 they officially became the Ivy League. That means Harvard joined then along with Brown and Dartmouth because those three formed the first trio before the rest joined later. So maybe in 1905 Harvard was admitted to the Ivy League.  But I've heard that Yale joined earlier around 1884. So perhaps Yale was among the first to join the Ivy League followed by others like Brown and Dartmouth in 1905. Then Harvard joined later as well maybe around the same time?  Wait now I'm getting conflicting information. Some sources say that Yale became an Ivy League school in 1884 while others mention that Harvard was admitted to the Ivy League in 1923 along with Brown and Dartmouth.  I think I need to look for a reliable source to confirm when Harvard joined the Ivy League specifically.

Question: who were the first kings to issue coins bearing their names
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who the first kings were to issue coins with their names in the context of Pulumavi IV from r. 217 to 224 CE. Hmm let's break this down.  First I'm not entirely sure what ""r. 217"" means. Maybe it refers to the reign period so Ramesa IV ruled from 217 to 224 CE. That makes sense because the name Pulumavi IV suggests it's a continuation of an older line or family.  Now I remember that in ancient India kings would issue coins as a form of currency and record-keeping. The coins often had the king's image and maybe his name on them. So if Pulumavi IV is one of these kings he might have been among the first to do this.  Wait but the question asks for the first kings who did this. If Pulumavi IV was around in 217-224 CE then perhaps there were earlier kings before him who also issued coins with their names. But without more context it's hard to say exactly who they were.  I think the process of issuing coins with king's names started much earlier maybe during the Ashoka era or even earlier. But since I don't have specific information about the first few kings in this region I can only speculate that Pulumavi IV was one of them.  Pulumavi IV ruling from 217 to 224 CE issued coins with his name. While it's unclear who the first kings were before him it's likely that earlier rulers also issued such coins as part of their administrative practices.

Daniel Craig was cast as this lead because he has experience with action roles and can portray someone intense enough for a criminal.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the Cowboys started playing on Thanksgiving Day based on the provided context. The context mentions that the Cowboys Thanksgiving game has been the most watched NFL regular season telecast each year and it also notes that the Lions Thanksgiving game is usually in the top five.  Hmm wait a minute. So the context is talking about both the Cowboys and the Lions playing on Thanksgiving Day each year. It says that the Cowboys' game is consistently the most watched which suggests they've been doing this for a while. But when exactly did they start?  I'm not sure if the context gives specific years. It just mentions ""each year"" without providing any dates or specific seasons. So maybe I need to infer from general knowledge instead of relying solely on the context provided.  Usually NFL games are played on Thanksgiving week around the 20s or early 30s of the month. But considering that the Cowboys have a long history in the league and have been playing on Thanksgiving for many years perhaps it's as far back as the beginning of their existence.  Wait I think the Cowboys were founded much later than most other NFL teams. They joined the NFL in 1971. That would mean they started playing on Thanksgiving Day starting in 1971 but that seems a bit early because I thought they might have started a few years later.  Alternatively maybe the context is implying that they've been playing every Thanksgiving since their inception. So if they joined in 1971 then their first Thanksgiving game was in 1972 or so. But without specific information from the context it's hard to pin down an exact year.  Wait but looking back at the context again: ""The Cowboys Thanksgiving game has regularly been the most watched NFL regular season telecast each year."" This implies that they've been playing on Thanksgiving every year since a certain point. The Lions' game is also mentioned as usually in the top five.  If both teams play on Thanksgiving every year then it's probably for many years now. So maybe starting from when the Cowboys joined the league? They were formed in 1971 and joined the NFL in 1972 after a pro football league called the Texas Rangers was renamed. So their first Thanksgiving game would have been in 1972.  But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes teams might have had off seasons or other games scheduled around Thanksgiving. Also considering that NFL scheduling can vary and some teams might have had bye weeks or different game days it's possible they started earlier than 1972 maybe even before the Cowboys joined.  Alternatively perhaps the context is suggesting a longer history but without specific years I'm limited to what I know about NFL history. The Cowboys' first season was in 1972 against the Green Bay Packers so their first Thanksgiving game would have been that year.  But wait maybe they started earlier because they were part of a pro football league prior to joining the NFL? No they joined the NFL in 1972 after the Texas Rangers became Cowboys. So their first season was 1972-73 with the regular season starting around late September or early October.  Given that Thanksgiving is usually on a Thursday in November which comes after the regular season concludes in December but some games might be scheduled earlier depending on the schedule.  Wait I'm getting confused. NFL seasons are from late September to mid-December. Thanksgiving is typically in November so many games are played around then. The Cowboys' first season was 1972-73 with their regular season ending in December 1973. So their first Thanksgiving game would have been the week before or after that.  But without specific information from the context I can't be certain. The context doesn't provide exact years when they started playing on Thanksgiving Day only that it's a tradition for them each year since they've been in existence.  The Cowboys' Thanksgiving Day game has been part of their NFL history since 1972 with their first season being the 1972-1973 campaign. Their first Thanksgiving game would have taken place around that time though the exact scheduling details can vary.

Question: when was fingerprinting first used by the police
Answer: ",Alright so I need to figure out when fingerprinting was first used by the police based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that fingerprint analysis has led to many crimes being solved and notes that this means many criminals consider gloves essential. It also states that in 2015 the identification of sex by a fingerprint test has been reported. Additionally it says that human fingerprints are detailed nearly unique difficult to alter and durable.  Wait but where does it mention when fingerprinting started being used by police? The context talks about its use since the early 20th century. So maybe that's referring to the general practice of using fingerprints for identification rather than specifically by the police.  Hmm so if it says fingerprint analysis has been in use since the early 20th century perhaps that includes both the use by the police and other authorities. But I'm not sure about the exact origin of police usage. Maybe I should look up some general information to confirm but based on what's provided here.  The context doesn't explicitly state when police first used fingerprinting only that it has been in use since the early 20th century. So perhaps the answer is around that time maybe 1900 or so.  Fingerprinting was first used by the police during the early 20th century likely as early as 1907.,fingerprinting was first used by police during early 20th century likely as early as 1907,the early 20th century,0,0.33333333333333337,2.41528400000243,0.0008419749288534122,0.00024722117551451996,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when did the ottoman empire surrender in ww1
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the Ottoman Empire surrendered in World War I based on the context provided. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context mentions that on October 30 1918 the Armistice of Mudros was signed. It ended Ottoman involvement in World War I. Then it says that the Ottoman public had misleadingly positive impressions of the armistice's severity. They thought its terms were more lenient than they actually were which caused later discontent because the Allies had not kept their promises regarding the terms.  So putting this together the Armistice of Mudros was signed on October 30 1918. That should be when the Ottoman Empire surrendered. I don't think there's any other date mentioned in the context for surrendering earlier or later than that. Therefore the answer must be October 30 1918.

Question: who was in charge of the revolutionary war
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out who was in charge of the Revolutionary War based on the given context. Let me look at the context provided.  The context says that ""today more than 100 battlefields and historic sites of the American Revolution are protected and maintained by governments."" It also mentions that ""the National Park Service alone owns and maintains more than 50 battlefield parks and sites related to the Revolution.""  Hmm but the question is about who was in charge of the Revolutionary War. The context doesn't directly mention a leader or governing body from back then. It's talking about current protections and maintenance by governments today.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The context doesn't provide information on who led the war; instead it talks about modern efforts to protect sites related to the Revolution. So perhaps the answer isn't in the provided context at all.  But since the question is asking for an answer and assuming this data comes from a reliable source like a history textbook or official document maybe I can infer that the Revolutionary War was led by certain key figures who are mentioned elsewhere. However given only this context it's not possible to determine the leaders directly.  Alternatively perhaps the context refers to George Washington as the in charge since he is often credited with leading the American forces during the Revolution. But without explicit mention I can't be sure. The context doesn't specify a leader; it just talks about current protections.

The franchise is able to keep costs down by using a common ticketing system , aircraft livery , employee uniforms , and management style .
Question: what is the difference between airasia x and airasia
Answer: ",Alright so I need to figure out the difference between AirAsia X and regular AirAsia. From the context given it says that AirAsia X is the medium and long-haul operation of the brand AirAsia which is Asia's largest low-cost carrier. It also mentions that AirAsia X uses a common ticketing system aircraft livery employee uniforms and management style with AirAsia.  Hmm so I guess AirAsia X is a separate entity from the main AirAsia right? Since it's their medium and long-haul operation. That probably means they focus on flights between medium-sized cities or longer routes compared to their other services. The common ticketing system suggests that passengers can use the same tickets for both operations which would make traveling easier.  The aircraft livery being common too implies that the planes used by AirAsia X look similar to those in regular AirAsia. So no major differences in the plane appearance. Similarly employee uniforms and management style indicate consistency across both operations.   I think the main difference is just the route focus—medium and long-haul vs maybe shorter or different routes for another service. But since all other systems are common it seems like they're part of the same company but specialize in a particular segment.  So putting that together AirAsia X operates specifically on medium and long-haul flights using similar systems as regular AirAsia to maintain consistency across their network.  AirAsia X is focused on medium and long-haul routes utilizing common ticketing aircraft uniforms and management style with the main AirAsia. This specialization allows for streamlined operations and consistency while catering to longer-distance travel needs.,airasia x is focused on medium and longhaul routes utilizing common ticketing aircraft uniforms and management style with main airasia this specialization allows for streamlined operations and consistency while catering to longerdistance travel needs,AirAsia X is the medium and long-haul operation of the brand AirAsia,0,0.2727272727272727,2.7573944000032498,0.0009592836373213428,0.00028166542772642997,0.0,0.0,0.0

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out when the words ""under God"" were added to the Pledge of Allegiance. Let me go through the context provided step by step.

Question: who has won the most college football national champions
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who has won the most college football national championships based on the context provided. Let me start by looking at the information given.  The context lists several schools with their respective championship wins:  - Princeton: 28 - Yale: 27 - Alabama: 22 - Notre Dame: 22 - Oklahoma: 17 - USC: 17 - Michigan: 16 - Ohio State: 16 - Harvard: 12 - Nebraska: 11 - Pittsburgh: 11 - Miami (FL): 9 - Minnesota: 9 - Texas: 9 - Florida State: 8 - LSU: 8 - Georgia Tech:7 - Penn State:7 - Tennessee:7 - Georgia:6 - Michigan State:6 - Penn:6 - Iowa:5 (seems like a group of schools with 5 each) - Army Auburn California Cornell Florida Illinois Washington Lafayette Ole Miss SMU TCU Texas A&M Arizona State Arkansas Chicago Clemson Maryland Missouri Oklahoma State Stanford BYU Centre Colgate Colorado Columbia Dartmouth Detroit Kentucky Navy Purdue Rutgers Syracuse UCF UCLA Utah Washington & Jefferson Wisconsin.  Wait a minute so the context is listing each school's total championships. The highest number here is 28 for Princeton and 27 for Yale. Then Alabama and Notre Dame have 22 each. Following that are Oklahoma with 17 and USC also at 17. Michigan and Ohio State share 16 wins then Harvard has 12.  Looking further down Nebraska and Pittsburgh both have 11 and there's a group of schools with 9 wins: Miami Minnesota Texas Florida State and LSU each having 8 or 9. Then there are several schools at 7 like Georgia Tech Penn State Tennessee and Georgia.  The next tier includes Michigan State Penn Iowa which each have 5 and then a larger group of schools with 6 wins: Michigan Ohio State? Wait no wait—I think I got that wrong. Let me check again.  Wait in the context provided after listing several schools at 7 it goes down to 6 for Michigan State Penn (I assume this is University of Pennsylvania?) and Iowa each with 5. Then a list starts with Army at 5 then Auburn California Cornell Florida Illinois Washington Lafayette Ole Miss SMU TCU etc. all with varying counts but the highest in that group seems to be 5.  Wait no—the context is long and lists each school's number. So looking for who has the most national champions it's clear that Princeton (28) and Yale (27) are at the top. But since the question asks for ""who has won the most "" plural or singular? Probably singular because it's asking in general.  Wait no—the question is ""who has won the most college football national champions."" So looking for which school(s) have the highest number.  So based on the numbers given Princeton has 28 Yale has 27. Then Alabama and Notre Dame at 22 each. So the top two are Princeton and Yale with the most championships.

It also flourished economically due to its control of the major overland trade routes between Europe and Asia .
Question: who ruled the ottoman empire in the 1500s
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who ruled the Ottoman Empire during the 1500s based on the given context. Let me start by reading the context carefully again.  The context says that during the 15th and 16th centuries the Ottoman Empire went through a period of expansion. It mentions that the Empire prospered under the rule of a line of committed and effective Sultans. Also it flourished economically because of controlling major overland trade routes between Europe and Asia.  So focusing on the question: ""Who ruled the Ottoman Empire in the 1500s?"" The key part here is the time frame—1500s. From the context it's talking about both the 15th (which would be late 1400s) and 16th centuries (early 1500s). Therefore the period in question is likely within that timeframe.  The context specifies a line of Sultans who were ""committed and effective."" So I think it's referring to a specific line or dynasty. In history the Ottoman Empire had several sultanates under different lines but one prominent line was the decline after the Fatimids which included the Beylik period leading up to the decline.  Wait actually there was a shift from the late 15th century into the early 16th century when the empire started losing territory. The last sultanate before decline might have been the Beylik. So perhaps the answer is that the last sultan was Ahmet III or someone close to him.  But in the context provided it's mentioned that during this period of expansion and prosperity the Sultans were ""committed and effective."" That suggests a line of rulers rather than just one individual. However without more specific information maybe the answer is referring to the last sultan before the empire began to decline.  Looking back at the context it says the Empire flourished economically under their control of trade routes. This period would have been the late 15th and early 16th centuries which overlaps with when the last sultans were ruling.  So putting it all together the rulers during this time were a group known as the Beylik and the last ruler was Ahmet III. Therefore I can conclude that Ahmet III was the Sultan who ruled during that period.

Question: who has a ring of power in lotr
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out who from ""The Lord of the Rings"" has a ring of power. From what I remember about J.R.R. Tolkien's work there are several rings that play significant roles. The One Ring is obviously key because it's associated with Sauron and his quest for power. Then there's the Silver Ring which is connected to Galadriel. Also there's the Amulet of Imladris. But wait the question specifically mentions a ""ring of power "" so maybe they're referring to something more prominent like the One Ring or perhaps another major one.  I should double-check if Sauron had rings too. Yes he had three gold rings but are those considered his ring of power? Or is it more about the One Ring that holds all the powers together. I think in the context of LOTR lore the One Ring is often highlighted as having immense power because it's been forged with power from different races and contains Sauron's spirit.  So putting this together The Lord of the Rings has several rings of power: the One Ring Silver Ring Amulet of Imladris and Sauron's three gold rings. But if the question is asking for one probably the One Ring because it's central to the story.  The One Ring holds immense power in The Lord of the Rings serving as a focal point of the conflict between the fellowship and Sauron.

Question: what's the largest city park in the united states
Answer: ","Alright so I need to figure out which is the largest city park in the United States based on the data provided. Let me start by going through each entry and noting down the key information.  First I see that there are entries with 'City' names followed by some numbers. The format seems to be something like '7006...' which might represent a unique identifier or code for each park but I don't think it's necessary for determining size. The next part is '*[Size]' where the first number could be the area in square miles (or maybe acres) and the second number is probably elevation but since they're all around 400-500 except some I'm not sure. Then there are more numbers that might represent different measurements like length or width.  I think the main focus should be on finding which park has the largest area. So looking at the entries:  - The first entry after New York is ""New York City"" with Van Cortlandt Park having 1 146.0 for some measure and 463.8 for another. - Then there's Philadelphia Boston etc. each with their own numbers.  Wait I see that the last few entries have ""1 291.0"" under Size. That stands out because it's higher than many others. Let me check which city that is: it says ""Emma Long Metropolitan Park"" in Austin Texas. So 1 291.0 and 522.4. The second number might be elevation again but the first one is definitely larger.  Looking through other entries I don't see any higher than 1 291 except for a few in the 1 000s. So it's likely that Emma Long Metropolitan Park in Austin is the largest. Also the fact that it has ""1 291.0"" suggests maybe square miles or another unit but regardless it's higher than all others listed.  I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any larger numbers. Scanning through again none of the other parks have a first number over 1 291. So yes that must be the largest.  The largest city park in the United States is Emma Long Metropolitan Park in Austin Texas with an area of **1 291 square miles** (5 224 acres).", largest city park in united states is emma long metropolitan park in austin texas with area of 1291 square miles 5224 acres,Franklin Mountains State Park,0,0.07692307692307693,4.889185500011081,0.0017301518011957257,0.0005080081929430457,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: what year is it for the jewish calendar
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out the current year in the Jewish calendar based on the information given. Let me start by understanding the context provided.  The context says that AM 5778 began at sunset on September 20 2017 and will end at sunset on September 9 2018. I know that the Jewish calendar uses lunar months instead of solar or lunar years but for this question I'm focusing on the year number.  First I should recall how the Jewish calendar relates to the Gregorian calendar (which is used in most Western countries). The current Jewish year as of 2023 would be 5783. So starting from a certain point each subsequent Jewish year increments by one each Gregorian year until an adjustment is needed.  The provided context spans from AM 5778 to the next year which suggests that sometimes there's a discrepancy because a lunar year can have either 12 or 13 months. This causes a difference between the solar year and the lunar year leading to adjustments in the year numbering every few years.  In this case AM 5778 starts on September 20 2017 which would be the start of that year. The next Jewish year begins about a month after Passover so if 2017's Amal began on September 20 and 5778 is considered complete by September 9 2018 it implies that another adjustment was needed because sometimes an extra month is added every 17 or 34 years.  Given the timeline from 2017 to 2018 adding one year brings us to AM 5779. However due to the addition of a leap month (Adar II) which extends the year further we need to account for that by subtracting two years because those months are part of the next cycle.  So starting from September 2017 as AM 5778 and adding one Gregorian year would bring us to around March 2019 (since the leap month Adar II is added at the end typically in the spring). But since we're going up to September 2018 which doesn't include that extra month yet perhaps it's still considered part of AM 5778.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The context shows that AM 5778 starts on September 20 2017 and ends on September 9 2018. So from that start date to the end date spans exactly one year in the Gregorian calendar but includes a leap month added at the end of the previous year.  This means that if AM 5778 started on September 20 2017 and ended on September 9 2018 it includes the leap month Adar II from the previous year. Therefore when considering a point in time within the period of AM 5778 up to its end (September 9 2018) that would correspond to 5783 in the Jewish calendar.  Wait but earlier I thought it was 5783 as of 2023. Let me verify this again. The current year for the Jewish calendar in 2023 is indeed 5783 because each regular Gregorian year adds one to the year number until a leap year causes an adjustment.  Since AM 5778 started on September 20 2017 and ended on September 9 2018 which includes the addition of the Adar II month in 2018. So when we count from that start date up to its end it's effectively adding one year (to 5779) but then subtracting because of the leap month.  Wait no perhaps I'm mixing up the direction. Let me think: If AM 5778 starts on September 20 2017 and ends on September 9 2018 that means that by September 20 2018 we have completed AM 5779 because the end date is in 2018. But the context says it will end at sunset on September 9 2018 so up until that point would be part of AM 5778.  But I'm getting confused here. Maybe a better approach is to understand that each Gregorian year corresponds roughly to an increase in the Jewish year by one except when a leap month is added. Since we're going from September 2017 (AM 5778) to September 2018 and knowing that Adar II was inserted before March 2019 so the transition happens within 2018.  Thus up to March 2018 it would be AM 5778 but after that including Adar II it becomes AM 5779. So when counting from September 2017 through September 2018 the corresponding Jewish years are 5778 and 5779.  But since the period includes the addition of a month in 2018 (Adar II) we need to adjust the year count accordingly. So starting from AM 5778 on September 20 2017 adding one year would bring us to the same date in 2018 without any adjustments which is September 20 2018 corresponding to 5779. However because we've added a leap month (Adar II) this affects the count.  Wait I'm getting myself tangled up here. Let me try a different approach. The current year in the Jewish calendar as of now would be determined by how many years have passed since AM 1. Since each regular year adds one and when an extra month is added it effectively subtracts two from the count because adding a month causes the next year to start earlier.  So starting from AM 5778 on September 20 2017 which would correspond to 5783 in 2023. If we're looking at the period up until September 9 2018 (which is within the same year as AM 5778 but ending before Adar II is fully added) perhaps it's still part of 5778.  But no that can't be right because in reality each Gregorian year corresponds to a single Jewish year unless a leap month is inserted. Since we're adding a leap month within the period up to September 2018 that means we've effectively added two years back from where it would land by March 2019.  Wait maybe I should use an example: if today's date was around March 2018 then AM 5778 would have ended in that year with the addition of Adar II. So as of March 2018 we'd be at AM 5779 but since Adar II is added before March 2019 perhaps by September 2018 it's still part of 5778.  This is confusing. Let me try to find a formula or rule. The general approach is that the current Jewish year can be calculated as:  Jewish Year = Gregorian Year + (number of leap months added) - adjustments  But I'm not sure. Alternatively knowing that each regular Gregorian year corresponds to one Jewish year and when an Adar II month is inserted in a particular year it effectively subtracts two from the year count.  So for example if 2017 had an Adar II insertion before March 2018 then by September 2017 (when AM 5778 starts) we were still at 5778. But when March comes around it becomes 5779.  Wait no that can't be right because the Adar II is added in the same year but after March. So if we're counting from September 2017 to September 2018 and Adar II was inserted before March 2018 then by March 2018 it's part of 5779.  But since the period in question ends on September 9 2018 perhaps that is still within 5778 because Adar II wasn't added yet. So if today was September 9 2018 we would be at the end of AM 5778.  But wait I'm not sure. Let me recall that the Jewish year cycles every 19 years for regular months but when leap months are inserted it shifts the year count.  If we consider that each time a leap month is added before March it effectively subtracts two from the year count because adding a month causes the next month's number to be one less. So if we had an Adar II insertion in 2018 (before March 2019) then as of September 2018 that would mean the current year is 5779 minus two? Or perhaps plus something.  Alternatively maybe a better way is to use an online converter or formula. But since I can't do that now let's think logically.  As of September 20 2017 (start of AM 5778) the next Adar II would be added before March 2019. So by September 2018 we're still within the same year as when Adar II was inserted? No because the insertion happens after that date.  Wait if the period ends on September 9 2018 which is during 2018 but before Adar II is added (which would be in 2019) then perhaps up until that point we're still within AM 5778. But when considering the full year of 2018 with the leap month inserted after September it's no longer part of 5778.  This is really confusing. Maybe I should accept that as of now in 2023 the current Jewish year is 5783 because each Gregorian year adds one unless a leap month is added which causes an adjustment by subtracting two years.  So given that AM 5778 started on September 2017 and ended on September 2018 with the addition of Adar II before March 2019 then as of now in 2023 it's three years after that (since 2018 + 5 = 2023) so adding five to AM 5778 would bring us to 5783.  Therefore the current Jewish year is 5783.  The current year in the Jewish calendar as of September 9 2018 is **5783**., current year in jewish calendar as of september 9 2018 is 5783,AM 5778,0,0.0,18.36232650000602,0.006537046502169845,0.0019194114519066308,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: when was the last bear killed in the uk
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out when the last bear was killed in the UK based on the provided context. Let me start by going through the information given about different animals and their historical status.  First looking at the list there's mention of several bears. The Eurasian beaver was reintroduced in 1526 but that's not a bear. Then there's the Eurasian brown bear with a c. 1000 AD meaning around 1000 AD. The Eurasian lynx is mentioned as c. AD 400 so also early to mid-AD times.  Wait I'm looking for bears specifically killed in the UK. There's the grey whale killed around 598 BC but that's not a bear. Then there's the Eurasian wolf which was killed in Britain in AD 1680 and Ireland in 1786. So those are two instances.  I should check if there are any other bears listed. The Saiga antelope is mentioned as c. 10 000 BC so that's much earlier. There's also the European jaguar with an unknown date and the European Ice Age leopard at 24 000 BC which are way before the period we're talking about.  The only bears mentioned in more recent times are the Eurasian brown bear around 1000 AD and the Eurasian wolf around 1680. Since the question is about when the last bear was killed I should consider both these dates. The wolf was killed later than the brown bear. So the last bear would be the wolf.  Wait but in the UK the wolves were indeed legally permitted from AD 1679 to 1786 under the Control of Wolves Act 1765 and 1782. Therefore the last bear killed specifically in the UK would be the last wolf which was in 1786.  I should make sure there are no other bears mentioned after that period but from the context provided it seems these are the main points.  The last bear killed in the UK was the Eurasian wolf which was legally permitted for culling between AD 1679 and 1786. The final instance was in 1786.

Question: where does what in the sam hill come from
Answer: ","Alright so I have this question about where ""what in the Sam Hill"" comes from. Let me try to figure this out based on the context provided.  The context talks about Kentucky Samuel Ewing Hill who was the adjutant general of Kentucky. He was sent by the governor to investigate a feud between the Hatfields and McCoys. The feud got really bad with over a dozen people killed or injured from 1880 to 1891. Because of this governors from both Kentucky and West Virginia called up their militias to stop it. Even the governor of West Virginia threatened to invade Kentucky.  Then the governor of Kentucky sent Hill to Pike County to look into the situation. Newspapers across the country were waiting for news about Hill's findings.  So ""what in the Sam Hill"" is referring to the information or report that Hill brought back from his investigation. The question is asking where this phrase comes from. Well looking at the context it says newspapers awaited word from Hill to find out what was going on. That means the phrase likely comes from the newspapers wanting to know the outcome of Hill's investigation.  Wait but in the first part of the context it mentions that ""the governor... sent his adjutant general Sam Hill to Pike County Kentucky to investigate the situation."" So Hill went there and did an investigation. Then the newspapers were waiting for his report. Therefore the phrase ""what in the Sam Hill"" probably refers to the information or findings from Hill's investigation that was being sought by the newspapers.  I think I'm overcomplicating it but to make sure: The question is asking where does ""what in the Sam Hill"" come from. From the context it seems like this phrase comes from the newspapers looking for news about Hill's investigation. So the origin is the newspapers wanting information on what happened during his investigation.  The phrase ""what in the Sam Hill"" refers to the information or findings from Kentucky Samuel Ewing Hill's investigation into the Hatfields and McCoys feud.

Question: where did the battle of freeman's farm take place
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the Battle of Freeman's Farm took place. Let me start by looking at the context provided.  First the context mentions several battles part of the American Revolutionary War specifically the Saratoga campaign. There's a painting called ""Surrender of General Burgoyne"" by John Trumbull which hangs in the United States Capitol Rotunda. The date is September 19 and October 7 1777 location is Stillwater Saratoga County New York. Coordinates are given as 42°59′56″N 73°38′15″W.  Then there's a result section with Freeman's Farm marked as a British pyrrhic victory and Bemis Heights as a decisive American victory. The dates mentioned for British surrender is October 17 so that might be the end of the battle at Bemis Heights on October 17.  Looking at the belligerents: United States Canadian Auxiliaries Great Britain Quebec Loyalists. Commanders listed include Horatio Gates Benedict Arnold etc. Strengths and casualties numbers are provided for each battle.  Wait but the question is about where the Battle of Freeman's Farm took place. I know that Freeman's Farm was a significant battlefield in the Saratoga War. From what I remember it was near the village of Freeman's Farm in Saratoga County New York. But let me cross-check with the context.  In the context the first battle mentioned is at Stillwater on September 19-October 7 which seems to be a larger battle maybe Bemis Heights or another point. Then there's the surrender of Burgoyne in Stillwater on October 17. Freeman's Farm might have been a smaller battle nearby.  Wait looking again the context doesn't explicitly mention Freeman's Farm as one of the battles listed with specific dates and locations. It does list the results for battles at Freeman's Farm and Bemis Heights. So perhaps Freeman's Farm was another location within the Saratoga area where the American forces defeated the British.  Given that the Saratoga County is in New York and Freeman's Farm is a real place there I can conclude that the battle took place near Freeman's Farm specifically in Saratoga County New York. But since the context doesn't specify the exact date for Freeman's Farm maybe it's part of the initial battle on September 19 or October 7.  Wait the first battle was at Stillwater on September 19 and October 7. Then there's another battle mentioned: British surrender October 17 at Bemis Heights. So Freeman's Farm might be a separate event before or after that.  Alternatively perhaps Freeman's Farm is part of the larger battle at Stillwater which is divided into two parts on September 19 and October 7. The first battle on September 19 was the British victory (Pyrrhic) while on October 7 it shifted to an American decisive victory at Bemis Heights.  Wait but then there's a result section: Freeman's Farm marked as a British pyrrhic victory which would correspond with the first part of the battle on September 19. So perhaps Freeman's Farm was one part of the larger battle at Stillwater specifically on September 19 when the British forces defeated the American forces leading to their retreat.  Therefore the location would be near Freeman's Farm in Saratoga County New York.

Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the last name ""Fisher"" comes from for the character Ruth Fisher from the show ""Six Feet Under."" I'm not very familiar with the origins of this last name but I remember it's a pretty common one in English-speaking countries. Maybe it's Germanic? I think German surnames often come from given names or family meanings.  Wait could it be related to farming? Fisher does sound like a place name as well so maybe the Fisher surname is also tied to farming communities. Perhaps the character Ruth Fisher has a background that reflects this like growing up on a farm in West Virginia.  I should check if there are any historical connections or family trees mentioned elsewhere about the character's origins. But since I don't have access to external resources right now I'll go with what I know: Fisher is a common English surname often of Germanic origin possibly from places like West Virginia where Ruth Fisher's story takes place.

Context: The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm 's assets , liabilities and equity ( capital ) at a set point in time , usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement . The total assets always equal the total combined liabilities and equity in dollar amount . This statement best demonstrates the basic accounting equation - Assets = Liabilities + Equity . The statement can be used to help show the status of a company .
Question: which financial statement involves all aspects of the accounting​ equation
Answer: ",Okay I need to figure out which financial statement includes all aspects of the accounting equation. From what I remember there are three main financial statements: the income statement the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. The question is asking about an accounting equation that involves all parts.  The accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. So a single financial statement that includes both assets and the other side (liabilities plus equity) would be necessary here.   Looking at each statement:  - The income statement deals with revenues and expenses which affects equity through net income or loss. - The cash flow statement covers changes in cash and cash equivalents from operating investing and financing activities. - But none of these include the full picture.  The balance sheet is where assets are listed on one side and liabilities plus equity (which includes retained earnings) on the other. Since it directly shows that Assets equal Liabilities plus Equity it encompasses all parts of the equation.   So putting it together the balance sheet uses the accounting equation to show all components.  The balance sheet incorporates all aspects of the accounting equation by displaying assets on one side and liabilities plus equity (which includes retained earnings) on the other.

Context: Groundhog Day , ( Pennsylvania German : Grund'sau dåk , Grundsaudaag , Grundsow Dawg , Murmeltiertag ; Nova Scotia : Daks Day ) is a popular tradition celebrated in the United States and Canada on February 2 . It derives from the Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that if a groundhog ( Deitsch : Grundsau , Grunddax , Dax ) emerging from its burrow on this day sees a shadow due to clear weather , it will retreat to its den and winter will persist for six more weeks , and if it does not see its shadow because of cloudiness , spring will arrive early . While the tradition remains popular in modern times , studies have found no consistent correlation between a groundhog seeing its shadow or not and the subsequent arrival time of spring - like weather .
Question: what does it mean groundhog sees his shadow
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what it means when a groundhog sees its shadow on Groundhog Day. From what I remember Groundhog Day is celebrated in February and it's about whether the groundhog will see its shadow or not. If it does they say winter will stay for six more weeks but if it doesn't spring comes early.  Wait why do we have this saying? I think it has something to do with folklore and superstition. The idea is that if the groundhog sees its shadow as the sun comes out after a long winter night it means the daylight will come soon signaling the end of winter. But actually the weather's not always predictable so the saying isn't scientifically accurate.  So when does the groundhog see its shadow? I think it has to do with whether there's clear weather on that day or if there are clouds. If the groundhog comes out and sees a shadow cast by the sun it means the ground is bright because of the sun. So seeing a shadow would mean the groundhog thinks winter will continue right?  I should make sure I got this straight. The key points are: Groundhog Day on February 2nd; if the groundhog sees its shadow (which happens when there's clear sky) it means winter is coming longer; no real effect on the actual weather based on that.  Wait does the groundhog actually see a shadow? Because in reality if the sun comes out after dark the ground would be bright. So the groundhog emerging from its burrow and seeing its own shadow probably happens when there's daylight because it was just coming out of hiding during the long winter night.  So putting it all together: on Groundhog Day if a groundhog sees its shadow (i.e. the sun is out and casting light) it indicates that winter will persist longer. If it doesn't see its shadow (maybe because there are clouds blocking the sunlight) spring might come earlier.  When a groundhog sees its shadow on Groundhog Day it means the sun has emerged from the winter night suggesting that daylight will arrive soon possibly indicating the end of winter and the arrival of spring. This is part of a folklore superstition where seeing a shadow foretells continued winter while not seeing one might signal an early spring.,when groundhog sees its shadow on groundhog day it means sun has emerged from winter night suggesting that daylight will arrive soon possibly indicating end of winter and arrival of spring this is part of folklore superstition where seeing shadow foretells continued winter while not seeing one might signal early spring,"if a groundhog (Deitsch: Grundsau, Grunddax, Dax) emerging from its burrow on this day sees a shadow due to clear weather, it will retreat to its den and winter will persist for six more weeks",0,0.2857142857142857,3.8166074000037042,0.001340842083884662,0.00039369884398899506,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: where does the last name roberts come from
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out where the last name ""Roberts"" comes from. Let me start by reading through the provided context carefully.  The context mentions that ""Roberts"" has Norman origins. It says it's derived from a Norman given name Robert. The explanation goes into Germanic elements: ""hrod"" meaning renown and ""berht"" meaning bright. So combining these gives ""robert "" which relates to brightness or fame.  Then the context explains that ""Roberts"" can mean either ""Servant of Robert"" or ""Son of Robert."" It notes that in Wales it's more common as a son's name while in England it's more for servants. The latter was probably introduced by the Normans after their conquest.  Looking further it mentions that the surname became prominent in England Wales Ireland and the Isle of Man. North Wales has the highest concentration followed by Scotland. However I'm focusing on where the name itself comes from initially not its distribution.  Putting this together: ""Roberts"" originates from Norman France derived from Robert meaning bright or renowned. Over time it evolved into a surname likely as a family name after becoming widespread in these regions post-conquest.  The last name Roberts has Norman origins deriving from the given name Robert which means ""bright renown.""

Question: where are the spore containing sori of a fern found
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out where the spore-containing sori of a fern are found based on the given context. Let me read through the context again carefully.  The context says that in ferns these spore-containing structures called sori form a yellowish or brownish mass either on the edge or under the side of a fertile frond. Additionally it mentions that some species protect these during development with something called an indusium which forms an umbrella-like cover.  So focusing on the first part: the sori are located on the edge or underside of a fertile frond. That's probably where I should put my answer. The second part is about protection by indusium but that doesn't directly tell me where the spores are; it just says they're protected there during development.  I think the key detail here is that sori form a mass on the edge or underside of the frond so that's where the spores would be. I should make sure to mention both locations in my answer but also clarify that the main location is either on the edge or under the side.

997,"Using the provided context, answer the question. Provide concise, direct answers without excessive reasoning or repetition. Context: The peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) is one of the two components of the nervous system , the other part is the central nervous system ( CNS ) . The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic .
Question: what parts make up the peripheral nervous system
Answer: ",Okay so I need to figure out what makes up the peripheral nervous system. From what I remember the nervous system has two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS is made up of the brain and spinal cord right? But this question is about the PNS.  Looking back at the context provided it says that the PNS consists of nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord. So the first part is nerves and ganglia located outside those structures.   Then the PNS is divided into two parts: the somatic nervous system (SNS) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The SNS handles voluntary movements emotions and sensory functions like touch and temperature. It includes cranial nerves except for the optic nerve. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions such as heart rate and digestion.  So putting it all together the PNS is made up of nerves and ganglia outside the CNS divided into SNS and ANS based on their functions.  The peripheral nervous system (PNS) comprises nerves and ganglia located outside the central nervous system (CNS) which includes the brain and spinal cord. It is further divided into two subsystems: the somatic nervous system (SNS) responsible for voluntary movements and sensory functions primarily composed of cranial nerves except for the optic nerve; and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) which handles involuntary bodily functions such as heart rate and digestion., peripheral nervous system pns comprises nerves and ganglia located outside central nervous system cns which includes brain and spinal cord it is further divided into two subsystems somatic nervous system sns responsible for voluntary movements and sensory functions primarily composed of cranial nerves except for optic nerve and autonomic nervous system ans which handles involuntary bodily functions such as heart rate and digestion,nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord,0,0.19718309859154926,2.5931848000036553,0.0008980533421988198,0.00026368695233654514,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: how long is a uk mobile phone number
Answer: ","Okay so I need to figure out how long a UK mobile phone number is based on the context provided. The context mentions ""07xxx xxxxxx"" which looks like a mobile phone number because it starts with 07. Mobile numbers in the UK typically start with 07 or sometimes 08 for special services but most commonly 07.  Now looking at the numbers after the area code: it's 07 followed by some more digits. The example given is ""07xxx xxxxxx"" which breaks down into four parts: 0 (the operator) 7 (the beginning of the mobile number) then several x's representing the actual digits.  Wait actually I should recall that in the UK mobile numbers are usually 11 digits long. The first two digits determine the network so it's either 07 or 08 for mobiles. Then comes the line number and handset identifier.  So if we take the example ""07xxx xxxxxx"" let me count the digits: 0 is one then 7 is two followed by five more to make six but that doesn't add up to 11. Hmm maybe I'm miscounting. Let's see: 07 is two digits then maybe it's ""xxx"" which is three making five so far and then another seven? Wait that would be 2+3+6=11? No wait let me think again.  Actually the correct structure is 07 followed by a line number. So 07 plus 9 more digits makes it up to 11 in total. So ""07xxx xxxxxx"" probably isn't exactly how it's structured because when written out mobile numbers are usually written as 07xxxxxxxxx (without the spaces). Wait but that would be 07 followed by nine x's? No actually no: each x represents one digit.  Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me break it down step by step:  - The first two digits are always 07 or 08 for mobiles. - After that the next eight digits make up the line number and identifier. - So in total a UK mobile phone number is 11 digits.  Therefore ""07xxx xxxxxx"" would be an example where after 07 there are nine more digits (including spaces as separators). But when written without spaces it's just 07 followed by ten more numbers. Wait no: actually the entire number should have 11 digits in total.  Wait maybe I'm confusing with North American numbers which are ten digits. In the UK mobiles start with 07 or 08 and then have nine digits after that? That can't be because 2+9=11 digits in total. So a full number would look like 07xxxxxxxxx (without spaces) making it 11 characters including the initial two.  But looking back at the context the example is ""07xxx xxxxxx"" which with spaces is seven digits after 07: 3 before space and 4 after? No that's adding up to six digits. Wait no let me count each character:  - 0 (1) - 7 (2) - x (3) x (4) x (5) - so three more making five - Then a space: sixth - Another seven x's? That would be 6 +7=13 which is way too long.  Wait perhaps the context was written with spaces for readability but in reality it's all one continuous string. So ""07xxx xxxxxx"" without spaces would actually be 07 followed by eight more digits making a total of 10? But that contradicts what I know about UK mobile numbers having 11 digits.  Wait no wait: the correct structure is operator (0 or 2-9) then user number. For mobiles it's 07 to 09 or maybe up to 09 but usually 07 and 08 are common for different services. Then after that comes the actual line number.  So a UK mobile phone number is 11 digits: starting with 07 or 08 followed by nine more digits? No wait no—because 07 plus ten digits would be twelve which isn't correct. Hmm perhaps I'm mixing up the breakdown.  Wait actually in the UK mobile numbers are 11 digits long. They start with 07 or 08 (or sometimes other operators) but more commonly 07 for most services. So after the first two digits (like 07) there's nine more digits? No that would be 2+9=11 total.  Wait no: let me think again. If you have 07 followed by eight x's and then a space and another seven x's how does that add up?  Actually perhaps the context was just an example with spaces for clarity so ""07xxx xxxxxx"" is actually representing 07123456789 as an example. So counting each character: 0-7 makes two then five more (making seven) and four after the space but that's eleven digits in total.  Wait no—actually maybe it's ""07"" followed by nine digits making twelve? No I'm getting confused here.  I think the key point is that UK mobile phone numbers are 11 digits long. So regardless of how they're represented with spaces or notations the actual number has 11 characters after considering all necessary parts like operator and line numbers.  A UK mobile phone number consists of 11 digits starting with either 07 or 08 for mobile services.", uk mobile phone number consists of 11 digits starting with either 07 or 08 for mobile services,"9 or 10 national (significant) numbers after the ""0"" trunk code",0,0.07407407407407408,9.632781799999066,0.0033963400127554194,0.0009972353589480538,0.0,0.0,0.0

Question: character in macbeth who is murdered and appears as a ghost
Answer: ","Okay I need to figure out which character from ""Macbeth"" is both murdered and appears as a ghost. From what I remember the play has several important characters but some are more prominent than others. Let's go through the context given.  The context mentions Lord Banquo who is a thane of Lochaber and an ally to Macbeth initially. The Three Witches predict that Macbeth will become king but they also mention that Banquo won't be king himself—he'll die but his descendants will. Then later on Macbeth kills Banquo with two assassins and his son Fleance escapes.  After this in a later scene called the banquet scene Banquo's ghost returns and causes Macbeth to react with alarm during a public feast.  So from this information it seems that Lord Banquo was killed by Macbeth. The context also specifies that his ghost appears in a later scene. Therefore he is both murdered and reappears as a ghost.
