{"question": "would a person sink in a corn silo", "answer": true, "passage": "Grain entrapment, or grain engulfment, occurs when a person becomes submerged in grain and cannot get out without assistance. This more frequently occurs at storage facilities such as silos or grain elevators, but has been known to occur around any large quantity of grain, even freestanding piles outdoors. Usually, unstable grain collapses suddenly, wholly or partially burying workers who may be within it. Entrapment occurs when victims are partially submerged but cannot remove themselves; engulfment occurs when they are completely buried within the grain. Engulfment has a very high fatality rate."}

{"question": "was beyonce married when single ladies was released", "answer": true, "passage": "``Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)'' was written by Beyonc\u00e9, Terius ``The-Dream'' Nash, Thaddis ``Kuk'' Harrell, and Christopher ``Tricky'' Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyonc\u00e9 recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized ``Single Ladies'' after Beyonc\u00e9's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was ``the only public statement that (Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z had) ever made about marriage'', and that while in the studio recording the song Beyonc\u00e9 had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyonc\u00e9's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyonc\u00e9 added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that ``people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate''. She stated that although ``Single Ladies'' is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day."}

{"question": "do cows only produce milk when they have babies", "answer": true, "passage": "To maintain lactation, a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves. Depending on market conditions, the cow may be bred with a ``dairy bull'' or a ``beef bull.'' Female calves (heifers) with dairy breeding may be kept as replacement cows for the dairy herd. If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef. Male calves can either be used later as a breeding bull or sold and used for veal or beef. Dairy farmers usually begin breeding or artificially inseminating heifers around 13 months of age. A cow's gestation period is approximately nine months. Newborn calves are removed from their mothers quickly, usually within three days, as the mother/calf bond intensifies over time and delayed separation can cause extreme stress on both cow and calf."}

It is better at defending nearby pawns than the knight is, and it is better at attacking them than the bishop is (Ward 1996:13)."}
{"question": "does the quality of air and water affect the rusting process", "answer": true, "passage": "When impure (cast) iron is in contact with water, oxygen, other strong oxidants, or acids, it rusts. If salt is present, for example in seawater or salt spray, the iron tends to rust more quickly, as a result of electrochemical reactions. Iron metal is relatively unaffected by pure water or by dry oxygen. As with other metals, like aluminium, a tightly adhering oxide coating, a passivation layer, protects the bulk iron from further oxidation. The conversion of the passivating ferrous oxide layer to rust results from the combined action of two agents, usually oxygen and water."}

{"question": "is it legal to sell organs in india", "answer": false, "passage": "Before the passage of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act (THOA) in 1994, India had a successful legal organ trading market. Low costs and high availability brought in business from around the globe, and transformed India into one of the largest kidney transplant centers in the world.

In other cases, patients were promised payments that were much higher than what they actually received. These and other ethical issues pushed the Indian government to pass legislation banning the sale of organs. Nevertheless, current laws still contain loopholes. For example, the THOA states that an organ donor must be a relative, spouse, or an individual donating for reasons of ``affection'' for the recipient. Often, claims of ``affection'' are unfounded and the organ donor has no connection to the recipient. In many cases, the donor may not be Indian or even speak the same language as the recipient."}

{"question": "is it safe to fire a gun in the air", "answer": false, "passage": "Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with terminal velocities much lower than their muzzle velocity when they leave the barrel of a firearm. Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground. Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its angular ballistic trajectory and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in free fall."}

The king is also involved in the special move of castling."}
{"question": "is lemon juice the same as citric acid", "answer": false, "passage": "Citric acid was first isolated in 1784 by the chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who crystallized it from lemon juice.

If both players are left with a bare king, the game is immediately drawn. Similarly, if one player has only a king and bishop or knight while the opponent has a bare king, the game is immediately drawn."}

{"question": "can a uterus change from retroverted to anteverted", "answer": true, "passage": "Rarely, a sharply tilted uterus is due to a disease such as endometriosis, an infection or prior surgery. Although this may make it more challenging for the sperm to reach the egg, conception can still occur. A tipped uterus will usually right itself during the 10th to 12th week of pregnancy. Rarely (1 in 3000 to 8000 pregnancies) a tipped uterus will cause painful and difficult urination, and can cause severe urinary retention. Treatment for this condition (called ``incarcerated uterus'') includes manual anteversion of the uterus, and usually requires intermittent or continuous catheter drainage of the bladder until the problem is rectified or spontaneously resolves by the natural enlargement of the uterus, which brings it out of the tipped position. In addition to manual anteversion and bladder drainage, treatment of urinary retention due to retroverted uterus can require the use of a pessary, or even surgery, but often is as simple as having the pregnant mother sleep on her stomach for a day or two, to allow the retroverted uterus to move forward."}

{"question": "planetary orbits around stars in binary systems are always unstable", "answer": true, "passage": "Further work on the system showed that the orbits proposed for the candidate planets were catastrophically unstable on timescales far shorter than the age of the system. Indeed, the authors found that the system was so unstable that it simply cannot exist, with mean lifetimes of less than a thousand years across the whole range of plausible orbital solutions. Like other planetary systems proposed around similar evolved binary star systems, it seems likely that some mechanism other than claimed planets is responsible for the observed behaviour of the binary stars - and that the claimed planets simply do not exist."}

Rear seat belts were compulsory equipment from 1986 and became compulsory for them to be worn in 1991. However, it has never been a legal requirement for cars registered before those dates to be fitted with seat belts. In one such attempt in 1979 similar claims for potential lives and injuries saved were advanced. William Rodgers, then Secretary of State for Transport in the Callaghan Labour Government (1976--1979), stated: ``On the best available evidence of accidents in this country - evidence which has not been seriously contested - compulsion could save up to 1000 lives and 10,000 injuries a year.''"}

She is a playful, smart, energetic, and friendly little blue-spotted puppy who enjoys doing fun things with her friends. She is owned by Steve (later Joe).

Though Blue cannot speak like most of the characters, she seems to be able to communicate with others through barking. In Blue's First Holiday, it is revealed that Blue played her first game of Blue's Clues trying to find Joe's duck blanket. Blue is high-spirited and believes in making people find things out by themselves instead of being told an answer automatically. Blue was born on a farm with many other puppies.

{"question": "are producers the source of all the food in an ecosystem", "answer": true, "passage": "Primary producers convert an abiotic source of energy (e.g. light) into energy stored in organic compounds, which can be used by other organisms (e.g. heterotrophs). The primary producers can convert the energy in the light (phototroph and photoautotroph) or the energy in inorganic chemical compounds (chemolithotrophs) to build organic molecules, which is usually accumulated in the form of biomass and will be used as carbon and energy source by other organisms (e.g. heterotrophs and mixotrophs). The photoautotrophs are the main primary producers, converting the energy of the light into chemical energy through photosynthesis, ultimately building organic molecules from carbon dioxide, an inorganic carbon source. Examples of chemolithotrophs are some archaea and bacteria (unicellular organisms) that produce biomass from the oxidation of inorganic chemical compounds, these organisms are called chemoautotrophs, and are frequently found in hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean. Primary producers ares at the lowest trophic level, and are the reasons why Earth is sustainable for life to this day ."}
