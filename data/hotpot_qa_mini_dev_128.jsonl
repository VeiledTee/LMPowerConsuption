the balance of payments includes all external visible and non-visible transactions of a country.", " It is an important issue to be studied, especially in international financial management field, for a few reasons.", " First, the balance of payments provides detailed information concerning the demand and supply of a country's currency.", " For example, if Mauritius imports more than it exports, then this means that the supply of rupees is likely to exceed the demand in the foreign exchanging market, \"ceteris paribus\".", " One can thus infer that the Mauritius rupee would be under pressure

foreign exchange restrictions.", " Third, balance-of-payments data can be used to evaluate the performance of the country in international economic competition.", " Suppose a country is experiencing

between two nucleotides within its recognition site, or somewhere nearby.", " For example, the common restriction enzyme EcoRI recognizes the palindromic sequence GAATTC and cuts between the G and the A on both the top and bottom strands, leaving an overhang (an end-portion of a DNA strand with no attached complement) known as a sticky end on each end of AATT.", " This overhang can then be used to ligate in (see DNA ligase) a piece of DNA with a complementary overhang (another EcoRI-cut piece, for example).", " Some restriction enzymes cut DNA at a restriction site in a manner which leaves no overhang, called a blunt end.", " Blunt ends are much less likely to be ligated by a DNA ligase because the blunt end doesn\u2019t have the overhanging base pair that the enzyme can recognize and match with a complementary pair.", " Sticky ends of DNA however are more likely to successfully bind with the help of a DNA ligase because of the exposed and unpaired nucleotides.", " For example, a sticky end trailing with AATTG is more likely to bind with a ligase than a blunt end where both the 5' and 3' DNA strands are paired.", " In the case of the example the AATTG would have a
